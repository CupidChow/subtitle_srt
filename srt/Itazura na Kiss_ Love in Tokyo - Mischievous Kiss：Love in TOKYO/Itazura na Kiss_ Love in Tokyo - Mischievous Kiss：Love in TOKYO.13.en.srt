1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Kotoko, what are you going to do?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,180
Next year, we're all going to look for jobs.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,460
We need to start doing something.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,660
I thought everyone was doing amazingly.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,940
But I thought that,

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,190
I hadn't found anything that I wanted to do.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,030
So do you think I 've been egoistic for hoping my son to,

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,800
take over my company?

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,710
Even though Naoki-kun doesn't want to,

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,500
you still have Yuki-kun

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,630
It'll be too late if we wait for Yuki to grow up

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,000
There's something that I would like to talk about.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,760
I'm thinking of you as my company's official successor.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,680
That's enough!

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,910
Not only my job,

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,130
but I also can't choose who I can love.

17
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,900
This is why I don't want to stay in this house.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,510
The house where I get tied down!

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,850
Irie-kun!

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,370
I...

21
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,470
want to become a doctor.

22
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,300
Becoming a doctor was,

23
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,560
the first job that's interested me in my life.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,360
Don't tell anyone, alright?

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,800
Such an important thing. Why'd he tell only me?

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,080
I really wanted,

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
to tell this to Naoki.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,420
Actually...

29
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,790
Honey?

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,020
Honey!

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,800
Honey, are you okay? Naoki! Naoki!

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,800
It's an unstable angina.

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,700
I've already told him the result at the last routine exam.

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,470
He has never said anything about it.

35
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,050
Really?

36
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,820
I'd assume he didn't want you to worry, so he didn't tell you.

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,110
So, how's his condition?

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,720
He's okay?

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,880
His attack this time was mild.

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,140
But if he keeps pushing himself,

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,650
there's a possibility he'll have a myocardial infarction.

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,740
Oh, no...

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,280
We'll do everything to avoid that.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,370
So he must be on bed rest and get treatment.

45
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,530
We'll see how it goes.

46
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,450
He needs to stop work completely.

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,990
Mrs. Irie, how's Iri-chan?

48
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,990
It looks like he's had a problem with his heart for a long time.

49
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,640
But he didn't show it at all to us.

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,300
I think he was pushing himself too hard.

51
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,430
Oh, no...

52
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,510
He'll be on absolute bed rest for awhile and then see how he does.

53
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,020
But he'll be okay if he's on bed rest, right?

54
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,940
So far, yes.

55
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,290
He was suffering so much.

56
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,830
I'd no idea what he was going through!

57
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm...

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,290
a failure as a wife!

59
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,550
It's not your fault, Mrs. Irie.

60
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,960
Iri-chan's always had sense of responsibility.

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm sure there's times he carried a burden by himself

62
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,970
and got stressed out.

63
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,650
Anyways, it's fortunate that this was no life-threatening situation.

64
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,690
But what about Dad's company?

65
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,340
What's going to happen to his company if he takes days off?

66
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,670
I'll do it.

67
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,630
But, Naoki.

68
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,150
You said you weren't sure if you wanted to take over the company.

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,660
I think,

70
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,570
Dad knew about the problem with his heart.

71
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,760
That's why he rushed and asked me,

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,310
to be his successor.

73
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,890
So,

74
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm going to look after his company.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,960
Thank you, Naoki!

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,720
But I'm the only one who knows,

77
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,260
that his real dream is,

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,630
to become a doctor.

79
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,120
He finally found his dream,

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,450
but does he have to give it up now?

Mischievious Kiss: Love in TOKYO

109
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,290
#13: A Mischief of Fate
Irie is working at his father's company?

110
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,310
Irie-kun told the school he's taking a temporary leave.

111
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,980
He'll be focusing on the company,

112
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,280
until Mr. Irie gets better.

113
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,800
I see.

114
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,840
It sounds very serious.

115
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,340
But

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,290
Irie will have no problem doing it.
-Yeah.

117
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,970
He's a genius after all!

118
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,820
That's right! I'm sure he was raised to

119
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,930
take over the company someday.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,670
And how's Mr. Irie?

121
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,340
Kotoko? Kotoko?

122
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,080
Oh, ah. He'll stay at the hospital for a while and take absolute rest.

123
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,600
Irie-kun will come back to live with us again.

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,270
I'm sure he's relieved.

125
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,820
I see.

126
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,830
But a time like this

127
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,250
the distance between you and Irie might come closer.

128
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,070
Huh?

129
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,000
You see, when you are sick or in the hospital,

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,970
because you feel weak,

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,450
it's easier to fall in love.

132
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,400
But it's Mr. Irie who's in the hospital.

133
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,750
But Irie is also anxious.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,500
If Irie-kun's feeling uneasy

135
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,190
and needs help,

136
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,480
if there's something I can do,

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,990
I would do anything.

138
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,010
Way to go, Kotoko.

139
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:40,560
But I don't want to think about the relationship between us right now.

140
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Because Mr. Irie's sick

141
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,860
and his company is in trouble.

142
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,630
I'm happy Irie-kun's coming back to the house, but....

143
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,220
if Mr. Irie get's better,

144
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,380
and

145
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,710
Irie-kun starts going to school again,

146
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,490
and studies what he wants to,

147
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,150
I'm okay with him living away from me.

148
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,920
Wow. I know that's not what you want.

149
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,220
No.

150
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,980
You said it.

151
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,860
That's what I expect from Kotoko.

152
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,200
Kin-chan. What do you mean "You said it", Kin-chan?

153
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,280
You simply don't want Kotoko and Irie to get closer.

154
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,850
Shut up!

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,600
This is no time to joke around.

156
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,290
His family has a big problem.

157
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,910
It's Irie.

158
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,170
I can see him pretending to be tough.

159
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,670
But I'm sure he feels

160
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,100
lonely and anxious.

161
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,030
Kotoko, if there's something that you can do,

162
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,050
you should do it.

163
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,350
You're right.

164
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,360
If there's something I can do,

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,740
I'll help you with it.

166
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,200
So don't hesitate and just ask anytime.

167
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,500
Thank you, Kin-chan.

168
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,390
It's about time. I have to go.

169
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,780
Goodbye.

170
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,660
-See you.
-Bye bye.

171
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,250
Hey, Kin-chan! What was that about?

172
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,070
What do you mean 'what'?

173
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,910
Could it be you gave up on Kotoko?

174
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,330
Are you stepping aside for Irie?

175
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,670
Don't be ridiculous!

176
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm not talking about something so low-leveled.

177
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,040
It's like I'm sending

178
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,730
support to my enemy.

179
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,430
Irie's family's in trouble.

180
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,080
If I take advantage of this situation

181
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,580
and take Kotoko from them,

182
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,950
it'd make me less of a man.

183
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,560
After all, you and Kotoko,

184
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,890
are so similar.

185
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,100
Because what you just said,

186
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,910
is the same as what Kotoko said.

187
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,040
'I don't care about myself, but I want the person I love to be happy'.

188
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,520
That's true! You're like her!

189
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,270
You and Kotoko are,

190
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,260
actually a good couple.

191
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,610
But...

192
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,720
Just kidding.
-What?

193
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,250
Kotoko can't love no one but Irie.
-Yeah.

194
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,320
What?

195
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,570
Never mind.

196
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,910
What?

197
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,690
What?

198
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,450
Please have some! Tonight we have stewed taro roots,

199
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,570
teriyaki yellowtail, miso soup,
kidney beans with sesame seeds,

200
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,740
and I guess you can call this boiled tofu.

201
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,660
It's hot. It's hot!

202
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,170
Too spicy?
-Yeah!

203
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,430
It can't be...

204
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,110
Why? Why's it? Why's it hot?

205
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,330
It's too spicy.

206
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,280
Naoki,

207
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,740
It's too spicy. You shouldn't eat it.

208
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,450
It's hot.

209
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,690
Naoki,

210
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,920
what was that sound?

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,230
The taro root.

212
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,110
Usually taro roots don't sound make that sound.

213
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,970
Undercooked!

214
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,710
Naoki, hurry and spit it out!

215
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,260
Don't force yourself to eat it. You shouldn't eat it.

216
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,440
Huh?
-Huh?

217
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,710
Stop complaining and eat your food, Yuki.

218
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,960
Ah, Irie-kun.

219
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,870
Do you want some coffee?

220
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,320
Yes.

221
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,980
Um, Irie-kun.

222
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,520
Are you going to take over the company?

223
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,810
You told me before you wanted to be a doctor.

224
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,540
I don't want to run away.

225
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,910
I told you,

226
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,760
I've been undergoing many trials since I met you.

227
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,970
I never imagined my father would collapse.

228
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,830
But,

229
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,080
I decided that I wouldn't run away.

230
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,630
Irie-kun.

231
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,610
When his heart recovers, I'll go back to school.

232
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,660
It's not too late to do what I want after that.

233
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,630
I don't think it's a bad idea to learn the ropes now.

234
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,480
I see.

235
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,610
If there's anything I can do, please let me know.

236
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,810
Oh yes, coffee.

237
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,180
During the time the president's in the hospital, I'll be your aid.

238
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,950
My name is Kanamori.

239
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,520
Please.

240
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,530
Now , let me explain the materials that I gave to you the other day.

241
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,350
You don't have to. I looked at them all last night.

242
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,130
You read all them by yourself?

243
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,830
Did the company's performance
decline significantly from last year?

244
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,380
Yes.

245
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,000
This is the inventory list of our most popular product.

246
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,150
Sales have dropped drastically.

247
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,360
Our rival company's similar product's taking our customers away.

248
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,270
The president was also concerned about this matter.

249
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,010
At this rate, Pandai may have to go through with a merger.

250
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,290
We immediately need
an enormous amount of financial support.

251
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,350
No wonder his heart became weak.

252
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,600
Okay.

253
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,190
Irie-kun's working hard.

254
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,860
I'm going to work hard making his lunches and doing house chores.

255
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,180
Alright!

256
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,620
It feels, kind of like we're a newlywed couple.

257
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,930
'Fight with love'.

258
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,160
H or G, which comes first?

259
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,090
Oh well, it's okay.

260
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,590
Heart, heart.

261
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,970
Love, love, heart.

262
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,380
G should come before H.

263
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,210
Welcome home!

264
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,520
Would you like to take a bath first, or do you want to eat first?

265
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,540
Oh, your jacket!

266
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,190
Breathe in, please.

267
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,690
Breathe out, please.

268
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,340
Hey, Irie-kun, Irie-kun.

269
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,250
Your brief case.

270
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,780
Have a good day. Good luck!

271
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,200
We are going to try to gain the profit from the copyrights strike of all the stokes.

272
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,810
For the production of the animation, we will have the self-motivation and acquire its copyrights.

273
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:49,810
Our unique business style's to take a partnership with overseas companies.

274
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,120
Do you know that too much miso makes the soup too salty?

275
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,720
So salty.

276
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,440
But today's taro roots are pretty good.

277
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,270
I'm sorry, Senpai.

278
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Request to temporarily leave the club
I see.

279
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,670
Irie's father's still not doing well?

280
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:35,770
No. That's why I can't spend much time at school.

281
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,580
Understood.

282
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,510
You and Irie are both precious tennis club members.

283
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,860
When Mr. Irie's better, you have to come back. We'll be waiting for you.

284
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,970
Thank you very much, Sudo-san senpai.

285
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,730
It is not only you, Aihara. We're all worried about Irie.

286
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,450
There are girls who miss him,

287
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,910
Like Matsumoto Ayako.
-Leader!

288
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm not coming to the practice today.

289
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,590
Huh? New members aren't allowed to miss a practice without permission!

290
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,280
That is why I'm here to tell you.

291
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,140
Today I have a date with my boyfriend, Taketo-kun.

292
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,350
BOYFRIEND?!

293
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,430
When did this happen?

294
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,640
I'm sorry. I'm going to borrow Ayako.

295
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
Kotoko-san, I heard about Naoki-san's father.

296
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,670
Please tell him I'm rooting for him. Goodbye.

297
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,270
Didn't she declare that she was going to win Irie's heart?

298
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,630
How'd she change so quickly?

299
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,100
Oh, she must be part of the new breed of Japanese kids. She must be.

300
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,690
What are you talking about?
-What?

301
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,210
Do you know 'Now Young'?

302
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,700
'Now Young'? You've totally lost me.

303
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,770
Oh, sorry, Kotoko-san.

304
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,950
Can we talk far a bit?

305
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,820
Um.. how is Irie-kun?

306
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,130
He is busy working at the company.

307
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,100
He usually comes home after midnight.

308
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,070
Well, I'm always up waiting for him.

309
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:29,910
So it means that there is a chance that he will quit school and run the company.

310
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,960
Well, he is just taking a leave from school for a little bit. He will come back eventually.

311
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,860
I wonder.

312
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,950
There is no need for him to go back to school,
if he is running his dad's company.

313
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,240
But...

314
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,280
When his heart is better, I will go back to school.

315
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,650
It won't be too late to do what I want.

316
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,950
I don't think it's bad to learn the ropes now.

317
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,120
Irie-kun,

318
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,000
wants to go back to school.

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,280
What I'm saying is that even if he want to go back to school, reality won't let him do that.

320
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,640
Oh!

321
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,510
Hey, why won't you liberate (let him free)
from your lunch boxes?

322
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,500
You are turning his lunch time into hell.

323
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,710
How did you know that I'm
making him lunch boxes?

324
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,910
I know you.

325
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,560
I'm pretty sure nothing happen between you two.

326
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,530
Um..well, no..well

327
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,840
Goodbye.

328
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,600
I'm home.

329
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,760
Ah! Welcome back!

330
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,550
Mom!

331
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,620
It's great to be at home.

332
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,200
There are visitors and checkups all day long.
It's so tiring.

333
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,020
What? He can have visitors now?

334
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,290
The doctor recommended for him to take it easy.

335
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,560
He only let co-workers/work related visit him.

336
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,130
I have good news.

337
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,230
I looks like he can come next month!

338
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,690
Really?

339
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,700
I'm so glad.

340
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,050
It depends on the results of the detailed exam.

341
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,920
But his condition is very stable. We will try to bring him home.

342
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,100
I think Daddy will be more relaxed
at home than at the hospital.

343
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,070
I'm sure.

344
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,590
We have caused you trouble a bit, Kotoko-chan.

345
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,130
No problem. You should watch out for yourself, Mrs. Irie.

346
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,610
Thank you [for your concern].

347
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,140
Now, I will get him clean clothes and head back to the hospital.

348
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,890
Yes!

349
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,190
-Yuki, be a good boy, okay?
-Okay.

350
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,940
This is good.

351
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,290
When Mr. Irie comes back from the hospital,
Irie-kun can return to school.

352
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,780
He will be able to study and
pursue his dream as a doctor.

353
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,190
Thanks to everyone's support,
he will be going home next month.

354
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,970
That's good to hear.

355
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,340
Well, Naoki-san is amazing. He has done very well taking his dad's place.

356
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,360
It's hard to believe he is still in college.

357
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,980
You are so dependable, Naoki!

358
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,420
Naoki-chan?

359
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:07,050
How strange. I don't think there is any visitor besides us today.

360
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,540
- I see. I see.
- Dad!

361
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,160
You should be resting.

362
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,840
Chairman Oizumi!

363
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,680
I was nearby and decided to stop by.

364
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:30,560
Naoki-san, this is Hokueisha's Chairman Oizumi and his secretary, Mr. Yokoyama.

365
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm sorry for not introducing myself sooner.

366
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,710
I am Irie Naoki.

367
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,250
Irie?

368
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,430
Oh, Chairman, I'm sorry for being rude.

369
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,140
This is my son, Naoki. He is currently getting trained at my company.

370
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,060
He seem like a very dependable young man.

371
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,450
Chairman, since everyone is here,
we should talk about the plan.

372
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,710
President Irie, we would like to discuss

373
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,740
in investing your company.

374
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,120
Yokoyama, we are in the hospital.

375
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,850
Oh, I'm sorry for being rude.

376
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,560
But I thought that his son and Mr. Kanamori
should listen to it, too.

377
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,370
Oh! Sure, of course.

378
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,450
Honey, can you hand me those papers over there?

379
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,130
But...

380
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,350
I hate to be rude, but I have to ask you to leave for today.

381
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,310
Naoki, Chairman Oizumi came all the way here to see me.

382
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,180
I'm sorry, but my dad needs to rest.

383
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,110
He is not in the condition to work.

384
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,900
Chairman.

385
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:40,000
In that case, we should reconsider the investment plan.

386
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,530
Chairman.

387
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:48,130
On my dad's behalf,
I would like to discuss the investment plan with you.

388
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,240
You have been very rude. A youngster like you - - -

389
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,620
Right now, I am the acting president!!

390
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,570
I would like to visit your company tomorrow.

391
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,450
So I would like to ask you to leave for today.

392
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,380
It's not good for my dad's health.

393
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,420
Hey, Naoki.

394
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,890
Please leave everything to me while you are still a patient.

395
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,080
I came to wish you a fast recovery, but it seems like I was being a nuisance.

396
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,500
Well then, please excuse us, Irie-kun.

397
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,220
You took your time to visit me, I'm sorry you have to leave.

398
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,190
Yokoyama, what is my schedule tomorrow?

399
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,280
Yes?

400
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,530
I'm asking you when will I be available tomorrow?

401
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,700
Well, before the lunch with the minister, you are available from 11am to noon.

402
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,500
So how is it? What do you say?

403
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,390
Thank you very much. I will be there tomorrow at 11 o' clock.

404
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,420
He made Chairman Oizumi make time for him.

405
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,650
Naoki-san is incredible.

406
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,110
Yes, he is.

407
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,460
This never happens.

408
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:34,610
For these reasons, I can promise
you will have enough profit for your company.

409
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,700
What do you think, Yokoyama?

410
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,000
For a student who has no experience,
but learned management from lectures,

411
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,590
the presentation was well done.

412
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,420
Excuse me, but I am in the science and engineering department.

413
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,190
I taught myself management.

414
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:02,250
I see. But you aren't planning on becoming a successor of Pandai?

415
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,140
Why are you in the science
and engineeing department?

416
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,940
It's because I wanted to have a broad and diverse range of knowledge.

417
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:15,690
I don't think a person with a narrow range of knowledge
can survive in this world.

418
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,080
Excuse me.

419
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,350
Are you alright?

420
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,450
Yes.

421
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,820
Please be careful.

422
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,270
Naoki, I know you're busy. I'm sorry for calling you to leave work.

423
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,390
More importantly,
you said there is something urgent to tell me?

424
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,560
It's because I didn't want Yuki to hear this.

425
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,940
Welcome back! You are late again.,
I will heat up dinner right away

426
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,080
You are late again.
I will heat up dinner right away.

427
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,050
You don't need to.

428
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,290
Did you have dinner already?

429
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,710
I don't have appetite.

430
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,440
Irie-kun

431
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,420
here, a bento

432
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,970
Oh, thanks.

433
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,380
Um, you seem a little tired.

434
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,430
Are you okay?

435
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,500
Irie-kun?

436
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,060
I was just thinking to myself.

437
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,390
I'm leaving now.

438
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,920
Take care.

439
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,920
Naoki...

440
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,220
I wonder if he's alright.

441
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,060
Here.

442
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,220
It looks delicious!

443
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,740
Of course, our Boss made it.

444
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,700
'Cause he thought it must be a pain cooking every day.

445
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,890
Thank you.

446
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,840
That was thoughtful.

447
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,780
You should thank our Boss instead.

448
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,540
Um, Kotoko...

449
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,230
So you're not going to university now, huh?

450
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,520
No.

451
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,720
Well, is that okay?

452
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,810
I was the one that decided to go to university, so I want to study really hard until I graduate, but...

453
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,110
Now, I just want to be of service to the Irie family.

454
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,620
You said, Irie family?

455
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,290
I-ri-e, yeah?

456
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,620
I...

457
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,960
know you.

458
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,240
Well, there's also somethings I should not know, though.

459
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,580
Kin-chan

460
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,480
Well, if there's something you want to do,

461
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,410
I'll be your supporter.

462
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,990
Don't keep things to yourself.
Tell me if you need my help.

463
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,740
Not just cooking, problems with class, anything!

464
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,750
Thank you, Kin-chan

465
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,590
But um...

466
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,100
I can't write a report for you.

467
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,770
Because if I did that sort of thing, You'd...

468
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,920
become a dropout.

469
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,560
Oh come on...

470
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,470
Isn't today's dinner delicious?

471
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,260
This was probably made by Kototo's dad.

472
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,140
You caught me.

473
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,330
How could you think that you won't get caught?

474
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,030
The skill levels are way too different.

475
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,150
Excuse me, I did try my best at least.

476
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,700
Can't you just appreciate my work once?

477
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,940
Thank you.

478
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,920
You're always full of whiny comments.

479
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,560
What?

480
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,140
You've gotten better.

481
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,170
Thank you for the meal.

482
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,280
Irie-kun is late, now.

483
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,590
Irie-kun!

484
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:44,260
Oh, it's just Sudo-san.

485
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,350
Hello.

486
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,590
Oh, Aihara.

487
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,060
There is a big problem.

488
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,480
What happened?

489
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,480
I want to tell Matsumoto that I like her...

490
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,680
What?

491
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,180
Did you finally tell her the truth?

492
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,310
No,

493
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,890
I was just about to.

494
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,000
Oh, is that so?

495
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,200
Please don't call me just to tell me about an insignificant thing.

496
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,400
No, no, no, after that she said,

497
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,890
she has already loved someone else.

498
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,840
I'm know that she would say that.

499
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,500
We all knew that she likes Irie-kun,

500
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,710
so I thought you already knew about that.

501
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,170
No, that's not what I meant.
I do know that she loves him.

502
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,880
She said she that was going

503
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,570
to confess her love to Irie.

504
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:34,560
Of course if she loves someone, she have to confess her feeling for him.

505
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,340
What?

506
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,660
Matsumoto-san is going to confess her loves to Irie-kun?

507
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,880
When... when will she do it?

508
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,890
Tonight.

509
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,270
Tonight?

510
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,730
Where and when is Matsumoto-san will confess to Irie-kun?

511
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,310
Don't tell me that she told him already?

512
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,630
No!!!

513
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:54,250
I'm sorry for waiting for you at this place.

514
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,430
You must have been waiting here for a long time.

515
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:00,020
If you wanted to tell me something,
you could have gone to my house instead.

516
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,220
I didn't want to do so.

517
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,020
I just wanted to only tell you.

518
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,570
You're in a difficult situation, right now,

519
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,730
and I know I'm being selfish.

520
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,720
Even so . . .

521
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,140
What is it?

522
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:30,190
I think I love you, Irie-kun.

523
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,680
You see?

524
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,990
I said it to you straight.

525
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,390
So,

526
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:44,110
I also want you to tell me straight about your feeling too.

527
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,110
What do you think about me?

528
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,360
Sorry.

529
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:11,310
I only think of you as a friend.

530
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,280
I really love you, Irie-kun.

531
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,110
I've never felt this way before.

532
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,510
So...

533
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,330
I can't give up like this.

534
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,910
Are you satisfied now?

535
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:01,700
I'm sorry,
but I can't think of doing something like that with you.

536
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,610
Why you don't want to do it with me?

537
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,340
Then,

538
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,950
who would you kiss?

539
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,390
I've kissed someone.

540
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,010
I've kissed Kotoko.

541
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,680
I feel insulted by this.

542
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,770
My pride is torn apart.

543
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:53,170
But, I hope that your father will get better soon.

544
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:07,240
But that kiss... was happened more than a year ago.

545
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,110
Why would he say it now?

546
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,880
Hey.

547
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,720
Stop spying on my love life.

548
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,040
Sorry.

549
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,050
I was just worried about you because you were late.

550
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,400
Irie-kun?

551
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,540
My father is really not doing well.

552
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,090
What?

553
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,330
Today,

554
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,580
I went to ask the doctor with my mom.

555
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,300
It looks like his condition kinda stable now.

556
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,060
However, the result of the detailed exam was,

557
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,400
they found it only in his heart.

558
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,200
When they're ready,

559
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,010
he's going to have the surgery.

560
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,630
Is the surgery going to be difficult?

561
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,860
It's his heart.

562
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,320
Even if the surgery is successful,

563
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,740
he still can't go to work for a while.

564
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,650
I see.

565
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,890
I think the disease is caused by stress and concern.

566
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,490
Because of the depression,

567
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,750
the company has gotten worse.

568
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,770
That's why,

569
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,930
he wanted me to take over his company whenever possible.

570
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,630
I've thought of you as my,

571
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,120
company's official successor.

572
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,930
At this time, Pandai might need to go through with a merger.

573
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,150
If I would take over the company,

574
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,120
all of the issues will be solved.

575
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,820
But, isn't your dream is to become a doctor?

576
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,620
Yeah, It's not that long yet since I had that dream.

577
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,550
I...

578
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,740
wanted to become a doctor.

579
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,970
But, I'm not sure if it would suit me,

580
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,900
but I want to study properly.

581
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,110
So you will give up your dream?

582
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,610
Irie-kun.

583
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
For me, to be a doctor,

584
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,150
was the first job that interested me since I was born.

585
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,990
Irie-kun, today felt depressed.

586
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:45,530
Before I knew it, I was hugging Irie-kun.

587
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,300
But,

588
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,510
he didn't refuse my hands.

589
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,340
At this time,

590
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,600
I felt like my heart and Irie-kun's hearts are connecting.

591
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,070
Irie-kun,

592
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,570
here is your lunch box.

593
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,180
I'm confident with the rolled egg, today.

594
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,180
I've heard that leeks makes you getting smarter.

595
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,230
I've heard that leek makes you getting smarter.

596
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,180
In that case, you should eat it yourself.

597
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,760
Have a nice day!

598
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,400
In spite of that.

599
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:55,110
I'm so glad that you came to visit our company today, Chairman.

600
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,870
- Thank you for coming.
- Well, well...

601
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,880
It because I had affairs to take care of in this area.

602
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,030
Are you here by yourself?

603
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,290
I came here to discuss with you the personal matter, Naoki-kun.

604
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,370
Discuss with me?

605
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,520
Naoki-kun,

606
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,450
would you like to have an arranged marriage meeting?

607
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,310
I know it's not the best time for you since your father is still in the hospital, right now.

608
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,350
But I have a granddaughter.

609
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,450
She is the same age as you,

610
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,320
she also goes to Seishin Women's College.

611
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,130
That is a real prominent school.

612
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,700
What do you think, Naoki-kun?

613
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,600
Would you at least meet her once?

614
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,500
You're still young.

615
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,930
I'm sure that you need more time to consider.

616
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,630
After discussing it with your parents,

617
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,860
please tell me your answer as soon as possible.

618
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,660
We will talk about it again,

619
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,160
in the next investment plan.

620
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,220
I'm sorry for visiting without any notice.

621
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,520
Please don't apologize.

622
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,040
Well, Naoki-kun.

623
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,210
Please think about this carefully.

624
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,330
Okay.

625
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,900
Thank you very much.

626
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,010
Naoki-san.

627
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,240
This meeting will,

628
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,510
be a perfect chance for our company, right?

629
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,380
Our fate is about to,

630
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,120
grow more special.

631
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,700
♫ My overgrown bangs are ♫

632
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,690
♫ gently shaken by the wind ♫

633
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,230
♫ It's still slightly chilly ♫

634
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,580
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

635
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,220
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

636
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,520
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

637
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,630
♫ I realized many things ♫

638
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,100
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

639
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,130
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

640

651
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,030
You're really having an arranged marriage meeting?

652
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,740
Right, I like her.

653
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,250
Do you remember me?

654
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,080
I would never forget such a beautiful woman.

655
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,000
I have a perfect idea.
How about you go and ruin the meeting?

656
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,210
For the first time, I would like to join your plan.

657
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,960
This is not like what you though.

658
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,360
An arranged meeting is between parents.

659
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,820
I will take away Kotoko from you.

660
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,290
Just do whatever you want.

661
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,900
The person that you love is,

662
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,280
Kotoko, right, brother?

663
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,220
But I'm sure that everything will work out well.
