1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,170
Um, I would like to go to the party . . .

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,010
But you can't, can you?

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,370
I hear you're going to spend Christmas Eve with your friends.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,810
Let's have a wonderful night together!

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,570
Today there is someone that I want to introduce you to.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,780
Boyfriends?

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,190
When did this happen to both of you?

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,890
In the end, I've been betrayed...

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,240
If I knew this was going to happen,
I would have gone to Mr. Irie's party.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,150
Even in this neighborhood,
some thieves have been breaking into houses.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,860
Thief!

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,550
You, you, you!

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,390
What are you doing?

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,310
I thought you were having a party with your friends?

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,950
We have one.

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,660
What?

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,850
A cake.

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,930
Although it was a coincidence...

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,460
I could spend my first real Christmas with Irie-kun.

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,280
It was like a dream.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,320
Just wait, Kotoko. I am bringing you delicious food.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,950
It's really Christmas now.

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,080
Why is it so dark?

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:29,940
I spent Christmas Eve with Irie-kun alone.
I really enjoyed the night.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm quite sure it was only a special little treat.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,990
The relationship between Irie-kun and I
haven't changed at all.

27
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,090
And the season has changed...

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,950
Now it's spring time again
and the new school year is starting.

29
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,180
We were all able to advance to the second year of college.

30
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,910
Tonan University is welcoming the new students.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
Um,

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,070
I'm the 54th tennis club leader,

33

the new students...

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,860
I would like to have

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,330
a word from you.

38
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,800
Please go ahead.

39
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,360
I am a new Tonan University student majoring in law.

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,090
My name is Matsumoto Ayako.

41
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,190
I was the champion of last year's

42
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,910
national tournament for women.

43
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,600
My goal in college is to win the championship at the national tournament.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,450
And...

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,420
To win Naoki-san's heart!

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,240
Pleased to meet you.

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,910
What?

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,970
What do you teach your little sister?

49
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,460
That's what I want to ask!

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,090
Well, we've got one unnecessary new student.

51
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,330
We are now second year students.

52
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,340
It feels so weird to be called "senior".

53
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,400
I know. But I still feel like I'm a new student.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,110
By the way, what are you reading so enthusiastically, Satomi?

55
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,420
Oh, well...

56
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,180
Starting tomorrow, I'll be working part-time at this magazine's editorial office.

57
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,170
What?

58
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,890
Well, we should all start thinking about jobs for after we graduate, right?

59
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,500
I've always wanted to work at an editorial office for a women's magazine.

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,440
I've approached them so many times. And finally they accepted me.

61
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,420
Amazing! You are amazing, Satomi!

62
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,550
Although all I'm going to do in the beginning is serve tea and various chores.

63
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,760
But I feel like I'm at the starting line at last.

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,620
I'll try my best.

65
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,790
Kotoko, what are you doing for your future prospects?

66
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,340
Could it be... that you will marry into Irie's family when you graduate?

67
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,200
-No way! -Great!

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,800
But, I have never thought about a job.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,710
You better think about it

70
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,190
and start doing something now.

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,000
She's right.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,710
You are too relaxed.

73
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,580
Next year, we are all going to start looking for a job.

74
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,860
We need to start researching and doing something.

75
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,000
I want to work for a recording company or music production.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,450
Really? Is that because of Narasaki-kun?

77
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,970
Well, in the beginning I just wanted to support him.

78
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,810
But I've gained more interest in the indie music scene.

79
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,480
I want to get a job where I can discover a band that will be recognized internationally.

80
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,490
I see.

81

What is my dream for the future?

That's not what we are talking about.

83
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,690
So easy to tell.

84

I didn't realize that everyone was already
moving toward their dreams.

We want to have a party to celebrate you and Naoki advancing to the next year.

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,530
So Irie-kun will come home for the party?

108
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,880
Of course.

-What?

The new school year has started...

115
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,560
and there is a new rival

116

She is a little bit cute.

And she might be better at playing tennis than her big sister.

Unlike you who will always love Naoki no matter what happens...

she doesn't have the indomitable spirit that you have.

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,390
Successor, huh? You know how terrible Kotoko's cooking is.

163
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,890
I am thinking it's okay to end this restaurant

164
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,230
when I'm done.

165
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:22,050
And yet, you made this into a wonderful restaurant.

166
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,370
Well, It's my fate for having an incapable daughter.

167
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,700
I can't help but to give it up.

168
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,900
But it's possible to have her husband

169
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,800
take over this place.

170
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,220
Frankly the boy named Kinnosuke

171
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,130
has liked Kotoko-chan since high school, right?

172
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,530
This is just between us.

173
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,990
It's true, he has a really good skill.

174
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,390
It's possible that he will become an excellent chef

175
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,470
and keep this restaurant going.

176
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,940
Then why don't you...?

177
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,180
But that's only up to Kotoko...

178
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,330
I'm like you, Iri-chan.

179
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,770
I've always done what I wanted.

180
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,120
I can't tell my daughter to marry someone

181
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,200
that I choose so that I can keep my restaurant.

182
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,270
I know Kotoko's not perfect...

183
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,430
But I'm hoping...

184
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,720
that someone she loves will marry her.

185
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,590
You're right.

186
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,780
Excuse me, excuse me.

187
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,250
Oh, I'm sorry.

188
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,420
Kinnosuke?

189
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,050
What's wrong?

190
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,070
You're not feeling well?

191
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,810
I'm going to throw the garbage out.

192
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,230
Huh?

193
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,880
Well, well...

194
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,950
It's not like you, Kinnosuke.

195
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,570
What's wrong with you?

196
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,290
Why am I so depressed?

197
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,590
-Boss
-Thanks.

198
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,900
Oh, here it is.

199
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,930
So do you think I've been egoistic

200
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,640
for hoping my son will take over my company?

201
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,730
Are you talking about Naoki-kun?

202
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,060
Yeah, he is not happy about it.

203
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,610
But even thought Naoki-kun doesn't want to, you still have Yuki-kun.

204
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,470
You have two great sons.

205
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,420
I only have Kotoko. Your situation is different from mine.

206
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,140
So don't worry.

207
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,230
It will be too late

208
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,380
if we wait for Yuki to grow up.

209
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,030
What?

210
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,350
Satomi's really late. We're about to start.

211
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,580
It's time already.

212
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,080
-There she is.
-Good morning!

213
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
You barely made it.

214
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,710
I was working late last night.

215
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,670
I didn't get any sleep.

216
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,510
-You stayed up all night?
- Are you okay?

217
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,100
I'm totally fine!

218
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,240
I was up the night before turning
the manuscripts in to the publisher.

219
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,180
Everyone was giving it their all.

220
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,310
The more everyone worked,
the better the articles got.

221
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,110
Even an unprofessional
person like me could tell.

222
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,630
Magazines are like live creatures.
Just being there made me so excited.

223
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,830
I really enjoy doing the job.

224
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,570
I totally understand how it feels.

225
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,890
I love you, Jinko.

226
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,190
That's what society is about.

227
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,050
Right, I'm fine without sleep.

228
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,740
Me too. I was fine.

229
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,140
-So you know how excited I am?
-I do!

230
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,480
-I'm so tired.
-Me too.
-I'm hungry.

231
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,270
What are you doing for lunch today?
Do you want to go to cafeteria?

232
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,240
Sorry, I have to go.
I'm working this afternoon.

233
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,910
Me too. I'm having lunch with a girl who works at a music company.

234
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,250
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry!

235
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,960
I see.
Well, next time then!

236
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,710
-See you tomorrow!
-Bye, bye!

237
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:21,110
See you! Bye bye!

238
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,310
Bye bye!

239
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,640
Kin-chan.

240
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,470
Can you try this?

241
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,780
Sure, but what is it?

242
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,090
I might be

243
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,710
able to have my dish on the menu at Aihara.

244
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,180
That's why...

245
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,630
Your dish will be served at the restaurant?

246
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,990
Amazing!

247
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,060
Just one dish.

248
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,740
And on top of that, it's only a dish that
comes before your drink

249
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,380
And moreover, It will only happen

250
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,970
if Boss tries it and gives the okay.

251
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,600
It will take years for someone like me...

252
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,350
to have his own full course meal at a restaurant.

253
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,390
But this is great!

254
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,500
Tell me that after you taste it.

255
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,400
Well then, I will have some.

256
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,930
Let see...

257
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,220
No good?

258
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,410
Did I put a wrong ingredient?

259
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,950
Not that, it's really good.

260
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,670
You were good at cooking,
even when you were in high school.

261
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,970
But this is completely different from then.
This tastes very professional.

262
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,160
Are you telling the truth?

263
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
But then why did you make that unsatisfied face?

264
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,510
I just thought...

265
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,340
that everyone was doing amazingly.

266
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,830
I've always wanted to work at

267
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,470
an editorial office for a women's magazine.

268
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,620
Magazines are like

269
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,380
live creatures.

270
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,940
Just being there made me so excited.

271
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,590
I really enjoy doing the job.

272
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,810
I want to work for

273
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,910
a recording company or a music production,

274
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,730
and I've gained more interest in the indie music scene.

275
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I want to get a job where I can discover a
band that will be recognized internationally.

276
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,670
You, Jinko and Satomi have found what you want to do and are taking steps toward your dreams.

277
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,210
But I thought about how only I haven't found anything
that I want to do.

278
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:13,070
Everyone has their own pace.

279
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,410
You just have to find something

280
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,410
at your own pace, you see?

281
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,990
Hey, how did you feel when you decided to become a chef?

282
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,310
How did you know that was what you wanted to do?

283
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Hmm, how did I know...

284
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,720
No, this is not something

285
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,490
that you need to think of.

286
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,950
Just like falling in love with someone...

287
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,090
"Like falling in love with someone?"

288
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,800
Right.

289
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,030
When you fall in love with someone,

290
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,260
you don't need to think about why. You just know it.

291
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,470
Like, "Oh, I love this person."

292
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,010
It's the same.

293
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,930
You don't need to think about anything difficult.

294
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,780
You get excited and enjoy being with him.

295
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,990
You want to stay together forever.

296
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,290
It's like that. You just realize

297
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,920
that you've been doing it all along.

298
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,090
Oh, I see.

299
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,210
But the job

300
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,600
that allows you to stay with someone you love...

301
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,220
and the job that you love are different.

302
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,340
What?

303
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,510
For example...

304
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,290
If the person I love was the president of a company...

305
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,580
I want to be his secretary.

306
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,120
If the person I love was a pilot...

307
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,060
I want to be...

308
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,400
a flight attendant.

309
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,800
If he was a tennis player...

310
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I want to be his manager that takes care of his schedule.

311
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,700
If he was a university professor...

312
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,100
[Call Me]

313
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,300
I want to become his assistant

314
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,100
and help with his research.

315
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,000
I dream about what I want to be in the future.

316
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,300
But there is a problem in those dreams.

317
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,000
Depending on what the person I love wants to do...

318
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,100
what I want to do keeps changing.

319
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,500
That's not what I really want to do, is it?

320
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,730
I can't call it my life's dream.

321
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,100
Kin-chan?

322
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,000
Then,

323
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,500
if the person you love was a chef...

324
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,300
you would be the female owner of the restaurant, right?

325
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,100
It's great to live to support someone else's dream.

326
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,600
A man wants to make

327
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,800
a woman like that happy.

328
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,600
I think you will be a great restaurant owner.

329
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,900
Oh, stop joking around, Kin-chan.

330
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,800
Can I have more?

331
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,600
Here they are.

332
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,300
Job Searching Support Section.

333
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,000
"Just like falling in love with someone, you just know it." huh?

334
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,900
Although he said so, I feel pressured.

335
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,300
I wonder what kind of book Irie-kun is reading...

336
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I wanted to live on my own

337
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,600
to find out what I wanted to do in life.

338
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,500
If I graduated from college;

339
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,300
kept living at home like I used to . . .

340
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,900
and took over my father's company . . .

341
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,700
I wondered if that was what I wanted.

342
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,730
I would just be following the path
that my parents made for me.

343
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,800
I feel like

344
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,300
I'm the only one left behind.

345
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,900
Irie-kun.

346
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,900
You're actually studying? That's pretty odd.

347
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,700
Are you preparing for the second language class?

348
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,900
Isn't this for medicinal studies?

349
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,600
Why are you looking at this?

350
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,100
Naoki and Kotoko-chan.

351
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,900
Congrats on beginning your second year of college!

352
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,400
Cheers!

353
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
Thank you.

354
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,650
Thank you so much! This really is wonderful.

355
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,230
Oh, it's nothing.

356
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,000
Yuki's now 5th grade as well.

357
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,500
The time to study for middle school is coming!

358
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,100
Work hard!

359
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm going to go to the same school as my brother!

360
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,200
I'll definitely be in Class A

361
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,900
and become the best in the school!

362
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,100
The boy's got some guts, huh, Iri-chan?

363
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,700
Well, shall we eat? Let's eat, let's eat.

364
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Yes, thank you for the food!

365
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
This is Mom's special, "Sushi Balls."

366
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,300
Dig in.

367
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,100
The shape of the daikon radishes are very pretty.

368
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,800
I feel so flattered by a compliment from a professional chef.

369
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,100
Naoki and Yuki, eat a lot, okay?

370
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,900
Here you go.

371
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
This is especially good.

372
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,200
Eat this, okay?

373
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
And this, and this...

374
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,600
I can't eat that much at once.

375
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,100
Because I'm so worried if you are getting enough vitamins and calcium.

376
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,800
Eat more.

377
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,900
Oh, dear, Naoki's not a child anymore.

378
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,700
Here, have some champagne.

379
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,600
Oh, thank you, honey!

380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,000
Bottoms up!

381
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,600
I think your mother is happy because you are here.

382
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,060
Yuki, have some more.

383
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,900
I'm stuffed...

384
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,400
You will get fat if you eat that much, Kotoko.

385
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,600
You were eating a lot, too.

386
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm okay.

387
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
I'm gonna get taller,

388
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
but your chest won't get any bigger.

389
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,000
She's trying to kill me.

390
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,700
It's so nice to get all the family members together.

391
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,000
Home is the best!

392
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,300
I feel bad for being included in your family.

393
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,500
What are you talking about?

394
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
-You are like one of our family members.
-She's right.

395
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,900
I haven't given up on Naoki and Kotoko-chan, okay?

396
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,800
Hey Naoki,

397
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,200
are you planning to keep living by yourself?

398
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,400
Didn't you enjoy enough?

399
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,900
Maybe you should come back home.

400
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,600
She's right, Naoki.

401
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,700
Right? And then,

402
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,300
Kotoko-chan and Naoki can get married

403
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,500
and we can become a real family!

404
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,600
You're completely drunk.

405
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,000
You had too much.

406
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,200
I'm not drunk.

407
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,000
Right, Kotoko-chan?

408
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I think that it's a bit early for marriage...

409
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,900
Why are you saying that?

410
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
When we got married,

411
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,000
we were 19 years old, just like you!

412
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,500
It's not even that early!

413
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,940
Thanks for the food.

414
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,700
I'll be heading home.

415
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,900
Aww...

416
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,100
That's right.

417
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
To Naoki, my existence

418
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,300
is just a nuisance.

419
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,900
Naoki, wait a minute.

420
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I have something to tell you.

421
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,600
Can you come to my study?

422
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
Please.

423
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,030
Can you come too, Dear?

424
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,580
This is something I want you to hear.

425
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,200
Oh...

426
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,350
Excuse us for a little bit.

428
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,580
But please

429
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,400
have some tea.

430
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm sorry. Good bye!

431
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,570
What is it?

432
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,960
Naoki, what are your thoughts about your future?

433
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,860
I want you to tell me what you are really thinking.

434
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,390
I'm sure you already know this.

435
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,930
I've been thinking seriously about your role in my company.

436
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:13,420
After you graduate,
I think it'd be better for you to enter into the company.

437
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm in favor of that idea.

438
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,220
You're still just a sophomore, but...

439
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,690
there's no such thing as preparing too early for work.

440
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,170
So, for example...

441
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:30,490
By using the long holidays like a summer vacation...

442
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,340
I'm thinking you could learn about the company.

443
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,880
I also want to hear your opinion about the company's management.

444
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,970
Why are they taking so long?

445
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,610
I wonder what they're talking about.

446
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,780
Why don't you bring them some tea, Kotoko?

447
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,940
Sure, I'll do that.

448
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,400
What do you think, Naoki?

449
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,210
I can't decide whether I will

450
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,120
take over your company or not right now.

451
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,960
I need more time to think about it.

452
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,980
You've had enough time to think about it.

453
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,930
About your father's company...

454
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,940
and about Kotoko-chan!

455
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,110
Let's not talk about Kotoko-chan now.

456
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:51,370
No. This is also important for his future.

457
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:57,460
I didn't choose Kotoko-chan randomly for you to be with.

458
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,900
If you take over your father's company...

459
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,880
I think Kotoko-chan would be your ideal wife. Right?

460
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,180
It certainly requires

461
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,560
a tremendous amount of work

462
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,350
to manage a company.

463
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,760
You definitely need your family's support.

464
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,730
You need someone who would care about you... would support you...

465
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,800
and would be loved by the people around you.

466
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,320
You shouldn't just marry someone because you love her.

467
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,060
In that sense, I also think Kotoko-chan is your ideal wife.

468
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:46,030
But the most important thing here is how you feel.

469
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,610
Tell me what's going through your mind.

470
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,100
What do you think, Naoki?

471
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,650
What do I think?

472
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:00,330
You and Mom are just doing things the way you want.

473
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,690
It looks like you've been making my choices for me

474
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:13,270
and planning out every detail of my life

475
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,310
from the very beginning.

476
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,860
That's dirty.

477
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,360
D-dirty...

478
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,470
Naoki! Just what are you saying to your father?

479
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,600
He's doing this out of concern for you–

480
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,280
He's not concerned about me, he's concerned about himself.

481
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,770
How could you...

482
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,490
You're the same!

483
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,640
Going on and on about Kotoko without thinking about my feelings,

484
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,710
you try to make us a couple.

485
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,390
That... I explained it to you earlier.

486
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,640
There is a reason why I think

487
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,620
she is good for you.

488
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,180
And I think you and her make a great couple.

489
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,650
That's enough.

490
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,900
Not only my job,

491
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,890
but I can't even choose whom I love.

492
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,640
And that's why I left

493
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,090
this prison of a house!

494
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,450
Honey!

495
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,240
Calm down, please.

496
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,150
I'm sorry, I was just–

497
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,520
Irie-kun!

498
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,250
Irie-kun!!

499
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,770
Kotoko,

500
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,550
what's wrong with my big brother?

501
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,530
What in the world happened?

502
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,640
Nothing, nothing...

503
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,850
It's his coat. I'm going to bring it to him.

504
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,350
Irie-kun. You left your coat.

505
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,250
Oh.

506
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,910
Irie-kun.
The station is not that way.

507
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,340
I'm just taking a walk.

508
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,370
I'm sorry about earlier.

509
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,550
That you had to see our ugly family quarrel.

510
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,350
No,

511
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,380
I feel like I was eavesdropping on you.

512
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,320
I'm sorry.

513
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:28,830
But I think your mother just lost her temper.

514
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,700
You see, you usually don't say much.

515
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,420
You don't tell others

516
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,310
what you are thinking.

517
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,990
That's why they were uneasy.

518
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,740
Because they didn't know what you really wanted...

519
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,270
they were frustrated

520
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,410
and nervous.

521
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,810
So even though that happened . . .

522
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,880
both of your parents

523
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,870
care about you the most.

524
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,690
I know that for a fact.

525
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,850
But I also get how you feel too, Irie-kun.

526
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,080
You only have one life.

527
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,990
I'm sure you want to decide what to do with your own life.

528
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,920
That's right.

529
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,430
That's totally true.

530
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,010
You told me once...

531
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,970
that you go to college to find out what you want to do with your life.

532
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,440
Yeah.

533
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,000
Have you found one?

534
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,140
Sad to say, I haven't.

535
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:12,360
Not only Kin-chan... but Jinko and Satomi already started toward their careers.

536
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,200
But I'm way behind them.

537
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:23,510
I'm always thinking about nothing but Irie-kun.

538
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,470
I feel so miserable.

539
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,520
Kin-chan said to me...

540
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,860
"When you find something that you want to do,

541
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,500
you will know without thinking."

542
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,850
He also said that it's like falling in love with someone.

543
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:19,120
But, you would be so nervous until you find one.

544
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,680
You're right.

545
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,800
That's why I think you are amazing.

546
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:35,240
If my father told me to take over
his restaurant like you father did...

547
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,880
I would just go with the flow.

548
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,930
But you didn't just obey your father.

549
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,920
So...

550
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,160
So...

551
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,140
not only about your job...

552
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,070
but about whom you love...

553
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,870
Not only my job,

554
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:09,340
but I can't even choose whom I love.

555
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,560
You shouldn't just go with what your parents say.

556
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,040
You should choose whom you love.

557
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,780
That's what is best for you.

558
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,730
There is no reason to love someone.

559
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,510
Even if everyone around you tells you what to do...

560
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,700
you can't be with the person if you don't like her.

561
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:47,350
Irie-kun, you should find someone that you really love and be happy...

562
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,130
I...

563
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,830
want to be a doctor.

564
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,390
Huh?

565
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,970
I'm thinking of taking the next exam to transfer
to the medical department.

566
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,090
I'm not sure if I'm suited for it.

567
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,440
But I want to study it properly.

568
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,840
People's live are dependent
on split second decisions.

569
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,740
Something very small could make
a curable illness incurable.

570
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,570
I was scared, too.

571
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:31,970
Until then, I'd thought our lives
were decided by God...

572
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,570
and there was nothing we could do.

573
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,570
Being a doctor is the first thing I've been interested in since I was born.

574
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,670
Why didn't you tell that to your dad?

575
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,740
Until a little while ago, I wasn't sure about it.

576
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,650
"A little while ago?"

577
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,250
Then when did you decide...?

578
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,560
When we were taking a walk. I think.

579
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,110
But I still don't want to tell Father and Mother.

580
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,120
Why not?

581
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,100
I'm going to properly prepare

582
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,230
and wait until I'm ready to take some concrete actions.

583
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,800
So until then, you can't tell anyone, either.

584
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,890
Sure.

585
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,740
Sure.

586
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:46,630
But why did you tell me such an important thing?

587
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,430
Well...

588
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,480
I'm not sure why.

589
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,110
The station?

590
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,830
W-why?

591
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,140
But we went in a different direction.

592
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,630
I think it means that there are...

593
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,920
many ways to get to one destination.

594
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,800
It seemed like you were making a detour...

595
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,330
but you might find something important.

596
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,350
Bye, Kotoko.

597
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,270
Irie-kun.

598
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,380
Why did he reveal such an important thing

599
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,760
only to me?

600
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,830
But I feel like you can, Irie-kun.

601
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,350
You can invent new medicines...

602
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:07,200
You can become a doctor and
cure a disease in an instant.

603
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,060
I'm the worst mother ever!

604
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,710
We are a family after all.

605
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,780
It's okay to clash once in a while.

606
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,620
But still...

607
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,440
Honey...

608
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,120
Honey, I need to tell you something important...

609
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,500
What is it?

610
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,360
I really wanted to say this while Naoki was still here, but...

611
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,200
The truth is...

612
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,660
Dear?

613
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,190
Honey! Honey, are you okay?

614
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,990
Naoki! Naoki!

615
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,560
Honey, are you okay? Hang in there.

616
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,040
Honey!

617
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,220
Iri-chan. What's wrong?

618
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,290
Daddy!

619
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,000
Hang in there.

620
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,450
Honey! Honey!

621
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,900
Iri-chan.

622
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,760
Hang on.

623
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,580
-What should we do?
-Honey!

624
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,810
♫ My overgrown bangs are ♫

625
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,800
♫ gently shaken by the wind ♫

626
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,300
♫ It's still slightly chilly ♫

627
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,510
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

628
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:55,240
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

629
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:00,610
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

630
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,520
♫ I realized many things ♫

631
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:09,090
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

632
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,960
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

633
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:17,330
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

634

♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

♫ your smile, and today ♫

642
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,250

643
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:03,620
♫  I always want to walk by your side ♫

644
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,900
I'm the acting president right now.

645
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,560
What is going to happen to Dad's company?

646
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,190
I'll save his company.

647
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,740
I would like to discuss the investment to your company...

648
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,520
At this rate, the company might get merged.

649
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,170
I feel like we are a newlywed couple.

650
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:40,240
At a time like this, the distance between
Irie and Kotoko's heart could become closer.

651
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,660
Matsumoto-san wil confess
her love to Irie-kun?

652
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,830
No!

653
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,990
Could it be that you gave up on Kotoko?

654
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,400
No way.

655
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,900
Naoki-kun, would you like to have
an arranged marriage meeting?

656
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,630
It's better for the company, isn't it?

657
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,790
If I become the president
every problem will be solved.

658
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,230
So are you giving up

659
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,030
your dream to become a doctor?
