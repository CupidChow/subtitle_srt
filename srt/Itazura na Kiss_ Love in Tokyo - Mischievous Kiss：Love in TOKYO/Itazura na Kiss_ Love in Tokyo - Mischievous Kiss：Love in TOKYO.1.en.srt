1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,510
Kiss in Tokyo

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Welcome to tonight's "Kiss in Tokyo".

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,950
I, Tama, will host the show.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,140
Please relax and enjoy the show for the next four hours.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,050
In fact, I went to see a fortune-teller recently.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,650
She told me there's a possibility of falling in love,

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,050
but that I'd lose the opportunity because I always close my heart.

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,650
This can't be true.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,040
What I need is courage to tell him about my feelings.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,830
It's true that you need courage for that.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,710
Have you ever done such a thing before?

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,520
So tonight, I'd like to hear your stories.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,950
Hey you, now's not the time for yawning.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,400
From heart-warming episodes

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,440
to fun stories, I'll be looking forward to it!

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,770
Please go ahead and send them to me!

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,950
We have a great view of the Lyrid Meteor Shower tonight.

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,550
It is rare for them to be seen in Tokyo sky.

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,150
Lyrids...

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,350
You guys all know that you can make your desires come true if you make a wish upon

21
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,150
a shooting star, right?

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,080
So why don't you tell the shooting stars tonight

23
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,750
about your feelings for that special someone?

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,620
I wish I can tell Irie about my feelings for him.

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,850
Tounan High School

26
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,650
Morning!

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,650
-Morning.
-Good morning.

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,510
-You're early today.
-Yeah. See you!

29
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,080
Dear Naoki Irie,

30
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,700
nice to meet you.

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm Kotoko Aihara from Class F.

32
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,700
You wouldn't know who I am,

33
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,820
but I know who you are.

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,880
As I walked the road to this place with my mom,

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,750
as I noticed those flowers on the cherry blossom trees,

36
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,760
no flower could tell our story...

37
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,830
For two years I've admired you and

38
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,350
your intellect that shone on the first day of school.

39
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,250
I don't dare expect to be in the same class with you.

40
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,610
So I hereby write a letter about my feelings for you.

41
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,090
From the first moment I saw you,

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,350
a special feeling started to burst

43
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,860
inside me as if I got hit by a shooting star.

44
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,910
Um...

45
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,590
Who are you?

46
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,530
I'm Kotoko Aihara, from Class F.

47
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,480
Would you read this?

48
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,950
I like...

49
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,250
you.

50
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,720
I don't need it.

51
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,600
My first love seemed to be shattered just like that.

52
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,350
No way.

53
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,140
But an unbelievable

54
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,910
miracle happens from now on.

55
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:23,150
Playful Kiss ~Love in Tokyo~

56
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,580
Episode 1
Love Along with a Shooting Star

57
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,450
Tounan High School

58
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,810
Hey! That's Aihara from Class F.

59
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,190
She told Irie that she likes him.

60
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,150
That Kotoko Aihara told Irie that she likes him.

61
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,030
It seems like...

62
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,410
She really doesn't know a thing.

63
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,850
Poor thing.

64
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,450
Leave me alone!

65
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,930
Kotoko! You told Irie about your feelings?

66
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,310
Jinko! Please be quiet.

67
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,710
How do you know about it?

68
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,370
You tried to give him a letter right in front of the school gate. That's attracts too much attention!

69
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,520
Everyone in this school knows.

70
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,250
-I'm so embarrassed.
-Why would you do that in front of the school gate?

71
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,590
It's like you are advertising them to know.

72
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,170
And to Irie...

73
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,050
Why would you do such reckless thing?

74
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,850
You know he won't accept it.

75
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,150
By any chance...

76
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,850
I thought he might like me

77
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,250
by any chance.

78
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,450
That would never happen. It's Naoki Irie!

79
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,690
As you already know, classes are divided by exam scores in this school.

80
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,050
Irie is the highest scorer in Class A, which has all kinds of top scorers.

81
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,850
Besides, he got the highest score in the last national exam.

82
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,950
You see, in life, lots of people know what to do.

83
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,150
But few people actually do what they know.

84
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,500
Knowing is not enough. You must take action.

85
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,950
There's a rumor that says his IQ is 200.

86
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,950
He's a genius and good looking. Besides, his father is a president of a company.

87
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,850
IQ 200, Height 178cm, Weight 60kg

88
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,050
He speaks English fluently.

89
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,750
He's an athlete as well. He's a super boy.

90
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,220
Compared to him, we are in Class F.

91
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,170
We are like the losers of this school.

92
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,120
We live in different world.

93
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,350
But I tried my best.

94
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,900
In my freshman, sophomore and junior year,

95
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,880
I did my best to be placed at Class A along with Naoki.

96
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,450
What's wrong?

97
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,850
Kotoko,

98
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,050
you know what alphabet is, right?

99
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,200
Of course.

100
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,010
Then, count how many letters are there between A and F.

101
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:36,050
A, B, C, D, E, F.

102
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,250
That's right. It would be a miracle for someone in F to be placed in A.

103
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,450
The possibility is lower than winning a lottery.

104
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,180
The possibility is lower than seeing snow in summer.

105
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,930
Lower than getting hit by a shooting star?

106
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,170
What? What did you say?

107
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,650
Never mind.

108
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,050
Anyhow, we live in different world from him.

109
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,610
That's true, but before I graduate,

110
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,810
I wanted to let him know of my feelings.

111
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,120
How naive.

112
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,950
Please accept this.

113
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,250
Naoki is good looking, but he's known for his grumpy personality.

114
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,750
He's not interested in girls at all. You can't even count how many girls have given him letters.

115
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,510
There was no rumor of him seeing a girl at all.

116
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,600
Hey! Kotoko!

117
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,500
She told Irie she likes him.

118
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,090
Shut up! Shush!

119
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
He's 18 years old!

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,700
There's no way he's not interested in girls. He's not normal.

121
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,400
That's right. I'm sure there's more normal guy in this world that would suit Kotoko.

122
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,200
Kotoko!

123
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,780
Hey! Kotoko!

124
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,200
Kotoko! Move!

125
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Hey!

126
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,600
Is it true that you got rejected by Irie from Class A after telling him about your feelings?

127
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,100
Kin! Too close!

128
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,500
You liked such nerd?

129
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,270
I'm here by your side.

130
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm not yours.

131
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,300
I baked this for you

132
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,840
this morning.

133
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,180
Excuse me.

134
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,200
Open it!

135
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,050
Kin's Takoyaki.

136
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,830
Hurry.

137
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Thank you!

138
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,000
So delicious.

139
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,490
Hey, hey, you need to spice it up.

140
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
You are really quick at changing your mood.

141
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,790
Well, Kin's good at cooking at least.

142
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,530
What do you mean "at least"?

143
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,240
No one's heart can compare to my heart for Kotoko.

144
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,400
Even if it were someone from Class A or a genius, mine's much better!

145
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,400
How dare he rejects Kotoko?

146
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,800
I'll take that as a challenge from him.

147
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,900
I'm sure he thinks he's something.

148
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,050
It's all right.

149
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,050
Like all of you say, I was too reckless.

150
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,670
Someone who wouldn't even read a letter is not good, right?

151
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,830
I...

152
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,390
I guess I'm not good at choosing guys.

153
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,670
So it's all right. I'm giving up.

154
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,790
Kotoko.

155
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,300
At this moment?

156
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,490
Well that's... I stayed overnight.

157
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,100
I was worried if I misspelled words, he would think I'm stupid.

158
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,400
I even looked up the kanji letters of my own name.

159
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,300
Ai

160
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,200
Hara

161
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
Koto

162
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
Ko

163
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,120
How stupid.

164
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,460
I was nervous.

165
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,000
I even skipped breakfast this morning.

166
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,100
So Kin, thank you.

167
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,400
I think I'll be able to survive morning classes with this.

168
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,300
You look the prettiest when you smile.

169
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
I can cook you as much as you want,

170
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,290
so cheer up.

171
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,710
Tasty!

172
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,500
You guys are eating too much!

173
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,700
You guys are cute.

174
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,100
-Let's sprinkle it as well.
-Of course Kotoko is the cutest.

175
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,600
Kotoko, sorry! Teacher called us.

176
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
It's all right. I didn't even wait for a long time.

177
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,680
Let's go.

178
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
So is your new house all built?

179
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,070
Yes. We are moving in on Sunday.

180
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,470
Finally your own house!

181
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,600
Right? It will cheer me up.

182
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,900
That's right. They say your luck changes according to a place you live.

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,200
I hope so.

184
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,800
I'd like to believe it that way.

185
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,300
You believe so.

186
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,500
I believe so.

187
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I'll go help.

188
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,180
Thank you.

189
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,310
So fun!

190
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,400
-Wow, that's huge.
-Here!

191
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
I brought them.

192
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Daddy!

193
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,600
Work properly, for the sake of Kotoko.

194
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,870
Good morning!

195
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Everyone!

196
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,880
Thank you for coming.

197
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,100
Father!

198
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,770
I will do anything for Kotoko.

199
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,170
I'm Kinnosuke Ikezawa.

200
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,790
-I'm Kintaro.
-I'm Dojo.

201
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,270
Please think of me as your own son.

202
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,800
You can ask me to do anything.

203
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,700
Kin, enough with your introduction! Move them!

204
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
-Okay.
-I'm coming too!

205
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you so much.

206
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,100
It's Kin who invited everyone else.

207
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,950
He wanted to comfort you after what happened with Irie.

208
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,460
I see.

209
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
All right! Let's do it.

210
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,620
-This?
-Yeah.

211
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,810
Go ahead.

212
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,950
You can take that to the second floor.

213
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,660
Second floor, right?

214
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,580
Heavy.

215
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,450
Second floor!

216
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,100
Thank you.

217
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,500
Thank you!

218
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,100
Thank you.

219
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,920
So we are done with packages.

220
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,560
All right!

221
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,520
Father, it's a good house.

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,380
Even though I wasn't a good man to my deceased wife and Kotoko,

223
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,400
I finally built this house,

224
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
along with Kotoko's help.

225
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,700
Everyone's watching!

226
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,200
It feels like something will happen when Kotoko gets married.

227
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,880
It's all right.

228
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,220
I'll always be his son.

229
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,470
Father,

230
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,100
please consider me your own son from now on.

231
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,400
Please call me Kin.

232
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,300
Thank you, everyone.

233
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,920
We were able to finish it quickly thanks to you guys.

234
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,140
Let's go in and have a meal together.

235
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,610
Right, Kotoko's father's a chef, right?

236
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,300
I'm excited!

237
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,500
Thank you.

238
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,200
Wait, wait!

239
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,700
Huh?

240
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,650
Don't you hear something weird?

241
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,900
I don't.

242
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,820
You must be mistaken.

243
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,940
I have a bad feeling.

244
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,220
What do you mean?

245
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,430
Huh? Shooting star?

246
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,290
What?

247
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,800
No way. It's the middle of the day.

248
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,400
Huh?

249
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,960
It got hit by a shooting star?

250
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,880
News 7:00

251
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,300
Today at noon,

252
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,600
a part of the Lyrids fell

253
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,800
and destroyed a house in Tokyo.

254
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,500
My daughter asked me what that was...

255
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,060
We interviewed the victim Shigeo Aihara.

256
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,310
It fell on our roof in a twinkle.

257
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,000
It rattled,

258
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,600
and then it collapsed.

259
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
It collapsed.

260
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,400
When it made a hole on my roof,

261
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
it wasn't that huge.

262
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,270
Well, luckily everyone was outside.

263
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,700
My deceased wife might have

264
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,300
saved us.

265
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:17,600
We worked hard to build that house. We don't have any other place to go.

266
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,100
According to the investigation, the meteor was only 3cm long.

267
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,650
An expert says that the meteor was only of a small significance,

268
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,230
and that jerry building is the cause of such collapse.

269
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,690
Next news.

270
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,900
Special break

271
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,500
I'm sorry. We are on a special break today.

272
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,810
Yes, please visit us next time.

273
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
Cheer up, Dad.

274
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,900
I worked hard up to these days.

275
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,800
We can do it again.

276
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,020
How am I supposed to run this restaurant?

277
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
I spent all my money for that house.

278
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,730
I can't even rent a room.

279
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,020
I mean...

280
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,190
A shooting star? Not even fire or an accident.

281
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
How ridiculous.

282
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,440
How unlucky I am.

283
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,270
That's not true. You are full of luck.

284
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,800
Well, if the star fell after we went in,

285
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,060
we might have all died.

286
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,900
Even if we were to survive, if you got your arms hurt, you won't be able to cook anymore.

287
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,060
Then, this restaurant would come to an end.

288
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,480
Right?

289
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,690
And here we are, with no trace of wounds at all.

290
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,020
We should be thankful. Can you think of a luckier thing than this?

291
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,650
We were really lucky.

292
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,270
Why?

293
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
You are really like your mom.

294
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,020
Your mom was really easygoing too.

295
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,650
Easygoing? Isn't there a better word than that?

296
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Anyhow,

297
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,480
what would be the possibility of getting hit by a shooting star?

298
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,700
Shooting star? It was a meteor.

299
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,980
Well, it's more romantic to think of it as a shooting star.

300
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,500
It feels like something special will happen.

301
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,300
My gosh. You are really after your mom.

302
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,800
This is Aihara.

303
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,980
Yes.

304
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,940
Excuse me?

305
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,310
Okay.

306
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,270
Could you hold for a second?

307
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,600
Sir, there's someone who'd like to speak to you.

308
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,100
Okay.

309
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,200
This is Aihara, I'm sorry for the...

310
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,770
Huh?

311
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,500
Iri? How have you been? Everything's fine?

312
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,600
Oh, I should ask that myself.

313
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,730
Iri?

314
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,150
Oh, Aihara from Class F.

315
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,100
It's her house that collapsed, right?

316
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,980
Have you heard the news? It was in the newspaper as well.

317
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,500
Gosh, it wasn't a long ago that she got rejected by Irie...

318
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,150
Kotoko, who got hit by the Lyrids.

319
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,770
Bad luck continues. Aren't you haunted or something?

320
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,980
Kotoko! Kotoko!

321
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,400
Jinko, Satomi.

322
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,150
You are always the center of the attention.

323
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,560
I'm burning with shame.

324
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,400
Anyhow, have you found any place to stay? Are you all right?

325
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,500
Thank you. Well, we are going to stay at the house of my dad's friend.

326
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,520
Really? How did you find it?

327
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,730
He saw the news and called us.

328
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,650
Wow, what a nice guy. Thank goodness. I'm sure you will be lucky from now on.

329
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,400
Right? The possibility of getting hit by a shooting star is really low.

330
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,900
I'd like to believe such rare luck will come and find me.

331
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,800
That's you right there.

332
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
Right?

333
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,800
Please donate! 10 yen, 20 yen is fine!

334
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,020
5 yen is fine as well!

335
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,650
Yesterday, because of the fall of the Lyrids,

336
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,440
Kotoko Aihara from 3-F has lost her house.

337
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,900
We are raising fund for her.
As students in the same school,

338
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,400
for Kotoko who has lost her house,

339
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
he's really dumb.

340
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Well, it's Kin...

341
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,770
Kin! Stop it.

342
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,600
Here's Kotoko!

343
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,480
Even after what happened yesterday,

344
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,900
she's all cheerful and bright. She's cute today as well.

345
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,980
You make me cry.

346
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,400
Kin, stop it! You are a fool!

347
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,300
What do you mean? I'm doing this for you.

348
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,900
I don't want to attract any more attention in school!

349
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,190
Now you are the center of the attention.

350
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,850
More rumors coming.

351
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,810
Would you move?

352
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,100
Irie!

353
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,000
You are being rude.

354
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,270
Kotoko's really hurt right now. Who do you think did this?

355
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,900
The Lyrids, right?

356
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,520
That is a different part of the story! It's because you were being so cold-hearted!

357
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,400
What the...

358
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,480
Your cold heart was the cause for Kotoko's bad luck.

359
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,190
The chance of extraterrestrial planet impacting a human being is 1 to 500 million.

360
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,850
Planet?

361
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,400
Are you talking about a shooting star?

362
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,100
So I'm the cause of that 1-to-500 million

363
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,500
possibility event?

364
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,520
That's right.

365
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,770
Kin, that's too much.

366
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,440
So I'm quite amazing.

367
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,650
If I donate money, you won't say anything, right?

368
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,560
What?

369
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,900
Don't make a fool of me!

370
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,270
I wasted two years liking someone like you!

371
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,810
I don't need your pity.

372
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,020
Are you sure you are fine with that?

373
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,980
Of course. Do you even have a friend, treating people like that?

374
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,130
Look! I have tons of friends who help me when I'm in trouble.

375
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,900
Kin, Jinko and Satomi!

376
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,400
Kotoko, good job!

377
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,980
So I don't need your favor!

378
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,100
Take it, take it.

379
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,690
What, what's wrong with Class F?

380
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,100
Stop treating people like that!

381
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,850
So you are the talk of this town again.

382
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,400
You would be the only one arguing with Naoki Irie.

383
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,200
What should I do? I didn't mean to do that.

384
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,800
I'm sorry I made you leave school early.

385
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,270
No problem. It's an excused absence.

386
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,400
Teacher knows what happened.

387
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,000
This is Iri's house.

388
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,350
What a big house.

389
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,690
Iri's a president of a big company.

390
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,690
He graduated from Tokyo University.

391
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,770
Tokyo University... He must be someone great.

392
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,980
They would be able to hold a barbecue party.

393
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,900
RIE... Fomi... Fami...

394
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,350
Ah, Irie.

395
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,700
The Iries.

396
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,800
Irie?

397
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,480
I call him Iri because he's Irie.

398
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,980
Why Irie?

399
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,500
What's wrong?

400
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,100
Nothing.

401
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,150
Ai! Welcome!

402
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What happened? You are late.

403
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,900
I'm sorry. I went to pick up some packages.

404
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,650
My gosh.

405
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,940
Welcome!

406
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,400
Wow, amazing.

407
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,500
I was just talking to myself.

408
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,940
Irie...

409
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,350
Welcome.

410
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:18,270
Make yourself at home.

411
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,810
I'm sorry, and thank you, Iri.

412
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,690
No problem.

413
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,440
Thank you.

414
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,300
What an accident it was. Please make yourself at home.

415
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,690
I'm his daughter, Kotoko. Nice to meet you.

416
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,560
What a cute daughter.

417
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,690
I only have sons.

418
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,100
You have sons?

419
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,060
I'll introduce him to you later. Come inlside.

420
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,690
Come, come!

421
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,900
Come inside.

422
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,440
Thank you.

423
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,230
Yuki!

424
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,650
Say hello to him. He's Mr. Aihara.

425
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,850
Oh, that's your son.

426
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,000
Good afternoon.

427
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,800
Nice to meet you, I'm Yuki Irie. I'm in third grade.

428
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,100
What a smart one.

429
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,310
Nice to meet you.

430
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,270
Nice to meet you, Yuki.

431
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,480
You are all tired, right? Come over here.

432
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Excuse me.

433
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,900
Excuse me!

434
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,400
Go ahead.

435
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm glad you like it. Take some more.

436
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,810
Thank you.

437
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,980
Kotoko, you've grown up very much.

438
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,730
Have I ever met you before?

439
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,060
I saw you at the restaurant when you were a baby.

440
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,190
You've been to my dad's restaurant?

441
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,560
Of course. We are hometown best friends

442
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,690
ever since we were in kindergarten.

443
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,190
Since both my parents worked,

444
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,190
I often went to Ai's house to have dinner.

445
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,600
When I was in college, I was a poor student,

446
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,300
So Ai always used to invite me.

447
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,100
I'm indebted to Ai.

448
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,400
What are you talking about? It was you who introduced my restaurant to all kinds of people.

449
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,560
Your college classmates, business partners,

450
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,890
there are tons of people who still visit me.

451
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,440
I'm here thanks to your effort.

452
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,060
After having each one's family

453
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,060
and job, we might have become a little distant,

454
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,650
but I was surprised after watching that news.

455
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,700
Well... It was sudden,

456
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,900
but I'm glad I get to see you again like this.

457
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,560
That's right.

458
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Kotoko, please make yourself at home.

459
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,850
Okay. Thank you.

460
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,850
It seems like we have a special connection with you.

461
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,640
Speaking of the devil, my elder boy's back.

462
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,350
Elder boy?

463
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,700
What's wrong, Kotoko?

464
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,100
She's really powerful.

465
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,480
Sorry for being late. I'm Naoki.

466
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,650
Nice to meet you.

467
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
I heard it.

468
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,350
Kotoko and Naoki go to same school.

469
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,600
Is that so? Nice to meet you.

470
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,020
Kotoko, go ahead and greet him.

471
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,440
What's wrong, Kotoko?

472
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,690
Well... I was too surprised.

473
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,900
Mr. Iri and Naoki don't look alike at all.

474
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,810
You are being rude!

475
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,770
It's all right. My sons

476
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,600
all look alike their mom. They were lucky.

477
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,150
My gosh... Naoki, sit down.

478
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,190
Thank goodness both of you are safe.

479
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,600
You weren't inside the house?

480
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,150
If Kotoko didn't stop me, I would've been inside.

481
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,020
What a coincidence.

482
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,900
So how big was that meteor?

483
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,560
It was small like this.

484
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,230
Like 4cm long?

485
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Can that make a house collapse?

486
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,270
But how thankful.

487
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,400
So Kotoko knew about Naoki.

488
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,440
Are you guys in the same class?

489
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,770
We are in very different classes, but I got to know her with a strange incident lately.

490
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,190
Right, Kotoko?

491
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,560
Well...

492
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,650
How great. You guys can get closer from now on.

493
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,230
Naoki's bit strange, right?

494
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,770
Please be gentle with him.

495
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,100
Naoki, I finished today's homework.

496
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,940
Yeah? Good job.

497
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Well, there was a kanji letter I couldn't read.

498
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,230
Should I ask Kotoko about it today?

499
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,310
Why don't you?

500
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,730
Kotoko, can you teach me how to read kanji letters?

501
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,020
All right.

502
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,980
He's in third grade. I should be fine.

503
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,770
What's wrong?

504
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,940
Yuki, you are amazing.

505
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,020
You are studying very difficult kanji letters for your age.

506
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,520
So which one do you have question about?

507
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,150
This one.

508
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,850
This is...

509
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,940
Bunny's horn.

510
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,770
Bunny's horn.

511
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,730
You are so stupid!

512
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,060
This is "tonikaku*".
(*Anyhow)

513
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,730
You are in high school, and yet you can't even read this?

514
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,560
Yuki, what are you doing? Apologize!

515
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,900
"Anyhow", I don't like someone like you.

516
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,060
Hey! Yuki!

517
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,190
Hey!

518
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,150
I'm sorry.

519
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,500
It's all right. I couldn't answer his question.

520
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,770
It's all right! I'm sure he's doing that because he's shy.

521
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,810
Don't mind that, Kotoko.

522
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,100
Then,

523
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,600
Kotoko, would you like to take a look around your room?

524
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,120
Yeah!

525
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,560
I was excited. Over here.

526
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,300
Go ahead.

527
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,300
-I'd like some macane.
-Macaroon? Macaroon.

528
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,190
I was just kidding.

529
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,520
How do you like it?

530
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,060
You don't like it?

531
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,900
Did I overdo it?

532
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,300
Since I only have sons,

533
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,230
I have always wanted to do something like this

534
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,100
for my daughter.

535
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,480
Princess-like room, dolls,

536
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,060
I'm very happy.

537
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:24,270
My mom passed away when I was young, so I have never been able to enjoy this girly stuff.

538
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:29,810
And my dad never cares about this kind of things.

539
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,100
So I was always jealous of my friends with

540
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,850
feminine outfit.

541
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,100
It feels like my dream came true.

542
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,060
So...

543
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:50,400
It has always been my dream to go shopping, watch movies, and change clothes with my daughter.

544
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,300
Let's be friends forever, Kotoko.

545
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,400
Okay!

546
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,800
This room used to be Yuki's.

547
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,400
Thanks to you, his desk is in my room now.

548
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
He's complaining about sharing a room.

549
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,300
We were having fun!

550
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,020
Naoki, don't ruin it.

551
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,400
That's why he was like that...

552
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,310
Anyhow, I don't like someone like you.

553
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,270
Don't worry, Kotoko.

554
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,020
Just make yourself at home. All right?

555
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,650
Okay.

556
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,770
Then, Naoki, help her unpack.

557
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,980
I'm going to go prepare dinner.

558
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,190
Tonight we are having sukiyaki.

559
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,100
Do you like sukiyaki?

560
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,190
I do!

561
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,600
Thank goodness! See you then!

562
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,520
Okay!

563
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,690
Well...

564
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,730
So,

565
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,230
what should I do to help you?

566
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,600
It's all right. I can do it myself.

567
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,310
Ah,

568
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,520
right.

569
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,730
I have no right to help you, right?

570
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,480
I don't care whether you exist or not.

571
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,190
Don't interrupt my life.

572
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,690
The chance of a man to get hit by a shooting star is 1 to 10 billion.

573
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,650
The chance of a high school girl

574
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,100
to live with a boy who just rejected her

575
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,900
would be like 1 to 1 billion.

576
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,190
Is this a beginning of something special?

577
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,940
Or...

578
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
Here it is.

579
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,270
Take some more.

580
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,200
Thank you!

581
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,300
Mr. Aihara, would you like some more?

582
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,300
Thank you.

583
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,190
Ai, is it all right for you to have bread for breakfast?

584
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,440
-Would you prefer some rice?
-It's all right. It's fresh.

585
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,020
-Really?
-Yeah.

586
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,650
It feels like I'm abroad.

587
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,650
It feels like I'm in Monaco.

588
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,200
Monaco?

589
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm eating a breakfast

590
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,500
with Naoki...

591
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,100
Hot!

592
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,270
How tacky.

593
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,600
I'm done.

594
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,770
Already?

595
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,850
Kotoko, why don't you leave with him? Same school!

596
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:58,770
Okay.

597
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,190
Dad, here you go.

598
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,200
Thank you. Bye!

599
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,900
Bye!

600
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,400
-Hey...
-Yes?

601
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,800
Would you step away from me?

602
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,900
Why?

603
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,810
I don't want to walk with a girl with crumbs on.

604
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,270
Stay at least 2 meters away from me.

605
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,980
Just walk behind me to learn the way to school.

606
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,560
And of course, don't tell anyone that we live together.

607
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,350
Don't talk to me at school.

608
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,270
You don't need to be so cold like that.

609
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,000
I don't want to get caught in a stupid rumor.

610
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,770
Stupid...?

611
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,560
I don't like stupid girls.

612
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,020
Gosh!

613
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,230
I can't believe I was in love with this kind of guy for two years.

614
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,940
I decided I would make him regret.

615
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,350
So even a genius has a weak point.

616
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,400
For a week before final exams, tutor me.

617
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,440
It's impossible to make someone stupid like you to be in the top 100 list.

618
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,560
Isn't something weird with her ever since she moved into a new house?

619
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,770
She left with another one already.

620
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,400
I feel like he's going to lose something precious if he keeps being that way.

621
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,650
Aihara!

622
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,060
Wouldn't Irie change his mind or something and ask Kotoko out?

623
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,060
Naoki! Thank you!
