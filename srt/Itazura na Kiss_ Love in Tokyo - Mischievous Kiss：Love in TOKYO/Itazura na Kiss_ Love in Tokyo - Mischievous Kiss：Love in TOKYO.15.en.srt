1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,680
Irie-kun, is it true you're going to have an arranged marriage meeting?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,100
The girl's a granddaughter of the chairman of a company named Hokueisha.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,470
'Ruin the meeting' huh?

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,140
Sahoko-san wants to move forward.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,260
What?

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,300
I felt like the distance between Irie-kun and I, shortened.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,640
That's why, I can't accept the reality yet.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,220
Kotoko's a precious person to me

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,850
You've been toying with her feelings. How can I keep my mouth shut?

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,520
The what are you going to do?

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,540
I'll take Kotoko away from you.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,070
No, I'll protect her.
-Do what you want.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,240
Next Sunday,

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,580
do you want to go out with me?

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,040
Sure, let's go out. Just the two of us.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,250
Irie-kun and I

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,030
are about to start walking different paths.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,600
Further down those paths,

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,890
I wonder what future awaits us.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,350
Good morning.

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,580
Good morning.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,100
Kotoko-chan's on a date today.

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,040
Date?

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,580
She's dressed up very nice and went out.

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,910
So please don't bother us.

26
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,540
I'm sure you understand since you have a girl you want to marry.

27
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,510
Just as she's very precious to you,

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,580
Kotoko's very precious to me.

29
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,320
I can not stand seeing Kotoko

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,930
suffer so much

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,140
The guy must have bad taste.

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,140
Naoki, are you really sure about this?

33
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,580
Naoki!

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,390
I'm sorry,

35
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,680
but I have to read some documents for the meeting Monday.

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,510
Oh, dear.

37
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,900
That was so fun!

38
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,580
The scene where the car speeds by was amazing!

39
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,600
It was exhilarating!

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,800
Alright! Today all of your stress will disappear.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,340
Do you want to go to the arcade?

42
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,690
I do! I do! I do!

43
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,970
I want to go!
-Let's go!

44
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,550
Now we have no choice but to dance! Dance, Kotoko!

45
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,470
I'm going.
-I'm taking off.

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,580
There's something. See, there's something.

47
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,450
Go, Kin-chan!

48
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,270
Alright.
-Yes.

49
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,310
This is good!

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,050
One more!

51
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,830
The time I spent with Kin-chan was,

52
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,650
more fun than I'd expected.

53
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,710
For a little while,

54
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,120
I could forget about Irie-kun,

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,860
while I was on this date.

56

Mischievious Kiss: Love in TOKYO

75
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,850
-You had a date with Kin-chan?
-Yes.

76
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,210
Episode 15: Goodbye Irie-kun

77
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,570
Kin-chan and I have been friends since high school.

78
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,450
Yet, come to think of it,
it was the first time I went out with him alone.

79
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,260
So then, so then how was the date?

80
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,890
Kin-chan, after all, wasn't good enough, huh.

81
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,410
It not like that.

82
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,200
It was actually more fun than I thought it'd be.

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,690
Time flew by so quickly.

84
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,710
And?

85
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,310
It was fun today. Thank you.

86
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,640
I haven't felt this refreshed in a long time.

87
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,470
See you later.

88
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,510
Kotoko!

89
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,800
Will you,

90
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,300
go out with me again?

91
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,050
I'll find a place where you can have fun again.

92
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,250
Don't take it too seriously. Just think that you want to
go out to relieve some stress,

93
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,300
and I happen to be the with you.

94
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,950
Sure.

95
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,200
Let's go on another date, Kin-chan.

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,510
Okay.

97
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,810
What?

98
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,630
-Kotoko
-Kotoko

99
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,700
Actually...

100
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
we promised to have another date.

101
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,510
Huh!? Is this a twist?

102
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,390
It is a big reversal?

103
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,220
It's not like that, but...

104
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,940
It doesn't matter if it's a date or party...

105
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,000
Sit down, sit down! Kotoko-chan.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,850
If you could forget about the heartless Irie...

107
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,730
even for a split second and enjoy your life, it's good.

108
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,900
Satomi.

109
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,200
You don't have to rush to find a boyfriend.

110
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,350
Don't rush to tell him your answer.

111
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,870
Right now, you should just have fun with whoever is available

112
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,810
even if it's Kin-chan.

113
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,470
That's right. If it cheers you up, that's all that matters.

114
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,130
But isn't that rude to Kin-chan?

115
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,360
You know what?
If you think that way,

116
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,800
even the slightest bit...

117
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,070
that means you must love Kin-chan.

118
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,500
It's so true!

119
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,290
You care about him more than you care about yourself.

120
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,600
It's nothing but your love for him.

121
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,990
So do you love Kin-chan?

122
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,350
I don't know about that, but...

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,470
Kin-chan is...

124
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,260
such a nice person.

125
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,260
Hey!

126
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,380
You just realized that?

127
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,910
It was a great performance.

128
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,330
Yes.

129
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,860
I really like Stravinsky.

130
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,550
It's very like you, Naoki-san

131
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,750
Because Stravinsky

132
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,640
changes his style depending on the work.

133
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,680
His nickname is Chameleon.

134
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,860
You are mysterious like his music.

135
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,140
I think that is your charm.

136
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,180
You are overrating me.

137
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,910
But I was upset

138
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,440
because the person right front of us...

139
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,300
he fell asleep right after the performance started.

140
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,160
He was swaying his head as he drifted off.

141
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,900
And he even had such good seats.

142
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,640
What is it, Noaki-san?

143
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,210
Oh, it's nothing.

144
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,950
Well, let's go.

145
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,160
The restaurant that we're going today plays opera music.

146
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,170
Do you like opera?

147
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,980
Of course.

148
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,400
I would like to listen to Tristan.

149
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,610
Tristan sounds good.

150
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,330
I'm home.

151
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,140
Naoki, you are late.

152
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,950
I told you that I would be late because I was going to a concert with Sahoko-san.

153
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,100
You did, but how long were you listening to music?

154
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I also told you that I wouldn't need food because I was going to have dinner after the concert.

155
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,510
Naoki,

156
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,970
you haven't done anything physical with her ?

157
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,530
What do you mean "anything physical" ?

158
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm not in junior high, you know.

159
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,450
We are dating while considering marriage in the future.

160
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,060
The rest is up to your imagination.

161
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,550
But I haven't given you permission for that.

162
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,810
Dad said it, too. That I should
decide who to marry on my own.

163
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,270
You were seen nodding then.

164
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,220
I did...

165
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,630
but I though he meant Kotoko-chan.
- Anyway,

166
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,930
I will not hesitate to make my own decision about my marriage.

167
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,130
Geez.

168
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,460
Hi, I'm home.

169
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,190
You too, Kotoko-chan. It's so late.

170
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,170
Did you also have a date?

171
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,180
Also?
Irie-kun had one?

172
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,860
We went to a concert.

173
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,430
Oh, I see.

174
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,030
I didn't have a date.

175
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,380
Mrs. Irie, actually, starting today,
I am helping at my father's restaurant.

176
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,310
Helping at his restaurant?

177
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,150
Are you going to be a chef?

178
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,210
Of course not. That is impossible.

179
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,010
That's relief. This means less people getting sick.

180
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,350
I can't help with cooking, but

181
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,580
I thought I could wait tables.

182
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,760
So I'm trying to learn.

183
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,830
Kin-chan is at the restaurant, so he can teach me.

184
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,300
So it was like a date after all.

185
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,400
I don't mix up my love and work life like someone else does.

186
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Doesn't that depend on the person?

187
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,290
How dare you?!

188
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,090
You better apologize to Kin-chan.

189
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,350
See?

190
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,830
- I was right.
- Even if you are right, it's none your business.

191
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,730
True.

192
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,530
I have no interest in your love life to begin with.

193
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,620
Please, you two. Oh my...

194
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,700
you are arguing like a married couple.

195
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,380
a married couple.

196
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,700
No, we are not.

197
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,690
I don't need dinner tomorrow again.

198
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,320
You're going on another date?

199
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,890
It's not your concern. Good night.

200
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,590
Kotoko-chan.

201
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,270
I have to go too, because I need to prepare for tomorrow's classes.

202
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,410
I'll go.

203
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,880
Also, I won't need dinner either since I will eat at the restaurant from now on.

204
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,840
Good night.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,310
This is not going well, Dad (Honey).

206
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:42,360
Naoki is steadily moving toward marrying Sahoko-san.

207
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,190
And it seems like Kotoko-chan

208
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,830
has been going on dates with the young chef, Kin-chan.

209
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,770
And not only that , she helps out at the restaurant.

210
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,740
The distance between her and that boy
is getting closer and closer.

211
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,760
About that... Kanamori called me yesterday and said...

212
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,350
Chairman Oizumi

213
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,660
wants to set the date or their

214
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,720
engagement ceremony as soon as I leave the hospital.

215
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,980
Great. At this rate, you might be able to go home.

216
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,050
- Really?
- Yes.

217
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,460
You did a great job.

218
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,230
It's because you did a good job for my surgery, Doctor.

219
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,980
Thank you.

220
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,190
But your dream is to become a doctor, isn't it ?

221
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,200
It's hasn't been long since I had that dream.

222
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,070
So you're going to give up?

223
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,370
What did you want to tell me?

224
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,650
Ah...

225
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,860
You know that I will be discharged this weekend, don't you?

226
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,180
Yes.

227
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,760
Actually my heart isn't in a good condition.

228
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,020
I'll eventually need surgery.

229
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,790
I know, even if you try to hide it.

230
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,560
Just as I can you, I can tell what your mother thinks
by looking at her face.

231
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,600
However, before I have the surgery,
I will go back to the company.

232
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,630
I'm going to fix

233
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,720
all of the company's problems on my own.
Then I will have a surgery.

234
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,240
Yet

235
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,950
if you go back to work, your heart will be under stress again.

236
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,380
Even so,

237
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,450
I can't let you marry someone you don't love.

238
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,570
Someone I don't love?

239
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,760
Don't just assume that.

240
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,490
Naoki.

241
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,330
You are my son.

242
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,370
More than my company or anything...

243
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,310
your happiness is the most important to me.

244
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,270
- That's why - - -
- You don't have to tell me!

245
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,950
I decide my own life choices.

246
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,180
So don't think about

247
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,960
unnecessary things, Dad.

248
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,230
And please focus on getting better.

249
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,980
Kotoko, can you bring this to table 3?

250
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,590
Yes.

251
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,710
I'll clean this for you, so just bring the food.

252
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,770
Thank you, Kin-chan.

253
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,610
They are great together.

254
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,660
Everyone, Dad is home!

255
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,180
I'm home...

256
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,140
Yuki.

257
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,210
- Dad, congratulations on coming home.
- Thank you.

258
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,570
Here we go!

259
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,750
- Oji-sama!
- Iri-chan!
- Honey!

260
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,270
Just kidding! Just kidding! Just kidding!

261
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,690
I'm feeling very well.

262
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,340
I'm back completely.

263
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,430
- Please don't tease us, honey.
- Sorry, sorry.

264
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,630
Madam, this only shows that Iri-chan is all better now.

265
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,330
Let's celebrate today!

266
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,730
Thank you!

267
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,340
Go, go.

268
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,680
J, O, B, now everybody...

269
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,810
Thank you for waiting.

270
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,230
Everything looks very good.

271
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,570
These are all foods that you like, Iri-chan.

272
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,350
I'm so happy. The food at the hospital had no taste.

273
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,420
You are not back completely yet.

274
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,610
You should avoid alcohol, cigarettes, greasy and sweet food.

275
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,400
Oh, please.

276
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,480
Don't you know how much I had to endure with the hospital food?

277
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,470
That's not the point.

278
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,560
Here, here. Naoki is right.

279
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,660
Honey, you have to take it easy.

280
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,840
Let's celebrate your discharge from the hospital.

281
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,780
- Raise your glasses.
- Yes.

282
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,360
Can we have a word from you?

283
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,310
It was all so sudden

284
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:20,190
that I had to stay at the hospital. I'm sorry that I made you worry and gave you trouble.

285
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,440
But thanks to everyone, I'm better now
and I could leave the hospital.

286
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,820
I really thank you.

287
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,830
Cheers!

288
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,610
Cheers!

289
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,730
Please have some food.

290
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,600
Alright. I'll have some of Ai-chan's food.

291
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,250
Thank you for the food.

292
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,560
Meat, meat, meat!

293
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,860
Some fish.

294
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,790
Eat!

295
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,270
What's with this, come here.

296
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,780
This looks yummy.

297
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,440
After all, my home is the best.

298
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,110
It's so great

299
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,120
to have food with the family, isn't it?

300
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,630
I feel so relaxed being with only family members.

301
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,500
Huh? I think someone is here.

302
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,050
Strange. We're having a family meal today. I didn't invite anyone else.

303
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,380
No, I invited them.

304
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,370
Who'd he invite?

305
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,010
I've got bad feeling about this.

306
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,000
Chairman Oizumi.

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,620
Well, well Irie-kun. Congrats on coming home.

308
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,190
Right, Naoki-kun invited us for today's party. So we came to celebrate.

309
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,590
Thank you all for coming all the way here.

310
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,970
I really appreciate it.

311
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,560
We're happy to be here.

312
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,580
Naoki! I told you today's celebration was only for family.

313
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,950
That's why I invited them.

314
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,050
Father.

315
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,610
This is Oizumi Sahoko-san..

316
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,630
Nice to meet you.

317
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,320
Please sit down here. Kotoko move.

318
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,790
Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

319
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,740
Excuse me.

320
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,330
This is my wife... oh, you've already met my wife.

321
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,210
This is Naoki's younger brother, Yuki.

322
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,220
Nice to meet you.

323
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,940
Nice to meet you.

324
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,580
Mr. Irie.
-Yes?

325
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,110
Congratulations on coming home from the hospital.

326
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,410
This is a little something.

327
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,610
What's this?

328
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,040
Wow!

329
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,190
Wow, this is great.

330
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,020
Here.

331
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,350
Mmmm, delicious. You made all this, Sahoko-san?

332
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,640
I hope you like it.

333
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,220
Who wouldn't? It's very simple, but the flavors are spot on.

334
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,880
It's sharp but also rich. This is more than just delicious.

335
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,650
Honey, stop exaggerating so much.
We already had food from professional chef, Aihara-san.

336
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,440
Ah...

337
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,320
Could it be that you made this without any animal oil and sugar?

338
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,640
Yes, because I heard that Mr. Irie has a heart problem.

339
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,440
It tastes so good that I can hardly tell.

340
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,970
I'm very impressed.

341
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,740
Chairman. This gentleman over here owns a Japanese restaurant.

342
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,120
His restaurant's very popular.

343
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,020
Oh, really?

344
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm embarrassed to have a professional taste my food.

345
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,970
Don't be. I wish you could help out at my restaurant.

346
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,080
You used sweet sake instead of sugar for this dish?

347
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,230
Yes, it's as you thought.

348
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,020
Where did you learn to cook professionally?

349
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,990
I just learned from my mother.

350
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,210
Really? Your mom's cooking skills must be like a professional's.

351
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,300
I'm learning a lot from this.

352
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,170
Amazing. It's so yummy!

353
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,510
Isn't it?

354
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,440
So, are you Irie-kun's best friend?

355
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
I'm sorry that I didn't introduce myself sooner. I'm Aihara.

356
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,390
Please forgive us for being rude and attending your family party.

357
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:11,860
And this lady here's the one who lives with you?

358
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,680
Nice to meet you. I'm Aihara Kotoko.

359
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
I see.

360
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,690
I'm sorry. It's just that I've heard Mrs. Irie really likes her.

361
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,770
So I was very curious.

362
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,040
Grandfather, it's rude to stare at Kotoko-san like that.

363
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,580
I apologize.

364
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,130
It's because you're so cute,

365
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,810
that I couldn't help but stare.

366
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,870
I'm very flattered.

367
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,120
Um, Kotoko-san. Can we go outside and talk for a bit?

368
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,880
I've been hoping to talk to you.

369
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,670
I'm so sorry that my grandfather was being rude to you.

370
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,210
Don't worry.
It didn't bother me.

371
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,830
To be honest, my grandfather and I...

372
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,990
are jealous of you.

373
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,290
What? Of me?

374
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,960
-Because you've lived with Naoki-san for more than two years.
-Well, Yes...

375
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,310
And Naoki-san's mother likes you, too.

376
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,920
That's why we are envious of you, Kotoko-san.

377
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,680
Hey...

378
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,750
Sahoko-san,

379
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,670
why do you like Irie-kun?

380
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:04,820
The day my grandfather told me to come to his company...

381
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,120
to tell me something important.

382
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,470
Actually it was about the arranged marriage meeting with Naoki-san.

383
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,630
Are you okay?

384
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,820
He was a gentleman and kind...

385
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,150
I fell in love with him at first sight.

386
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,760
But I had never thought that the man was Naoki-san.

387
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,790
So when I met him again at the meeting, I was really suprised.

388
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,880
I thought it was fate.

389
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,170
I, too, fell in love with Irie-kun at first sight.

390
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,860
I had a one-way love for two years since then.

391
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,380
And we happened to live in the same house.

392
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:11,620
But I never had the chance to feel that was fate.

393
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,760
The time passed by without making any progress in our relationship.

394
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,690
I wish I met him in the way that you did.

395
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,510
You wish you met him?

396
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,530
Oh no, I hope I will meet someone...

397
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,550
Actually, I was going to refuse the arranged marriage.

398
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,090
I thought it was too early since I was still in college.

399
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,740
But my grandfather told me to at least meet him.
He made me attend the meeting.

400
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,370
Despite all of that...
I had never expected this would happen.

401
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,290
Life is very strange, isn't it?

402
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,200
You are right.

403
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,380
But...

404
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,810
I'm scared.

405
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,020
Why?

406
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,450
The more Naoki-san is kind to me...

407
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,100
I feel like the true Naoki-san is moving further and further away.

408
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,710
I feel like I can't tell what he is really thinking.

409
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,990
I lose my confidence.

410
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,120
It's strange, isn't it?

411
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,080
I think...

412
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,620
-It happens because you really love Irie-kun.
-What?

413
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:01,230
It's not strange at all.
When you love someone wouldn't you feel that way?

414
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,150
Even though you're determined not to give up...

415
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,550
you would lose your confidence over little things.

416
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,250
You are beautiful and quiet.
If a perfect woman like you feels that way...

417
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,170
regular girls would feel that way even more.

418
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,840
Yet, if he is kind to you just a little bit...

419
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,780
you are overjoyed and hope

420
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,330
for something more to happen.

421
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,730
You become the happiest person in the whole world.

422
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,090
However,

423
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,030
when he is cold to you again...

424
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,700
you get scared, thinking he hates you.

425
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,610
It's a never-ending circle.

426
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:09,890
You think you will try to do your best.
But your feelings always go up and down.

427
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,770
Kotoko-san,

428
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,860
You have loved someone too.

429
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,560
No, that's not it...

430
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,310
Nevertheless,

431
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,060
I know... Irie-kun

432
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,870
truly loves you,

433
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,980
Sahoko-san.

434
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,840
I can tell he is madly in love with you.

435
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,330
How can you be so sure?

436
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,940
I don't know why.

437
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,520
I can't really answer that.

438
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,030
But I think so.

439
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,960
So please rest assured.

440
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,800
Thank you for having us.

441
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,680
Irie-kun, make sure that you don't work too hard.

442
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,540
Yes.

443
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,120
I will visit you before anything after I get back to work.

444
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,950
Don't forget the engagement ceremony before that.
Right, Naoki-kun and Sahoko?

445
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,850
Yes,

446
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,520
I appreciate your help.

447
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,800
Well then, Irie-kun,

448
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,610
We will talk about the schedule later.

449
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,400
Yes.

450
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,410
Thank you so much for coming all the way here.

451
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,500
Let's get going, Sahoko.

452
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,620
I would like to walk with Naoki-san for a little bit.

453
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,840
Do you mind, Naoki-kun?

454
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,230
Not at all.
I'll make sure she arrives home safe.

455
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,430
Please take good of her then.

456
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,640
Well then.

457
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,290
Good night.

458
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,640
Should we go?

459
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,220
Yes.

460
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,970
I'm so tired.
I will throw some salt to purify the house.

461
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,830
Honey, don't say that.

462
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,800
But are you sure about this, Honey?

463
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,280
Naoki made the decision.
We can't help it.

464
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,970
Kotoko-chan, let's finish it tomorrow.

465
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,600
You must be tired.

466
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,480
Somehow I'm wide awake.
I will just finish washing the dishes.

467
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,140
You must be tired since it was a very busy day.

468
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,630
Please go to sleep.

469
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,600
But I feel bad.

470
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,740
I'm fine.
There is only a little bit left.

471
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,970
Kotoko-chan.

472
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,100
I'm sorry.

473
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,070
I'm really sorry.

474
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,380
I kept telling you that we were going to have you marry into our family.

475
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,660
Yet this happened.

476
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,110
I was trying to root for you two.

477
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,210
However, I ended up hurting your feelings.

478
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,120
I feel really awful for what happened.

479
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,450
It's not your fault, Mrs. Irie.

480
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,850
I still can't give up on you, Kotoko-chan.

481
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,280
Thank you very much.

482
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,490
I'm extremely happy...

483
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,270
that you are thinking of me like that.

484
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:55,490
I think of you as my real mother.

485
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,590
I have been and I always will.

486
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,600
No matter who Irie-kun marries.

487
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,030
Kotoko-chan...

488
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,440
truly, I . . .

489
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm home.

490
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,840
You're late, aren't you?

491
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,470
Where are my parents? Are they in bed?

492
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,390
I see.

493
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,030
Night.

494
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,480
Hey.

495
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,920
Sahoko-san is really a wonderful person.

496
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,720
She is beautiful, isn't she?
Her cooking is amazing, too.

497
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,830
Not only that...

498
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:16,930
After talking with her, I can tell she really likes you.

499
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:28,230
Someone like her likes you.
It's only natural for you to like her back.

500
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,560
You should find a good guy soon.

501
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,810
Good morning!

502
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,710
Oh, morning.

503
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,960
Is it only you here?

504
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,120
Where is Kin and Odawara?

505
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,130
Yeah, I sent them to grocery shopping.

506
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,160
Is that right?

507
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,340
Then I'll clean up.

508
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,420
Hey, Kotoko, can I talk to you?

509
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,850
Before work, I have something to tell you.

510
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,730
What is it, Dad?

511
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,590
We should move out of Iri-chan's house.

512
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,420
You saw it yesterday, too.

513
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,680
Naoki really means to get married.

514
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,000
If that happens, it's weird for us to stay there.

515
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,740
The Oizumi family wouldn't like it, either.

516
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,780
In this way, we can't make an end and settle things down.

517
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,870
So let's find a new place and move out.

518
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,560
I don't care anymore if it's old or not large enough.

519
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,050
Right? We should do that.

520
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,820
I understand how painful it must be for you.

521
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,130
I must be very uncool, huh.

522
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,150
No matter how much I'm hurt,
I decided by myself not to give up on my feelings for Irie-kun.

523
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,490
Despite this,

524
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,160
It's also important to know when to stop.

525
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,050
It's a chance for you that Naoki will
think of you as a good woman, right?

526
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,790
Hurry and forget about Naoki.

527
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:09,500
How many shooting stars have I been praying to?

528
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,430
But anymore...

529
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,180
I have to stop it.

530
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,480
Mom, don't make that face.

531
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,350
It's over my limit that Naoki's
going to exchange wedding gifts.

532
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,840
It's the worst day of my life.

533
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,340
Mom...

534
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:01,010
I'm not trying to you make you depressed,
but there will be a wedding ceremony and a reception party.

535
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,820
No, stop it, Dad! I feel like I'm going to cry.

536
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,460
Oh, sorry, sorry.

537
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,480
Let's go, Father, Mother.

538
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,280
Okay, let's go.

539
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,670
Mother.

540
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,810
Yes, yes.

541
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,860
Boo!

542
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,710
You've waited long, Kotoko!

543
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,410
Good morning, Kin-chan.

544
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,620
-Good morning~
-Good morning.

545
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,040
Then should we go?

546
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,750
Then let's start.

547
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,380
Please treasure it for long.

548
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,130
Will do.

549
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:48,220
I'll treasure it for long.

550
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:55,110
Will do.

551
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,340
I'll treasure it for long.

552
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,380
What do you feel like eating now?

553
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,060
Hm...

554
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,430
What do you feel like?

555
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,120
-Okonomiyaki.
-Mine?
-It's been quite long to eat Kin-chan's.

556
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,310
How about a Takoyaki place I know?

557
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,940
About now, Irie is...

558
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,970
Kotoko.

559
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,610
Are you okay?

560
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,660
What about?

561
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,670
Hey, where are we going today?
I want to go to the game center again.

562
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,470
Actually there's stuffed animal that I want you to get for me.

563
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,260
It's really cute with a red hat and
there's tiny cherry attached to the hat...

564
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,450
Will you marry me?

565
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,410
What?

566
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,760
Will you get married to me?

567
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,800
How did you know about this (that I like) ?

568
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,370
I told you.

569
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,970
I know everything about you.

570
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,480
Aihara Kotoko-san,

571
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,490
please marry me!!!

572
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,680
♫ My overgrown bangs are ♫

573
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,660
♫ gently shaken by the wind ♫

574
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:12,140
♫ It's still slightly chilly ♫

575
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,440
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

576
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,040
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

577
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:25,360
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

578
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,410
♫ I realized many things ♫

579
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,940
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

580
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,810
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

581
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:42,100
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

582
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:46,260
♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

583
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:52,620
♫ your smile, and today ♫

584
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,800
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

585
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,050
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

586
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,230
♫ Above all, there's the irreplaceable time, ♫

587
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,740
♫ your smile, and surely tomorrow as well ♫

588
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,650
♫ Your memories and your future ♫

589
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,870
♫ Hold onto them tightly, so they won't be ruined ♫

590
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,090
♫ More than anyone else, ♫

591
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:30,270
♫  I always want to walk by your side ♫

592
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,800
Kin-chan proposed to you?

593
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,110
I think Kin-chan is more suitable for you than Irie if you want to know the truth.

594
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,250
It's my precious Sahoko's wedding ceremony.

595
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,170
There is no turning back anymore.

596
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,060
We can manage the restaurant together.

597
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,760
Make the best home-made dishes.

598
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,180
I want to have a restaurant that offers such dishes.

599
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,720
How many years have I had this unrequited love?

600
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,440
I grew tired of this fruitless love.

601
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,570
I will move out.

602
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,970
I feel like everything is coming to an end.

603
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,870
You both really suit each other.
