1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,950
Kotoko, look at that girl.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,190
Wh-who is that beauty?

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,160
Obviously, she's targeting for Irie.
Kotoko, you're in big trouble, now.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,030
Kin-chan?
- I work at the restaurant at night.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,140
During lunch, I'm working here at this cafeteria.
And also, I have to protect Kotoko from that evil guy.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,310
You should go join the same club with Irie.
Then you can be with him,

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,360
even if you're not in the same department as him.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,720
I've heard that you're living in the same house with him.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,560
But why don't you know anything about him?

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,030
Let's return back to our own way of living.
Just the two of us.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,760
My father said he found a nice place for us to live.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,700
So, you going to move out?

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,030
If we do... would you miss us?

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,100
It looks like I can finally go back to live in my old way.

15
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,180
I disagree!

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,940
I don't want Kotoko-chan to leave!

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,130
My darling, calm down.

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,070
But, Honey...

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,150
Thank you, Mrs. Irie.
But I've decided already.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,590
Ai-chan,

21
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,210
you don't have to feel any guilt.
We really want you to stay.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,400
You even pay us your living every month.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,660
We understand your kindness and have stayed for too long now.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm doing this for Kotoko, so she'll be able to give up on Naoki.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
No way.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,930
I will try to convince Naoki...
But Mrs. Irie.

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,960
This is the matter between them.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,710
It's not that I easily accept any girl

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,840
who comes to our house.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,990
I really love Kotoko-chan's cheerfulness...

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,670
her spirit...

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,860
and also her,

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,520
charming ways.

34
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,090
Kotoko will be very happy to hear you talk about her,

35
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,440
that way.

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,460
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,160
Big Brother.
Kotoko is going to move out!

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,740
Yes!

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,060
She caused us a lot of troubles.

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,990
Now she won't spread her germ anymore.

41
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,220
I'm so happy!
That stupid Kotoko's going to leave!

42
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,530
Ta-da! What do you think?

43
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,630
I've always wanted to have a girl.

44
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,110
I've always wished to have this type room for my girl.

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,580
It's been almost a year since we live with the Irie family.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,200
Finally my father and I,

47
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,690
decided to leave Irie's house.

48
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,540
Bye bye.

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,790
We'll see you soon, Kotoko-chan.

50
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,020
You always treated me as If I'm your own daughter, Mr. Irie...

51
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,900
Mama..

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,390
and Mrs. Irie.
- Papa.

53
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,000
And today,

54
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,940
I said good-bye to Irie-kun.

55
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,380
Everything will end now.

56
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,110
Kotoko, let's go.

57
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,530
That's it.

58
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm joking.

59
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,320
The previous resident,

60
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,450
just moved out to their new house.

61
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,090
So we going to wait for a bit to move in.

62
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,830
This is going to be our short-term apartment.

63
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,380
So why didn't we stay with the Irie's
until that family completely moved out?

64
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,380
You can't go through with it like that.

65
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,690
If we stayed any longer, it would be harder to leave.

66
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,310
So It's better to move out earlier.

67
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,710
Just only for a bit over one week.

68
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,750
A house without Irie-kun.

69
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,700
Starting today, my life will begin without Irie-kun.

[Mischievous Kiss: Love in Tokyo]

89
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,130
You moved out from Irie's house!?

90
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,540
Yes.

91
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,670
It's a short-term house until we can move to the new house.

92
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,460
I would thought you will stay in that house forever.

93
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,540
Me too.

94
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,730
But since you moved out, you're going to lose the connection between you and Irie.

95
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,130
Jinko, zip your lip!

96
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,390
I'm fine with losing it.

97
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,170
I...

98
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,670
already gave up on Irie-kun.

99
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,350
No way!!

100
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,670
You never give up even if he's being cold to you.
- I told you to zip it!

101
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,490
Now, I'm not my old self that I was anymore.

102
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,620
I'm not going to go after Irie-kun anymore.

103
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,660
I won't go to that science engineering department campus too.

104
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,170
What in the world has happened to you?

105
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,580
What my dad said was right,

106
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,420
that I still haven't realized it yet.

107
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,590
But I've seen you two for a long time now...

108
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,310
Naoki seems to have no feeling for you.

109
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,650
So I guess this plan won't work.

110
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,550
He made me reconsider a lot of things.

111
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,170
Kotoko.

112
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,110
So starting from now, I'm going to forget about everything about Irie-kun.

113
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,880
I will enjoy my new school life and...

114
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,040
find a nice boyfriend.

115
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,100
Well, here you go.
[Happy Birthday, Kotoko]

116
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,050
What's this?

117
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,010
- Kin-chan you only make it for Kotoko? It's not fair.
- She's right.

118
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,940
This is Kin-chan's special dish.

119
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,310
Kotoko is now reborn.

120
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,940
So speaking of it, today is...

121
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,220
Kotoko's new birthday.

122
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,870
Birthday!?

123
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,160
Yeah.

124
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,900
Okay!

125
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,780
Happy birthday to you!

126
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,220
Thank you, Kin-chan.

127
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,490
I will help you forget everything about Irie.

128
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,910
Cheer up, okay?

129
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,450
Happy birthday, Kotoko

130
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,390
It has already came out.

131
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,110
I'm home.

132
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,950
Let's mix it.
Then place it into the eggs! and boom!

133
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,740
And then put it into the bread crumb. And Wham!

134
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,910
Hey? What happened?

135
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,890
Where is Mom?

136
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,640
Well, she's kind of depressed.

137
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,460
She said that she has no appetite
and doesn't want to do anything.

138
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,980
She's pretty worn out.

139
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,590
She is stressed out. So I thought we should
do our share of the household chores.

140
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,470
Our share . . .

141
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,920
I haven't seen her acting like that for a long time.

142
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,590
Okay, let's move on, Yuki.

143
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,540
I'm home.

144
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,200
Welcome home!

145
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,600
I've been making your favorite dish, lasagna!

146
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,250
Oh, it's that stupid Kotoko!

147
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,810
Hey, Yuki!
Kotoko-chan, how was your school?

148
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,780
Cheers!

149
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,610
Let's have dinner.
Have a seat!

150
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,850
Welcome home.

151
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,860
No.

152
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,200
I already decided...

153
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
to forget everything about Irie-kun.

154
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,530
And I won't think of going back to the Irie's house.

155
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,470
Hey, Big Brother...
What's wrong with mom?

156
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,390
It's not

157
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,270
because that stupid Kotoko left, right?

158
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,100
Yuki, don't you have your own room?

159
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,550
Since you have it back, now you shouldn't stay here every time.

160
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,730
I know that, but it's already my habit

161
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,810
to come to your room every night.

162
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,500
Good night, then.

163
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,520
By the way...

164
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,530
If you already gave up on Irie,

165
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,470
don't go there anymore.

166
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,610
I just feel like it.

167
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,920
Alright!
Ace!

168
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,050
- Ninety-five.
- Ninety-five.

169
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,950
- Ninety-six.
Ninety-six!

170
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,250
- Ninety-seven.
- Ninety-seven.

171
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,710
Ninety-eight.

172
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,970
Ninety-nine.

173
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,240
What? Keep push.

174
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,150
One hundred.

175
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,260
You guys did well!

176
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,170
Among those members who quit...

177
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,190
you still try hard for this training.

178
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,730
I'm so proud of you all.

179
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,670
I'll reward you guys.

180
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,700
Finally, I'm going to allow . . .

181
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,790
you to be on the court today.

182
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,260
Really? Do you mean it?

183
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,910
Yes.

184
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,890
Yes!

185
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,770
Let's go! Let's go!

186
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,290
Let's go, let's go.

187
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,540
Let's go, let's go!

188
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,190
Let's go, let's go!

189
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,990
Being what? 'On the court?'
I'm just here to collect the balls.

190
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,630
Who was that?

191
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,830
So you still haven't give up yet.

192
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,900
If I were you,
I wouldn't be able to bear it until now.

193
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,280
Muscle training and collecting balls everyday.

194
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,740
Irie-kun's not even coming today.

195
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,450
I didn't do this for Irie-kun.

196
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,540
Really?

197
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,150
Go for it!

198
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,410
Why am I here to collect these balls?

199
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,850
Excuse me, you're stepping on a ball.

200
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,550
If you are a tennis player...

201
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,530
Are you still here to collect balls?

202
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,530
Irie-kun. What are you doing here?

203
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,290
Because I'm in this tennis club.

204
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,780
But you never come to practice.

205
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,860
Am I not allowed to practice or something?

206
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,500
Irie-kun? Come over here!
Let's practice together.

207
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,750
Okay, end of practicing now.

208
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,760
Next, work on your volley

209
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,710
and stroke.

210
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,970
Yes.
Let's get to work.

211
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,930
Wake up!!

212
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,160
I already decided that I'm going to forget
about him.

213
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,680
He still has no idea about my feeling.

214
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,780
I'm trying so hard to forget about you.

215
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,290
Oh, Irie!

216
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,940
Now that you came to practice.

217
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,560
Did you come here to...

218
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,570
compete with me?

219
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,630
Is that right?

220
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,470
It's fine with me.

221
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,940
But I don't want you to be embarrass again.

222
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,230
Are you sure about that?
We don't have to do it.

223
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,350
If you could offer to say it that way...

224
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,520
Could you accept any conditions that I give you and compete with me?

225
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,080
Sure, I can.

226
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,920
Well, then we will have to play doubles.

227
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,160
I will be paired with Matsumoto Yuko.
And you ...

228
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,870
will be paired with Aihara Kotoko.

229
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,770
What? Me?

230
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,770
Stop joking around.

231
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,110
Sudo must have got no pride.

232
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,410
Does he have to go that far to beat Irie?

233
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,240
What is your complaint?
Matsumoto is a freshman.

234
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,930
Aihara is also a freshman.
It's a fair combinations.

235
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,270
What's is being 'fair' about this?

236
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,720
This have already show the unfair.

237
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,610
If you could win in doubles with that kind of person, you will win the world champion.

238
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,070
Irie-kun, you don't have to go
that far.

239
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,860
He's right.

240
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,010
You said you would accept any conditions that I give up.

241
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,090
Matsumoto,

242
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,060
Aihara,

243
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,200
Get on the court.

244
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,020
I feel bad for you.
I never lose on the games.

245
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,230
Sorry about that.

246
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,300
It's impossible, right?

247
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,430
It can't be, It's impossible.

248
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,500
What do you think about this, Irie?

249
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,410
Are you going to start the game?
Or are you going to run away?

250
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:33,070
As a man, that will be so pitiful.
Isn't it, Yuko?

251
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,230
You don't need to hit the ball.

252
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,600
What?

253
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,380
Are we going to do this?

254
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,960
There is no choice.
We can't go back now.

255
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,380
Anyway, all you have to do is stand still.

256
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,860
But don't ever get in my way, you got it?

257
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,850
'Don't ever get in my way.'

258
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,960
For some reason

259
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,670
ever since high school

260
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,350
I feel I'm being told what to do by Irie-kun.

261
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,420
Service break!

262
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,360
15 - love!

263
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,800
Game!

264
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,650
owie . . .

265
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,010
ow . . .

266
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,030
Don't get in the way . . . don't get in the way
don't get in the way . . .

267
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,490
Let's move with purpose!

268
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,360
Don't get in the way . . .

269
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,110
Look out!!
-Yeow!!

270
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,320
Here it comes!

271
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,800
TAKE THIS!

272
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,660
Step aside, I'll get it!

273
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,530
Oh?!

274
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,000
Huh??

275
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,120
Game over. The winner couple is....

276
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,620
Sudo, Matsumoto.

277
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,310
Game standing, 6-2.

278
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,900
Too bad, too bad, Irie!

279
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,710
However, you guys make a good team, huh!
What say you?

280
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,960
Shall we have another go here next week?

281
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,340
Sure thing.

282
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,160
Wha~at?! Once more??

283
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,170
Are you giving up?

284
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,490
This old fart doesn't want to risk getting embarrassed.

285
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,860
Okay!

286
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,080
Alright, next week at the same time, we'll have a similar match. YEAH!

287
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,120
Oh, that's right . . . AIHARA - - -

288
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,700
Understood, understood.

289
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,110
No way!!

290
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,420
Wha~at?! You played doubles with Irie?!

291
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,800
Ah, yeah . . .

292
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,040
You don't even know how to practice tennis and yet . . .

293
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,410
Are you alright, Kotoko??

294
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,460
You even made a vow to forget Irie!!

295
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,570
How can you possibly forget him
when you're going to see his face every day?!

296
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,350
Absurd! Unthinkable! Hopeless!!

297
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,900
Honestly?

298
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,820
I haven't any confidence.

299
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,400
Of course. You two have kissed.

300
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,780
But, it is great chance for you.

301
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,530
By doing something together,
Irie might have a change of heart.

302
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,580
I don't think so.

303
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,900
There is no way that I can win against those people.

304
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,610
Not only that...

305
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,820
Irie-kun and I have done many things together.

306
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,850
He helped me with studying for the finals in high school.

307
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,880
And homework during the summer vacation.

308
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,960
But Irie-kun's feelings have never changed.

309
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,070
Right.

310
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,700
Irie has always been a heartless guy.

311
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,070
It look

312
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,090
like's it's going to be pretty tough week. Kotoko.

313
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,780
But, I can't run away from Irie-kun the rest of my life.

314
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,610
I will try my best to play tennis

315
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,740
and I'll prove that I can forget about Irie-kun.

316
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,490
Right!

317
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,550
Good job, guys!

318
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,800
Come on!

319
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,310
Let's go, let's go!

320
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,400
You're late.

321
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,500
I'm sorry.
The class was extended and...

322
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,570
I don't need to hear excuses.

323
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,200
Let's start training.

324
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,350
Wait a minute, Irie!

325
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,210
Aihara never passed the performance test, then

326
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,080
I can't allow her to practice playing tennis.
She has to collect balls.

327
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,900
But we only have one week.

328
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,990
The rules are the rules.

329
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,360
Aihara, why are you standing doing nothing?

330
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,740
- Please collect the balls!
- Yes.

331
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,100
Sudo-senpai is acting so immature.

332
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,820
He doesn't want

333
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,050
to lose the match against Irie.

334
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,470
I'm sorry, Irie-kun.

335
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,610
Let's go!

336
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,690
six, seven, eight...

337
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,450
Wow, nine...

338
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,510
What are you doing?

339
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,590
Don't close your eyes.

340
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,120
Don't look at the ground when you pick up the balls.

341
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,250
Open your eyes and look at the balls.

342
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,150
Move your body toward where the ball is coming from.

343
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,750
Understood?

344
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,400
Yes.

345
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,850
Open my eyes.

346
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,450
Look at the balls.

347
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,470
Open my eyes.

348
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,780
Look at the balls.

349
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,660
Do your best!!

350
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,500
YEAH!!

351
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,190
Good work!

352
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,790
Hurry and clean up.

353
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,140
You are going to training now.

354
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,710
I'm exhausted.

355
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,970
Like you said, I was looking at the balls and
got hit by them many times.

356
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,700
We don't have a choice since you can't train
during the club hours.

357
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,740
Now swing your racket one hundred times.

358
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,540
It's raining.

359
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,450
Keep in mind that we will practice in the morning

360
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,530
starting tomorrow.

361
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,610
It's raining.

362
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,420
Faster.

363
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,710
Bring your shoulder forward.

364
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,700
Return to the position quickly.

365
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,660
It's a rainy season.

366
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,000
Rain is not stopping!

367
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,220
Shut Up!

368
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,840
Don't talk!

369
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,670
Okay. Once more.

370
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,490
I'm home.

371
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,390
Hey Kotoko.

372
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,540
We've received fresh Rockfish, today.

373
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,450
I made stewed fish that you like.

374
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,820
Would you like some?

375
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,780
Huh?

376
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,950
You've gained a little weight lately.
You should go on the diet.

377
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,160
Eat some low fat food.

378
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,530
Low fat, huh?

379
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,430
Kin-chan.

380
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,150
What happened to Kotoko today?

381
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,400
You don't know yet, Kin-chan?

382
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,930
Kotoko is going through difficult times.

383
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,820
What? Difficult times?

384
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,590
Good morning.

385
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,570
Kin-chan.

386
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,350
I heard.

387
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,390
You've been training tennis in the morning and at night.

388
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,890
At times like this,

389
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,610
you have to eat.

390
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,280
Otherwise you will not have energy.

391
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,450
Thank you.

392
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,950
Here.

393
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,400
Thank you for the food. (Itadakimasu)

394
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,450
I'll have this.

395
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,550
It tastes good.

396
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,700
Doesn't it?

397
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,850
Hey!

398
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,970
The reason why you're working so hard
to be good at tennis is,

399
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,130
because you want to be close to Irie?

400
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,590
You.....

401
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,120
cannot forget that guy, can you?

402
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,440
He told me not to get in his way.

403
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,530
Kin-chan, you told me once,

404
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,170
about my new birthday.

405
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,940
In order to become new person,

406
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,480
I have to be independent and not to bother Irie-kun.

407
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,230
I'll be bluffing,

408
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,980
if I say I can forget Irie-kun, right now.

409
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,070
Well, who knows if I'll be able to forget or not, huh.

410
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,100
OK.

411
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,510
You're on journey to get over Irie.

412
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,560
It might take some time to forget him,

413
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,580
however, you have my support.

414
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,120
Kin-chan.

415
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,010
On the other hand,

416
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,930
I'm not giving you up.

417
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,760
You know, I'm persistent.

418
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,970
Prepare yourself.

419
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,400
Thank you, Kin-chan.

420
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,160
Why don't you have some?

421
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,850
It's delicious.

422
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,660
Here we go.

423
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,700
Again!

424
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,810
Watch your form.

425
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,120
Here.

426
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,550
Keep your eyes on the balls.

427
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,000
That's good. Once more.

428
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,390
Here.

429
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,750
Lights out.

430
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,260
Well, we have no choice,

431
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,690
let's practice your swing.

432
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,680
Imagine, this is a ball. And press forward.

433
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,150
That's good! Keep that image in your head.

434
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,980
Lift your elbow up.

435
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,980
One.
-One.

436
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,470
Two
- Two!

437
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,720
Hey, You have to pretend there is a ball there.

438
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,130
OK. I'm sorry!

439
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,820
Throw the ball higher.

440
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,050
Alright, go!

441
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,700
Swing your racket faster.

442
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,190
Again.

443
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,610
Run!
- OK!

444
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,750
Run!
- Yes.

445
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,380
Ready?
- Yes.

446
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,360
You're too slow!

447
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,120
When you go back to the spot,
you need to use the side step.

448
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,530
Yes!

449
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,480
Ready?

450
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,090
Go back!

451
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,610
Run!

452
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,500
Ah!

453
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,980
Watch the ball!

454
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,440
Run!

455
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,360
Side step back to the center.

456
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,110
Get up!

457
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,150
Get ready!

458
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,740
Okay.

459
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,570
Too slow!

460
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,650
Fast.

461
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,800
Excuse me......

462
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,970
Oh......

463
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,490
Excuse me!

464
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,850
Do you know which way to the facility
for literature department?

465
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,800
Literature Department is that way.

466
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,850
Thank you!

467
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,720
Mrs. Irie!!

468
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,830
Ma'am!!

469
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,950
Mrs. Irie!!

470
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,980
Oh my! Junko-chan, Satomi-chan.

471
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,210
I haven't seen you two in a while.

472
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,370
Why are you dressed like that?

473
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,320
That's because I don't want Naoki to find out I'm here.

474
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,130
So, I've disguised myself.

475
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,170
I think you're attracting more attention.

476
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,450
We recognized you right away.

477
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:26,150
Kotoko and you're pretty similar in that sense.

478
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,140
Kotoko-chan.

479
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,620
I haven't seen her for awhile,

480
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,740
So, I missed her so much.

481
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,750
Well... We thought that Kotoko and Irie-kun

482
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,020
might get along well.

483
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,060
I mean,

484
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,800
- they've kissed once.
-Hey, zip your lip! Zip it!!

485
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,340
Kiss?

486
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,280
You mean, KISS?

487
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,560
Yes. It's KISS.

488
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,990
They've kissed? Really?

489
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:22,210
YAHOOOOOOOOOO!

490
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,020
Wait, Mrs. Irie! Didn't you come to see Kotoko?

491
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,580
She's at Tennis court.

492
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,520
Never mind that!

493
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,870
I don't need to see her at school.

494
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,960
Because I've decided to bring Kotoko-chan back to my house.

495
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,980
What?!

496
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,930
She's trying so hard.....

497
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,960
to forget Irie-kun.

498
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,130
There's no reason for her to forget Naoki.

499
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,220
Because, they've kissed already!

500
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,220
I don't care what Naoki says.

501
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,340
I'll definitely bring Kotoko back.

502
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,090
One,

503
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,440
Two,

504
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,180
Again.

505
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,870
Life your shoulder up.
Toss one once more.

506
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,330
One,

507
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,390
You've crossed the line.
Try again.

508
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,060
One,

509
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,470
Two,

510
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,520
Where are you aiming?
Once more.

511
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,220
One, two . . .

512
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,450
Keep your eyes on the ball.

513
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,010
One, Two,

514
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,110
It's in! Yes, I did it!

515
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,100
The ball was in. Irie-kun. I did it.

516
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,120
I was able to do it for the first time.

517
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,500
Yeah!!!

518
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,530
I am sorry!

519
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,560
You know, even little kid'll be able to serve within a day.

520
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,310
I know, right?

521
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:25,220
Must be great that your life is full of 'try one more time'.

522
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,410
Huh??

523
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,190
Sometimes I'm just envious.

524
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,280
Once more.

525
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,880
Yes.

526
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,140
I'm leaving, Dad.

527
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,640
Okay, have a good day!!

528
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,600
Oh! Kotoko!! Wait a moment!
-Ok, ok!

529
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,470
Yes?
-Um . . .

530
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,430
Ah,

531
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,960
today, we're moving into the new house.

532
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,870
Oh, yeah, we were, weren't we.

533
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,800
Don't make a mistake and come here.
It's the new house, get it?

534
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,280
Don't worry! Besides, didn't we go to see it together?
-Yep.

535
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,330
Okay, I'm off!

536
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,520
OK, be safe.

537
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,640
Wonder if it'll really be okay?

538
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,020
Heave ho . . . something like that.

539
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,270
Kin-chan.

540
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,360
Hey! Kotoko . . .

541
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,460
are you alright?

542
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,840
Yeah, I'm alright.

543
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:45,860
Kotoko, you've really tried your best till today, haven't you?

544
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,290
You have Tennis match

545
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,720
after school, right?

546
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,340
Yup.

547
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,720
I made these to wish you'd win.

548
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,900
Katsu-sandwich.
(Katsu=Breaded fried chicken or pork, also means "win")

549
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,240
Katsu-sandwich!

550
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,780
Kin-chan. Thank you so much!

551
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,500
How can you be so relaxed?

552
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,860
Even eating katsu sandwiches?

553
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,360
This is for good luck.

554
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,000
If those superstitions actually worked,
no one would lose the game.

555
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,410
Hey,

556
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,780
do you know how much trouble
you are causing Irie-kun?

557
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,980
I'm putting in all my effort to
avoid giving him troubles.

558
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,490
And the effort you are putting in
is already a trouble.

559
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,020
In the last game and
today's game...

560
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,810
Irie-kun is the one who
gets humiliated.

561
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:06,040
And he is wasting his time
because of your training.

562
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,680
You are giving the man
you love so much trouble...

563
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,520
How can you not feel bad about it?

564
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,090
Smooth.

565
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,590
We'll serve!!

566
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,930
Listen. Don't let a whole week of
your effort go to waste.

567
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,570
Make sure to open your eyes and
follow the direction of the ball.

568
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,000
Got it?

569
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,420
Yes.

570
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,910
You are not alone.

571
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,290
I'm with you.
So don't be scared.

572
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,850
Okay.

573
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,140
Sudo, Matsumoto team. Serve.

574
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,520
Damn, she is hitting every single ball.
Even my super fast balls . . . that beginner!

575
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,570
But she can't hit it back to this side.

576
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,610
They will succumb to us for sure.

577
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,720
This is a matter of my pride.

578
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,570
Forget about Irie. It's Aihara.

579
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,440
Just focus on Aihara.

580
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,580
Yes.

581
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,310
Open your eyes.
Look at the ball.

582
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,030
Move your body toward where
the ball is coming from.

583
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,590
I'm not scared of looking
at the ball anymore.

584
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,270
Plus compared to Irie-kun's serves...

585
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,900
Sudo-san's and Matsumoto-san's
are much slower.

586
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,680
That's why...

587
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,680
Alright, Aihara...

588
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,980
Take this.

589
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,860
- Kotoko.
- Yes!

590
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,470
I can see it.

591
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
That serve was in!

592
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,680
Wasn't that Matsumoto's error?

593
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,300
Aihara, that was terrific!

594
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,750
You did it.

595
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,870
It got away.

596
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,260
It's the first . . . the first ball to get away.

597
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,240
It's the first since I came our from my mother's womb.

598
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,990
Ouch!

599
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,250
OUCH!!

600
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,310
Did you sprain your foot?

601
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,320
Hoo boy, you're really hopeless.

602
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,700
Is it here?
-YEOUCH!!

603
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,280
This is bad, alright.

604
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,150
Sudo-san, our side will default.

605
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,050
Wha - wha - what?!

606
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,950
You're okay with defaulting??

607
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,020
Please take my racket.

608
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:55,330
Um, I'm sorry that it was my fault that we lost.

609
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,540
I'm not so low as to think like that.

610
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,920
Oh?!

611
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,050
God.

612
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,800
If I would say 'I like you' more and more

613
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,820
would you get angry?

614
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,730
Are we still not at your house?

615
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,560
Hm, that's odd.

616
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,200
When we came to look it over, it was close to the train station.

617
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,820
Probably, it was just a little bit farther.

618
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,590
You said that before, too!

619
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,690
That's why I suggested we should take a taxi.

620
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,690
But that's wasteful.

621
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,590
Either way something would come of it.

622
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,110
You're right.

623
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,310
You know what, Irie-kun?

624
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,710
At the time of the tennis challenge
when I hit Sudo-san's serve . . .

625
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,440
you called out my name, didn't you?

626
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,220
I wonder . . .

627
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,720
Your calling it out was a first, right?

628
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,910
I really don't remember it.

629
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,660
I was so engrossed with the game.

630
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,590
Oh! There it is!!

631
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,760
My new home!!

632
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,400
It's my home.

633
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,300
I'll leave you in your father's care.

634
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,860
Hey, wait a second!

635
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:50,000
Um, I think Dad is still at home,

636
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,770
would you want to have a cup of tea?

637
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,150
Look, Dad

638
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,570
would be very happy to see you I think.

639
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,130
- And I would like to...
- Understood, I understood already.

640
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:00,460
So let me go.

641
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,410
Sorry.

642
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:14,700
Yes.

643
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,700
Oh, Dad!

644
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,440
Your grandpa?

645
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,250
I don't know him.

646
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,010
Uhm, who are you?

647
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,090
That's rude.

648
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,920
And who are you?

649
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,950
I am from this house.

650
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,130
This

651
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,440
is my house.

652
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,490
That can't be.

653
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,520
But I think I'm correct here.

654
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,810
I was here once.

655
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:49,250
Anyways, this is my residence.

656
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,130
Huh?

657
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,760
What?

658
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,850
♫ My overgrown bangs are ♫

659
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,120
♫ gently shaken by the wind ♫

660
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,350
♫ It's still slightly chilly ♫

661
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:17,110
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

662
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:20,460
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

663
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:25,760
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

664
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,880
♫ I realized many things ♫

665
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:34,250
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

666
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,050
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

667
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:42,350
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

668
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:46,620
♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

669
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,950
♫ your smile, and today ♫

670
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,020
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

671
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:01,380
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

672
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,650
♫ Above all, there's the irreplaceable time, ♫

673
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,070
♫ your smile, and surely tomorrow as well ♫

674
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,010
♫ Your memories and your future ♫

675
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:18,290
♫ Hold onto them tightly, so they won't be ruined ♫

676
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,460
♫ More than anyone else, ♫

677
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:29,820
♫  I always want to walk by your side ♫

678
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,550
What are you saying?

679
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,920
You already kissed.

680
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,310
Kissed?!

681
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,380
Please date the older brother.

682
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,240
That's your mission.

683
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,350
You are going to secretly monitor Irie's date?!

684
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,030
We should start working together, and help each other out.
What do you think?

685
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,690
Handsome!

686
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,400
I don't want Kotoko to see

687
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,870
a disgusting thing!

688
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,040
Wouldn't we make a really good couple?

689
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,910
Probably.

690
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,930
You don't hate me?

691
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,130
It's my weak point, but I don't hate you.
