1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,620
I'm really happy that all three of us got accepted into Tonan University.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,450
Congratulations!

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,000
I think your parents would be happy if you went to Tokyo University.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,330
Really...

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,950
Nothing good has ever happened to me since I met you.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,100
Hey, are you okay?

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,530
What about the test?

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,430
What about Todai?

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,820
However, I didn't take the test.

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,990
- What?
- I'm really sorry!

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,680
It's my daughter's fault

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,050
that your precious son is in such trouble.

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,360
Let me tell you this,

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,340
It's not your fault that I couldn't take the exam for Todai.

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,100
It's not too bad to stay here and move on

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,430
to the university without having taken an exam.

17
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,330
In order to go to the same university as me?

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,640
Not really.

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,880
That's not the reason.

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,950
After going through many twists and turns,

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,850
in the end Irie-kun

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,900
got accepted into Tonan University just like me.

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,150
March.

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,700
After spending three years in Tonan HIgh School
came the final day.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,600
That's right.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,180
Graduation day was drawing near.

27
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,700
As you know, graduation is in eight days.

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,450
Slowly, it is time to say goodbye to everyone

29
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,360
who went to this high school together.

30
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,400
What's the matter? Where's your pep?

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,490
Hey, what's wrong, F-class?

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,390
Now the exam is over.

33
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,680
We're finally able to enjoy the school life.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,010
Well, most people here will go to other universities.

35
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,650
It's sad to part with everyone.

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,640
You don't have to mind me.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,030
I'm the only one staying here, right?

38
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,450
Well.

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,470
Sorry.

40
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,970
But, is it really okay?

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,610
Well, if I'll feel like I want to go to Todai later on,

42
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,390
I can just apply next year.

43
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,910
That's true, isn't it?

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,070
If it's you, that's possible.

45
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,840
I know you got into Waseda University,

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,150
Congrats.

47
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,990
Thank you!

48
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,930
Is Irie-kun really going to our school's university?

49
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,240
I'm a little shocked.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,780
There's a rumor that he didn't take the Todai exam on purpose.

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,140
Why?

52
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,900
No way, could it be because of the Class-F girl?

53
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,050
It's finally graduation time for us too?

54
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,840
You have to create an excellent memory with Irie-kun as well.

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,240
Well, since we'll go to the same university ...

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,990
What are you saying there?!
It's your last time in high school.

57
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,160
This is great opportunity to get close to him.

58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,100
Because this woman is going to our school's university,

59
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,200
Irie-kun did the same, I heard.

60
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,970
Everyone is talking only about that.

61
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,540
Unbelievable!

62
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,740
What part of that woman is so good?

63
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,570
I know, right?

64
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,550
You could be united on graduation day!

65
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,700
Oh, so embarrassing.

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,100
Does this that mean ...

67
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,180
Kiss?

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,100
That's good!

69
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,710
On graduation day, you could have

70
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,430
your first kiss.

71
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,580
Oh, stop it, that's impossible.

72
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,690
Did you know?

73
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,350
Our school's legend.

74
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,040
A couple that kisses on graduation day

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,070
will stay together forever.

76
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,200
Is that really true?

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,830
I heard that too.

78
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,000
I think it's too much of a task for Kotoko.

79
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,400
That's true!

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,240
That's right, isn't it?
Kiss . . . a kiss!

81
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,080
First kiss.

82
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,450
The first in my life...

83
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,490
That special thing that can only happen only once ...

84
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,650
Kiss.

85
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,300
At that time, I had longed for such a long time...

86
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,150
my first kiss.

87
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,250
Surely what...

88
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,400
would that be like?

89
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,040

Mischevious Kiss: Love in TOKYO

108
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,450
What are you going to wear for graduation party?

109
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,620
Episode 5
Who Will be My First Kiss!?

110
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,050
That's right.

111
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,680
The ones in charge of the teacher-appreciation party are you three, right?

112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,140
Yes, we haven't decided on a store yet, but

113
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,220
please come for sure, teacher.

114
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,400
Of course!

115
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,760
You three have worked really hard.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,950
Congratulations on graduating.

117
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,220
Thank you so much.

118
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,540
All of us from the F-class are able to graduate.

119
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,990
I'm totally happy!

120
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,190
We'll have the best graduation and teacher appreciation celebration! Right, Teacher?

121
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,930
Of course
Yep.

122
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,610
But, also..

123
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,490
There is one fella who might not graduate.

124
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,390
Huh?

125
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,610
You hadn't heard about Ikezawa Kinnosuke?

126
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,430
Kin-chan?

127
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,490
Speaking of which . . .

128
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,490
He wasn't here today, right?

129
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,490
No way, Kin-chan can't graduate?

130
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,830
Hey,

131
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,610
no way, no way.

132
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,760
If it's him, it might be possible.

133
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,120
I mean, he could graduate.
Graduating...

134
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,840
is possible, but...

135
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,280
Kin-chan,

136
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,360
Kotoko...

137
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
How did you know I was here?

138
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,210
I asked Gintaro-kun and Dozo-kun.

139
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,490
I told those guys not to open their yap.

140
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,100
Kin-chan,

141
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,610
let's graduate together.

142
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,400
Gintaro-kun and Dozo-kun are worried as well.

143
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,570
You heard from them, right.

144
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,010
That I cannot go to our school's university.

145
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,750
Yeah.

146
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,300
But,

147
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,950
there is another person like that in our class.

148
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,500
Gintaro-kun is going to Technical school, right?

149
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,950
I...

150
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,780
I thought I'll try to do something big,

151
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,030
when I came from Osaka to Tokyo.

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
What big thing do you want to do?

153
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,250
I don't know yet.

154
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,970
I care but,

155
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,450
life is a one-time thing.

156
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,530
A man should do something big,

157
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,260
To get the best wife,

158
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,080
and have the best family.

159
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,950
Because of that,

160
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,060
I came to the largest city in Japan.

161
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,590
I'm alone here in Tokyo.

162
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,770
But despite that,

163
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,900
that punk Irie,

164
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,830
I'm ashamed to look him in the face.

165
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,660
Irie-kun...

166
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,800
That's right, isn't it?

167
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,070
I told him, "I love Kotoko more than anything in the world".

168
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,610
But, I couldn't get into any universities.

169
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,970
Irie, that punk,

170
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,240
gave up on Todai

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,570
to go to the same school as you.

172
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,490
That's not exactly...

173
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,030
how it happened, but...

174
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,050
It seems that I'm always losing to him.

175
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,450
I feel so pathetic.

176
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,460
Life isn't only about a university.

177
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,400
Hey,

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,560
I told you before, right.

179
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,950
My dad, and Irie-kun's dad are best friends.

180
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,710
Even though,

181
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,200
Irie-kun's dad graduated from Todai (Tokyo University).

182
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,450
Yes, yes.
Absolutely!

183
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,850
Wunderbar! (Wonderful!)

184
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,670
He founded a company,

185
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,920
He made this company so successful all by himself.

186
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,680
Bravissimo！(Best!)

187
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,530
Ciao!

188
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,460
Compared to my dad, who didn't even go to high school.

189
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,010
He went to work straight away
right after middle school.

190
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,250
You already know that, right?

191
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,110
But, even so, those two get along really well.

192
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,550
They acknowledge their differences, and respect each other.

193
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,610
If.....

194
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,950
he didn't take you guys in,

195
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,740
you'll be homeless.

196
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,690
I know right?

197
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,370
What I'm saying is

198
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,080
were both not good at studying, but...

199
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,790
We should look for something we are good at doing.

200
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,850
Something I am good at...?

201
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,470
Yep.

202
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,810
Wouldn't it be good
if you could find a great thing that only you are able to do.

203
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,800
Hey,

204
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,880
if I was able to find that,

205
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,690
will you come to love me?

206
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,470
That's another thing.

207
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,700
But,

208
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,940
That guy, Irie said that,

209
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,980
"You never know what will happen."

210
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,720
"You hate someone today, but you might like them tomorrow."

211
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,250
I don't hate you, Kin-chan...

212
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,850
But, I can't think of you as anyone but a friend.

213
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,810
That's the situation today.

214
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,330
I will definitely find my speciality.

215
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,610
Turn that into my work.

216
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,940
I'm going to succeed.

217
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,670
Just wait, Kotoko.

218
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,240
So, what about graduation?

219
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,320
Well,

220
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm going to attend with my head held high.

221
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,450
School marks are not the only thing to determine a man's worth.

222
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,600
I will definitely not lose to Irie,

223
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,810
I definitely will succeed!

224
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,300
Let's have an awesome graduation, won't we?

225
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,620
Yep.

226
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,450
Let's make good memories.

227
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,630
Would you like to order?

228
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,500
Mandhely Coffee, please.

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,870
Okay.

230
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,600
It's Mandheling. (Indonesian coffee beans)

231
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,800
Kotoko.

232
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,150
Hmm?

233
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,500
What is it?

234
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,860
It's lonely.

235
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,800
Yep, lonely.

236
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
Lonely.

237
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,690
It can't be helped.

238
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,020
Hey.

239
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,250
Kin-chan is back!

240
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,100
Bro!

241
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,370
Kin-chan are you okay?

242
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,660
Of course I'm okay.

243
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,630
But, university?

244
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,370
Jinko, be quiet.

245
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,560
No, no, no

246
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,260
I am one step ahead of you guys.

247
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,660
I've decided to become adult faster than everyone else.

248
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,010
So I can tell her.....

249
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,230
"Come on, Kotoko"

250
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,130
Something like that.

251
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,150
You mean, you'll work instead of going to University.

252
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,800
Yep.

253
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,950
Kin-chan, you're optimistic.

254
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,500
Or he's just a carefree person?

255
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,420
It's okay, finally Kin-chan is in the mood to graduate.

256
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,540
Yes.

257
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,830
Rather than that, what about you?

258
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,850
You guys are in charge of the graduation party, right?

259
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,750
That's true, huh?

260
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,010
We still haven't decided where we'll hold party, yet.

261
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,490
It'll be difficult to choose with our limited budget.

262
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,250
Butalian? (Pig Italian) Absolutely not!
This restaurant is so cheesy.

263
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,360
Let me help you with the party.

264
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,040
It's going to be a best party ever!!

265
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,240
What shall we do?

266
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,960
Well...

267
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,850
You know your food.

268
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,210
It's not only food.

269
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,770
Kin-chan, thanks, you save us.

270
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,320
Everyone in class F,

271
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,150
on the last night of high school,

272
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,370
will be the best!!

273
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,250
You guys....

274
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,750
Wash your face and wait. (Be prepare!)

275
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,360
It's neck, not face.

276
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,350
Yeah, it is neck.

277
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,560
Be prepare!

278
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,160
Yeah!

279
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,060
Face, too.

280
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,800
Let's wash our faces, too.

281
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,780
You guys, make sure wash your face, OK?

282
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,890
GRADUATION DAY

283
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,570
Wonderful, Kotoko-chan!

284
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,750
Smile more.

285
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,050
Yes, right.

286
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,980
Look up!

287
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,790
Think of this camera as Naoki.

288
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,170
Go stand behind the couch.

289
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,840
How about something like this?

290
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,220
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,280
Yes, I'll take, cheese.

292
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,630
Sweet.

293
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,280
Sit here for the next one.

294
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,970
Lean across the couch.

295
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,440
Yes, yes, yes.

296
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,450
I'll take it.

297
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,640
Ah, so sweet.

298
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,660
Good angle!!

299
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,250
This is the last time

300
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,880
I can see Kotoko's uniform.

301
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,350
Dad, stop . . .

302
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,870
Let's take some outside too.

303
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,450
Hey,

304
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,070
it's your graduation day,

305
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,670
let's take a celebratory picture of Kotoko-chan and Naoki together.

306
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,450
It's impossible, me and...

307
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,750
like this...

308
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,740
Let's take it.

309
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,100
Huh?

310
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,130
Kotoko-chan, your chance!

311
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,860
Quick, quick!

312
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,740
OK.

313
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,970
Ok, I'll take it.

314
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,380
A little closer.

315
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,020
Quickly.

316
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,820
More, more.

317
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,550
Yes, that's it.

318
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,470
Wonderful!

319
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,700
You've got bread crumbs.

320
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,580
It's the last time, let's go together.

321
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,450
However,

322
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,540
the days have gone by fast, haven't they?

323
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,620
Today our high school life ends already.

324
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,540
But,

325
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,160
out of these three years, the last one was the best.

326
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,450
In my 18 years,

327
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,300
this last one was the hardest.

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,790
They're together today as well.

329
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,690
Is that okay, bro?

330
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,720
This guy,

331
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,950
he gave up on Todai because of Kotoko.

332
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,840
Kotoko is such a good girl.

333
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,160
Irie is really something.

334
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,510
Well, a powerful enemy

335
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:19,330
makes it perfect.

336
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,180
I......

337
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,130
have a great plan.

338
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,010
A plan?

339
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,520
After the graduation party,

340
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,450
Kotoko and I.....

341
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,730
We're going to Chu Chu. (Kiss)

342
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,970
Chu-Chu?

343
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,350
Chu-Chu.

344
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,190
Are you going to kiss her?

345
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,300
You're too loud!

346
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
We're sorry.

347
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,400
Kiss?

348
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,820
Shut up! Shut up!

349
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,920
Shut up.

350
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,150
Let's go.

351
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,590
You guys,

352
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,650
do you know the school legend?

353
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,210
Legend?

354
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,510
The couple that kisses

355
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,050
on the day of graduation,

356
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,690
will be together forever.

357
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,670
Yes, yes.
That's why you want to kiss...

358
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,470
Right.

359
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,140
Then I will be close to Kotoko forever.

360
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,400
Forever, how are you going to do that?

361
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,920
It's impossible. Impossible.

362
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm not going to force her.

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,850
Then how?

364
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,150
I.....

365
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,810
have a special strategy.

366
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,930
strategy?

367
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,710
Is he alright?

368
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,150
To Kotoko, Love shock!!!

369
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,880
Your voice is too loud.

370
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,950
Wait.

371
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,750
Presenting the Graduation Certificate.

372
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,590
This certifies that Irie Naoki,

373
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,780
has successfully completed course of study

374
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,690
approved by this High School.

375
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,750
Congratulation!

376
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,380
Aihara Kotoko.

377
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,380
Komori Jinko.

378
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,500
Ishikawa Satomi.

379
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,620
Ikezawa Kinnosuke.

380
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,900
Kin-chan!

381
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,440
Kin-chan!

382
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,330
They went by really fast,

383
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:56,410
these months and years.

384
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:05,590
Now is the time to part,

385
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:14,290
well then.

386
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,450
Now our high school life is over, right?

387
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,940
Kotoko-chan!

388
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,200
Isn't that Irie-kun's mum?

389
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,120
Mrs. !

390
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,500
Mrs. ! Thank you so much for today!

391
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,290
Congratulations on your graduation!

392
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,890
The dads were also here, but left earlier because of work.

393
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,720
That's fine.

394
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,290
Dad has surely cried a lot.

395
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,890
If I saw that,

396
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,750
I would feel like crying again.

397
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,250
Of course, it's the graduation ceremony of his only daughter.

398
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,840
Me too, my tears...

399
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:13,270
Kotoko seems to be a real part of the Irie family.

400
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,550
Of course!

401
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,200
I still haven't given up on Kotoko-chan

402
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,510
marrying into our family.

403
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,460
Look at this!

404
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,370
The feeling of a graduation ceremony.

405
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,070
Indeed, Mrs. understands it.

406
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,390
A life with love in it is wonderful.

407
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,730
There too!

408
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,520
If you would like.

409
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,240
The second button!

410
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,720
Wow, I remember my youth.

411
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,950
Well, our uniform only has two buttons.

412
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,950
But receiving a button from someone is a happy thing.

413
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,060
Like graduating from life.

414
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,260
How nice, I'm jealous.

415
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,120
Hey, Kotoko-chan.

416
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,980
Are you in a position to complain like this?

417
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,220
You are graduating too.

418
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,210
You have to be strong and attack Naoki.

419
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,240
Huh?

420
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,970
That's right, it comes from Irie-kun's mom.

421
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,230
You have to be strong.

422
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,870
Well, but.

423
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,300
And by chance...

424
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,270
but somehow your beloved one seems to be quite troubled.

425
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,040
Senpai, please give me your second button.

426
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,820
I refuse.

427
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,960
Senpai, please take a graduation picture with me.

428
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,260
I refuse.

429
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,160
Sorry, sorry.

430
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,130
Irie-kun had that many fans.

431
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,430
Not everyone is like Kotoko,

432
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,680
confessing like that.
It's impossible, they just don't do it.

433
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,020
Today is the last day, that's why these girls went crazy.

434
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,870
Like I expected.

435
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,650
Mhh?

436
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,730
Naoki really has feelings for Kotoko-chan.

437
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,230
That's why he's defending his second button, it's for you!

438
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,300
Ah no, that can't be.

439
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,770
I'm the mother of this child.

440
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,930
I know the feelings of this child as if they were in my hands.

441
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Kotoko, go!

442
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,760
Huh?

443
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,180
It's the last time in high school!

444
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,100
Right, the last memory!

445
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,070
Go!

446
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,850
Go!

447
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,220
Go!

448
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,250
Go!

449
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,700
If,

450
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,490
I'd receive Irie-kun's second button now...

451
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,640
Uhm, Irie-kun,

452
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,530
congratulations on your graduation.

453
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,320
Uhm, if you'd like to give your second button...

454
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,730
Alright.

455
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,030
Huh?

456
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,330
He did it!

457
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,060
Does this mean

458
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,740
that I am Irie-kun's

459
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,350
special person?

460
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,660
Ouch.

461
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,160
Irie-kun.

462
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,030
Huh? Button, the button.

463
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,230
Uhm, Irie-kun.

464
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,490
Uhm, if you'd like to give your second button...

465
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,460
I refuse.

466
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,390
Sorry, Kotoko-chan, sorry.

467
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,790
Even when graduating,

468
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,490
his hate for women doesn't change?

469
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,430
Your love life might suffer.

470
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,810
Your yakisoba skills are unique on this earth.

471
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,890
Without doubt you will receive Kotoko-chan's heart.

472
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,220
Of course.

473
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,240
Without mistake.

474
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,360
Alright, looks good.

475
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,570
This is bothering right, what shall we do with it?

476
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,090
Ah, usually you'd use another type for graduation.

477
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,830
But it was full of people everywhere,
I couldn't find anything except this one.

478
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,710
Because it's graduation season.

479
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,670
But still, this room is the largest.

480
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,130
We have some

481
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,050
of your yakisoba, right?

482
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,930
Yes, Yakisoba. Put it into the middle.

483
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,170
Put it into the middle.

484
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,430
Alright.

485
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:48,630
But the greatest weapon is this.

486
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,430
I understand.

487
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,930
In this stage your true self is hidden.

488
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,100
Indeed, Gintaro.

489
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,090
Aren't you talking too early?

490
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,750
What is it? What?

491
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,850
You're like a dictator.

492
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,300
Do you remember what we've talked about?

493
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,800
Bro's and sister Kotoko's...

494
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,420
Ah, kiss.

495
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,910
The expectation is high.

496
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,320
And don't say it, it's embarassing.

497
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,970
It's embarassing. Embarassing.

498
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,060
Embarassing.
Bro's embarassed.

499
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:28,060
No matter how the seasons change,
the heart of girls can be won in the same way.

500
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,840
That is

501
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,380
singing, yeah.

502
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,820
It is

503
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,020
a song.

504
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,270
Microphone check.

505
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,150
I will dedicate the best love song to Kotoko.

506
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,330
Then Kotoko will fall for me instantly.

507
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,370
Kin-chan!

508
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,010
Sorry for the past.

509
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,670
Without noticing you,

510
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,720
I liked such a despicable guy.

511
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,520
I am an idiot.

512
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,340
Don't cry.

513
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,730
- What's going on?
- A song?

514
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,470
Kin-chan, sorry to keep you waiting!

515
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,850
What? It was at the best part!

516
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,250
The yakisoba noodles looks so good!

517
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,100
Thanks!

518
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,480
Can we start eating?

519
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,430
Yes, go ahead. I prepared the best for tonight!

520
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,780
Thank you!

521
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,670
Let's eat!

522
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,450
Let's eat the yakisoba noodles!

523
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,680
Oh!...

524
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,050
Kin-chan's yakisoba is the best!

525
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,170
- Right?

526
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,900
Kotoko, you have seaweed on your face.

527
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,760
Irie-kun...

528
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,910
Is it Class F?

529
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,760
Why is Class F here?

530
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,250
What?

531
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,530
Are you the ones who are using that side of the room?

532
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,770
Oh, look...

533
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,540
(Goodbye Class F, see you again!)
-Hello everyone...

534
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,140
We would like to start Tonan High School,
senior year, Class F's teacher-appreciation party.

535
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,330
There are many drinks...

536
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,670
and I did my best ...

537
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,160
to cook a lot of delicious food.

538
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,040
So please enjoy chatting.

539
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,390
It looks so delicious.

540
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,910
- It is sparkling!

541
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,060
- What kind of food is it?

542
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,710
Isn't it Chinese?

543
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,530
- Chinese? oh...

544
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,530
- Chinese...

545
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,110
- Oh...

546
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,960
What? what? what?

547
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,250
What is going on?

548
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,980
This is delicious.

549
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,550
The food is from Robuchon in Evisu.

550
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,350
That famous Robuchon?

551
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,470
My father is a good friend of their chef.

552
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,600
Amazing!

553
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,050
That's impresive, Watanabe.

554
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,320
It's nothing.

555
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,130
Even in a situation like this, there
is a difference between Class A and Class F.

556
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,020
Really.

557
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,500
This yakisoba is so good.

558
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,190
This sausage is tasty too.

559
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,940
Right, everyone?

560
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,450
I will eat this grilled chicken!

561
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,230
That's right!

562
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,250
Le's eat!

563
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,420
An octopus ball made by Kin-chan!

564
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,250
Kin-chan...

565
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,350
you are the best!

566
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,380
Well... uh...

567
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,930
The most important part of this party is...

568
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,280
not us, or the food...

569
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,350
but our teacher.

570
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,120
Mr. Shibukawa...

571
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,520
For the past three years...

572
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,090
thank you very much for taking care of us.

573
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,420
Please come on up and say something.

574
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,610
Um... everyone from Class F....

575
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,760
Congratulations on your graduation.

576
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,940
I'm sure there were people who looked
down on you since you are in Class F.

577
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,060
But...

578
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,780
you never let them get you down.

579
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,300
The three years that I fought with you...

580
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,820
I...

581
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,910
I'm proud of it.

582
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,810
For three years...

583
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:13,470
I could be the teacher for smart students like yourselves...

584
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,870
I consider myself a lucky man.

585
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,690
Waseda, Keio, Jochi ...

586
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,590
I can't count how many of you...

587
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,280
entered prestigious schools.

588
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,890
I'm so proud of you.

589
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,970
The reason we could have such excellent score was...

590
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,680
because we had an excellent teacher who taught us.

591
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,380
You are good with compliments.

592
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,550
I want to say this loud and proud...

593
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,990
Yes!

594
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,200
You shouldn't be studying when you are young.

595
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,900
Academic performance...

596
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,080
is not the only way to measure a person!

597
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,510
Yeah!

598
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,690
A student that scores low on test has a difficult time entering college...

599
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,180
and has a difficult time finding a job.

600
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,470
All of you are so important to me.

601
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,350
I am truly glad that you don't have to...

602
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:32,460
go through such difficulties.

603
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,050
Hey!

604
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,600
Just because they are a little smarter,
who do you think you are?

605
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,100
Hmm?

606
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,530
I never mentioned anything about you folks in Class F.

607
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,610
Did my speech pinch any nerves for you?

608
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,170
Oh gosh...

609
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,270
People in the low-lever class are always paranoid.

610
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,580
What the hell did you say?

611
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,550
...And always turn to violence immediately.

612
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,740
What?

613
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,270
I haven't done anything.

614
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,830
The use of verbal violence can be exposed to criminal liability.

615
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,720
After all, the only way people from Class F can fight us...

616
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,560
is with muscles.

617
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,150
Kin-chan...

618
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,790
Kin-chan!

619
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,940
Kobayakawa, well done.

620
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,360
Sir, thank you very much.

621
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,800
All other rooms are reserved tonight.

622
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,360
Please make it work for us. I'm begging you!

623
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,490
This is the last night of our high school lives.

624
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,070
We can't enjoy it if we are next to those people.

625
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,650
but we can't help you with that.

626
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,850
Kin-chan...

627
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,230
Kotoko, we are going to get a different room.

628
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,310
I already said...

629
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,920
The room we have now is fine.

630
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,000
Let's go, Kin-chan.

631
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,630
But, Kotoko...

632
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,050
The teachers lost their tempers because they are drunk.

633
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,450
Let's get along since this is the last night.

634
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,380
We made a promise...

635
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,400
That we should find something...

636
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,160
we are good at.

637
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,760
Then we wouldn't care about ...

638
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,930
whatever people from Class A say to us, right?

639
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,940
You're right!

640
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,560
I...

641
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,510
got all excited.

642
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,250
Thank you for reminding me.

643
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,110
Kotoko

644
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,800
You have seaweed on your lips.

645
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,420
Brother, finally!
Shhh!!

646
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,700
Irie Naoki!

647
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,460
Well then, I will go back first.

648
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,660
What are you doing, Mr. Genius?

649
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,500
Are you worried about Kotoko and I?

650
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,530
Are you jealous?

651
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,990
Hey! I'm talking to you.

652
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,330
While you are in the university slacking,

653
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,890
I'll work hard and become successful.

654
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,980
I made a promise with Kotoko.

655
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,700
Hearing from someone

656
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,220
who couldn't make it to University.

657
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,740
It sounds like sour grapes, doesn't it.

658
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,770
The promise I made with Kotoko, it's not just that.

659
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,100
Tonight, I will kiss Kotoko.

660
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,410
To kiss.

661
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,070
Dream on.

662
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,180
I wonder?

663
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,560
Kotoko was the one who invited me.

664
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,840
At the end of high school,

665
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,920
She finally realized,

666
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,050
who loves her the most.

667
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,810
It's too late for you to be jealous.

668
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,120
Mr. Genius.

669
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,930
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

670
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,270
Everyone in Class A and

671
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,860
everyone in Class F

672
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,360
Let's have a good time!

673
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,780
It is the last night of high school.

674
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,230
Let's put the food together.

675
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,540
Since we don't have much.

676
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,660
That's a great idea.

677
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,160
Let's do it.

678
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,400
Everyone, please come over here.

679
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,610
You're the lucky one,

680
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,560
You got your wish.

681
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,340
Irie-kun couldn't go to Todai,

682
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,750
because of you.

683
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,630
Just because you're stupid,
doesn't mean you can drag someone down with you.

684
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,880
You're the worst.

685
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,850
It wasn't her fault.

686
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:11,890
It wasn't her fault that I didn't go to Todai.

687
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,560
Irie-kun!

688
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,800
It's great that you're standing up for her.

689
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,400
You're better person than I thought.

690
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,690
Why would I stop going to Todai for the likes of her?

691
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,160
The likes of me??

692
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,990
Are you alright? Kotoko.

693
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,360
Are you hurt?

694
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,170
I think he's right.

695
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,850
Someone like him, so smart

696
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,750
will not be persuaded by just a girl.

697
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,040
That would be the biggest mistake of his life.

698
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,580
Just a girl . . .?

699
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,300
As I thought,

700
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,190
There's no way he'll fall in love with such a girl.

701
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,530
It was stupid of me to believe those rumors.

702
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,050
Such a girl?

703
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,040
Wait a minute!

704
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:09,240
Why are you calling me as stupid, annoying, such a girl?

705
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,260
Don't you think you've been bit too harsh?

706
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,180
It's true that he's been taking care of me,

707
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,910
I might be a little nuisance to him.

708
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,190
A little??

709
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,330
Maybe, a lot......

710
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,250
I think so, too.

711
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,700
But, why are you talking to me like that?
You cold-hearted man!

712
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:35,010
But you like that Cold-Hearted man.

713
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,250
Alright, you guys need to chill.

714
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,280
So what you're saying, how great the power of her love.

715
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,420
Irie and Kotoko-chan meant to be together.

716
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,860
You've got to be kidding!

717
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,030
You had a lucky charm,

718
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:52,840
What are you talking about?

719
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,950
This is funny stor....

720
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,540
but, Irie fell down the stair because of that lucky charm.

721
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,000
I remember.....

722
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,760
he was on crutches.

723
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,560
He missed his train.

724
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,520
All his pencils had broken leads.

725
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,640
He couldn't even eat his lunch.

726
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,860
That's not lucky, it's curse!

727
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,480
No, no, no. That's power of love.

728
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,930
Side effect from that power of love.

729
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:22,100
I also remember that very next day
she gave Irie-kun love letter,

730
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,430
her house collapsed!

731
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,120
He didn't accept the letter, either.

732
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,280
I don't want it!

733
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,750
That's amazing!

734
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,290
She can create quite a storm.

735
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,030
Have you ever received gift in Valentine's Day?

736
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,320
Yeah, Damn one.

737
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,440
She also gave me stupid head massage thing for new year.

738
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,610
That's too funny.

739
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,620
You have no taste.

740
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,990
These are really funny stories about her.

741
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,250
Who's next?

742
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,440
Oh no, I think she's gone mad.

743
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,980
Kotoko. Are you ok?

744
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,210
Kotoko?

745
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:17,460
Ah~! This is real fun. Funny stuff!

746
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,080
You've got some nerve.

747
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,380
What are you talking about?

748
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,350
Do you think I'm the only one with a funny story?

749
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:40,970
I have never done anything that
I would be ashamed of in my life.

750
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:51,550
Even a genius has a weakness, don't you know ?

751
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,150
It can't be...

752
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,430
What's this?
Irie, this isn't you, is it?

753
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,660
Irie looks like a girl.

754
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,850
Irie is dressed up as a girl.

755
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,960
How did you get it?

756
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,230
Your mother gave me another one.
I treasured it in my train pass holder.

757
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,830
The childhood picture of someone I like.

758
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,990
But it turned me off because

759
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:40,590
this looked... like a girl.

760
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,150
Now you know how it feels to be laughed at.

761
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,810
Come with me.

762
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,270
Bronze. Silver.

763
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,800
I'm gold!

764
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,390
Class F and Class A!

765
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,420
Are you all having a good time?

766
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,250
I, Kin-chansama,

767
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,880
will make you more excited!

768
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,650
I made

769
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,660
this song

770
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:50,820
for a girl I love.

771
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,390
The feelings that I had for three years.

772
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,850
I will show them for you.

773
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,250
Please listen this song called

774
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,130
"I love You, Kotoko"

775
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,870
I love you, I love you.

776
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,040
La la la, la la la ~

777
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,560
I love you

778
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:21,150
Kotoko, Kotoko, Kotoko...

779
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:25,710
Tokyo is a lonely city.

780
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,940
Really.

781
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:34,850
Everyone is looking the other way.
Really.

782
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,240
But Kotoko,

783
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,230
you smile is ~

784
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:48,790
What is it?

785
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:51,460
You made such a commotion, huh?

786
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,750
I'm not scared of you!

787
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,770
You also...

788
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,940
made fun of my feelings for you.

789
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,390
Do you know?

790
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,640
I'm just ~

791
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:19,620
glad that I met you.

792
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:28,730
I'm, I'm, I'm ~

793
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,500
Just happy.

794
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,430
Kotoko!

795
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,270
I give up.

796
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,940
I'm

797
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,150
going to quit loving you.

798
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:04,860
Ah...

799
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:09,420
So you will forget about me?

800
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:15,070
That's right. Now I know what kind of person you are.

801
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,500
I will forget about you and find someone nice at the university.

802
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,800
Then try and forget about me.

803
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,410
Serves you right.

804
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:43,610
Kotoko, won't I do?

805
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,540
Kotoko, when I need to do something, I'll do it.

806
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,070
Kiss?

807
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,430
My first kiss.

808
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,100
For the first time in my entire life...

809
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:17,470
the one that can only ever happen once... special kiss.

810
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,990
Me...

811
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,370
and Irie-kun...

812
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,210
kissed?

813
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,910
♫ My overgrown bangs are ♫

814
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,700
♫ gently shaken by the wind ♫

815
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:42,280
♫ It's still slightly chilly ♫

816
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:46,730
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

817
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:50,270
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

818
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:55,620
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

819
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,660
♫ I realized many things ♫

820
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:04,180
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

821
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,050
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

822
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:12,310
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

823
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:16,490
♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

824
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:22,780
♫ your smile, and today ♫

825
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,030
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

826
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:31,290
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

827
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,510
♫ Above all, there's the irreplaceable time, ♫

828
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,910
♫ your smile, and surely tomorrow as well ♫

829
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,880
♫ Your memories and your future ♫

830
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,130
♫ Hold onto them tightly, so they won't be ruined ♫

831
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:52,330
♫ More than anyone else, ♫

832
00:54:52,380 --> 00:55:00,640
♫  I always want to walk by your side ♫

833
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,300
Who is that beautiful girl?

834
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,580
Is this your girlfriend?

835
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,500
No way.

836
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,640
Why don't you join the same club as Irie.

837
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,560
That way even though you are in a different department,

838
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,340
you will be able to stay with Irie!

839
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,800
Aihara Kotoko!!!

840
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,480
If you don't do anything that beautiful girl
is going to get him.

841
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,610
She has a great body and she is beautiful.

842
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,560
You seem to still not understand about him.

843
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,910
Let's go back to living like we used to.

844
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:27,070
You can't forget about me, can you?

845
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:30,720
It doesn't seem as thought he feels the same.
