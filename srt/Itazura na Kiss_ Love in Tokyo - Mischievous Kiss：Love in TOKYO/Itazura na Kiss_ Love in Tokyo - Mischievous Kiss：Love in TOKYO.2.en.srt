1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,300
I'm Aihara Kotoko from class F.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,900
Can you read this?

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,860
I don't need it.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,100
I can't forgive him for dumping Kotoko.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,900
It's a challenge for me as well.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,100
It's fine.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,400
I'm giving up.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,100
When you move to a different place,
the vibe will change, too.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,370
Wait a moment, wait.

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,000
Don't you hear something strange?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,900
A shooting star.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,600
Hit by the shooting star...?

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,400
Here's Iri's house.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,700
With a strange relation,

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,600
I, Aihara Kotoko, started to live at the house of

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,100
my father's close friend.

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,800
But the house was...

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,000
What's wrong with you, Kotoko?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,300
Sorry to say hello late.

20
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,500
-I'm the eldest Naoki.
He's the guy I admire.

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
It's a house where Irie Naoki lives at.

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Don't tell anyone that we live together.

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,800
Don't you ever talk to me at school.

24
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,400
-You don't have to say that...
-I

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
hate stupid girls.

26
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm so angry.

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,200
I'll make sure that he'll come back to me!

28
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,600

I keep updating myself ♫

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,900

Mischievous Kiss: Love in TOKYO

61
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,300
#02
The entrance test of love
-The season I don't like came.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,900
This is the semester's final timetable.

63
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,500
-What?
-Be quiet, quiet.

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Quiet!

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Here!

66
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,300
What happened, Aihara?

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you have stomachache?

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,300
I have a question.

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,800
From the English subject you're teaching, is a range of possible questions decided already?

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,500
-What?
-Does it cover until lesson 3 or 4?

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,200
-So funny.
-Be quiet!

72
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,190
Yes, let's go home~ go home~

73
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,000
What's up with you, Kotoko? It's not usual.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,300
I...

75
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,500
Can't forgive Irie Naoki.

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,000
-Good for you.
-You're right.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
So I'm going to do it this time.

78
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,700
I'm going to win over Irie Naoki at the finals.

79
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,700
What is it? You guys...

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,800
Hey, you know he's the unbeatable one at the top every time.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,600
He's the top of the pre-SAT for all state students as well. He's not someone you can compete with.

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,300
-Of course.
-Yeah, right.

83
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,900
Well... Well... Then I'll put my name on the board at least.

84
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,700
I'll put my name on the same paper

85
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
where Irie Naoki's name is on.

86
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
Are you saying you want to get into the Top 100 rank?

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,500
That's not going work. We're the class F.

88
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,400
Right, right. Stop talking about the stupid stuff. Let's go to eat something delicious to make you feel better.

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
-Yes? Let's go.
-No.

90
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,300
History is there to change.

91
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,400
I'll definitely get in the Top 100 and

92
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,900
put my name on the board to change the history of class F.

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,400
Well then. I'll go first.

94
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,700
What happened to Kotoko?

95
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,800
Yay, it came.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,600
-It came. Thank you.
-It looks delicious.

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Thank you for the meal.

98
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,300
Still soft. Today's one is good, too.

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,600
Kin, you're really good.

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
I can trust you when it comes to food.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
Why only about the food?

102
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,800
Master, good reputation going here.

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,900
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

104
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,800
This week's service, Colombian (coffee) is the best.

105
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
It would've been better if Kotoko came with us.

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,900
Right?

107
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,800
She's going to make the Top 100.

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Really, what happened to her?

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,900
About that...

110
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,400
Don't you think she's strange somehow
since they moved to new house?

111
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,500
You guys still don't even know where she lives now.

112
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,900
Ah... But she said she can walk to school now.

113
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,600
That means...

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Setakaya?

115
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,310
Sibuya?

116
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,760
Or maybe Meguro?

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,200
That's suspicious.

118
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,720
There's no way she would live in such rich districts.

119
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,270
But she's staying at someone else's place.

120
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,450
Did she say it's her father's friend's place?

121
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,260
Yeah, right.

122
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,900
Would that be true?

123
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,590
Or doesn't she maybe ...

124
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,860
Get harassed at that house?

125
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,330
She's saying she has to go study, but

126
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,760
she's actually exploited to work at home...?

127
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,640
That can't be it in these days.

128
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,310
She's right, you pervert!

129
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,880
Right, he's really a pervert.

130
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,700
It's funny, so funny. Isn't he a pervert?

131
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,010
Totally funny.

132
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,600
Something doesn't feel right...

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,310
Thank you for the food.

134
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,920
Thank you for the food.

135
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,270
(Delicious.)

136
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,830
So now Ai's shop is re-opened with no problem then?

137
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,800
Things worked out good, Kotoko.

138
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,120
Yes, thank you for your help.

139
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,440
Thank you so much.

140
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,640
No, you're welcome.

141
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,600
Hum? This rice... Honey, where is this rice from?

142
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,680
It's not rice. It's some sort of pasta.

143
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,350
Right?

144
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,670
He's really good-looking anyway.

145
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,370
I... Hate stupid girls.

146
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,370
I ate well.

147
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,670
You don't have to be in such a hurry to finish.

148
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,710
The final tests are coming up soon.

149
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,480
I have to go study.

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,220
Then I'll excuse myself first.

151
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,570
Wow, she's trying hard.

152
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,970
Easy Math 2 Note

153
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
I don't even know which part I don't know.

154
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,500
Let's start with English.

155
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,400
English.

156
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,390
Here it is.

157
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,090
I should've listened more carefully in class.

158
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,290
Right on.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,780
I...

160
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,360
D...

161
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,310
With this pace,

162
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,870
It's going to take 100 years to get into the Top 100...

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,210
-Kotoko.
-Yes.

164
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,900
Can I talk to you?

165
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,320
Yes.

166
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,410
If it's okay with you, would you take a break?

167
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,770
Thank you.

168
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,440
That's okay.

169
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,810
Ah...

170
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,800
Ah...

171
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Have some.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,490
Thank you.

173
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,330
-Here.
-Thank you for the food.

174
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,860
It looks so good.

175
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,800
It's delicious!

176
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,690
It made me happy too.

177
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,000
I've always wanted to try this once.
It was a dream of mine.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,900
What about Irie-kun?

179
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,640
Well you know,

180
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,800
Naoki never studies.

181
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,250
Huh?

182
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,000
Irie-kun

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
doesn't study?

184
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,200
What is he doing now?

185
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
He goes to bed early.

186
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,000
Eh?

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,400
So Irie-kun is really a genius.

188
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,800
But is that a good thing?

189
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,700
Huh?

190
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,900
I don't know how to say, but

191
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,300
I feel like

192
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,400
he'll lose something by staying like that.

193
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,500
Irie-kun will be just fine!

194
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,200
I mean, he has such an amazing family.

195
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
Thank you.

196
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,900
That's right!

197
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,300
Kotoko-chan.

198
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Yes.

199
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,400
Do you want to see an album of Naoki as a kid?

200
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,300
I do.

201
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,500
Wait a second!

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,900
Album...

203
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,460
So Irie-kun is sleeping, right?

204
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

205
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's go with this one.

206
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,700
Amazing!

207
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,230
My photography skills are almost professional.

208
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,300
I like taking pictures.

209
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,600
But, I don't have many recent.

210
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,500
Since Naoki doesn't like taking photos,
Yuki even has begun to copy him.

211
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,100
I miss those days.

212
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,000
So Irie-kun was good looking back then, too.

213
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,800
I remember this one.

214
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm grateful for the warm words of encouragement

215
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,800
my senpai have given me.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Oh, he's tiny!

217
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,700
Who is this little girl?

218
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,600
This is... Naoki.

219
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
No way!

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,100
He was so cute, wasn't he?

221
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
I wanted a girl so badly that I told myself,

222
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,600
"this child will be born a girl."

223
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,390
So, I only bought girls' clothes.

224
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Then things just escalated from there.

225
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,800
Things were fun back then.

226
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,500
You are the first person I've talked to about this.

227
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,700
It's a secret from Yuki, too.

228
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,060
Naoki told me to never tell him.

229
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,100
For now, let's keep it a secret between us.

230
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,280
Sure.

231
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,200
Well...

232
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,800
I'll give you

233
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
this one as a bribe for keeping the secret.

234
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,890
Really?

235
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,700
Thank you very much.

236
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,800
Cute!

237
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,800
Naoki, good morning.

238
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,230
Good morning.

239
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,800
Good morning.

240
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
What is it Kotoko?

241
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
You're sick?

242
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
No, it's nothing.

243
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Maybe she went nuts after studying too much last night?

244
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,900
People don't live a meaningless life.

245
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,200
1861 American civil war,
1861 American civil war.

246
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,700
People liberate slave warriors.
People liberate slave warriors.

247
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,800
1863, 1863,

248
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,700
Empancipation Proclamation,
1863 Emancipation Proclamation.

249
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,200
People let the involuntary slaves, who let a meaningless life...

250
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,370
Kotoko, you really are serious about this.

251
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,330
People liberate slave warriors.

252
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,140
People liberate slave warriors.

253
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,100
And next is...uhm, overnight they dropped their work.

254
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,300
Hey Kotoko!

255
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,200
Where are you living now?

256
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,150
Overnight they dropped their work.

257
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,500
Overnight they dropped their work.

258
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,100
There really is something wrong with her.

259
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,870
Aihara-san.

260
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,420
Irie Naoki!

261
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
You jerk, how dare you talk to Kotoko!

262
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,300
Aihara-san, could you bring your bag and
come out for a second?

263
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,600
Yes.

264
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,800
Could you bring...

265
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,700
your bag?

266
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,400
Why?

267
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,180
Could it be that jerk Irie has

268
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,600
changed his mind and wants to date with her after all?

269
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
No way!

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,700
Wait!

271
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,900
What is it?

272
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
This.

273
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,640
It looks like my mom made a mistake.

274
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,900
Oh.

275
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,200
You're right.

276
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,750
If the rumor mills in my class saw this,

277
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,900
it would raise hell.

278
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,770
Wait! The two of them just exchanged something, right?

279
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,700
What it this?

280
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,500
Things can get really inconvenient.

281
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,400
Why do both of us have to be at the same school?

282
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Seriously.

283
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,300
You might even mistakenly wear my uniform to school.

284
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,000
Why would I wear your uniform?

285
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,900
Because you were used to wearing a skirt when you were small, right?

286
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,700
What are they talking about?
I can't hear anything.

287
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,000
Shh! They'll hear us.

288
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Tada!

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,300
Why do you have that?

290
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,100
Your mom presented it to me.

291
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,400
What is it?

292
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,700
Geez, mom!

293
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,900
Anyway, give it back.

294
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,400
I refuse.

295
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Give it back!

296
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,280
I refuse!

297
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,600
I mean, you always bully me.

298
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Once in a while, I have to get back at you.

299
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,200
Even geniuses have weaknesses, right?

300
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,830
So you intend to blackmail me?

301
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,520
I'll give it back

302
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,780
but there is a condition.

303
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,670
For the next week, until the final exams,

304
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,610
can you be my tutor?

305
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,100
Me?

306
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,500
Your tutor?

307
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,700
How about this?

308
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,400
If you get me into the top 100, I'll return the photo.

309
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,900
- I refuse.
- Why?

310
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,400
"The most important thing is the ability to tell apart the impossible and the possible" - Phillip Chesterfield.

311
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
F-Field... What do you...

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,600
Basically, challenging the impossible is a waste of time!

313
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,700
Getting an idiot like you in the top 100 is obvioulsy impossible!

314
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,900
Then I'll pass this around the school!

315
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,700
Ah, wait, wait!

316
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
Fine.

317
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,150
Starting tonight, I'll teach you for one week.

318
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,000
Really?

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,900
But, I won't be cutting you any slack.

320
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,000
The top 100 ranks are usually filled with class A and B students.

321
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,800
It's going to take divine intervention
to get a class F student like you in.

322
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes.

323
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,700
Then, tonight.

324
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,900
Kotoko.

325
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,000
Did he do something weird to you?

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,810
What did you two talk about?

327
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,230
Oh, it was nothing.

328
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,600
Then, I'm going to study hard.

329
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Eat up. Yuki, don't leave anything behind.

330
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,920
That's right, Kotoko-chan.

331
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,000
At the table eating is your job.

332
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Yes.

333
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,000
Have some of this white radish.
The flavor has really marinated well.

334
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,400
Yes, it really has.

335
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,600
Studiyng alone with Irie-kun,

336
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
will happen?

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
Kotoko-chan, I'll make you some late night snacks tonight too, okay?

338
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,370
Thank you very much.

339
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,800
Mom, make two sets tonight.

340
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,320
Bring them both to her room.

341
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Two, you mean...

342
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,100
you're going to study too?

343
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,900
That's right.

344
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,330
Why just Kotoko?

345
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,600
Help me with my studies, too.

346
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,900
You're doing just fine.

347
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,500
Let's start.

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,400
Thanks for dinner.

349
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,260
Come in.

350
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,990
So...?

351
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,340
Which one to start?

352
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,250
Which subject are you not good at?

353
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,110
Probably Math?

354
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,090
Then that one.

355
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,710
What's the range?

356
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,450
Isn't it the same for all?

357
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,740
I don't know that.

358
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,650
The range is...

359
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,630
Up to page 40.

360
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,470
Then what will be asked is

361
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,320
This and

362
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,850
this and

363
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,790
How do you know that?

364
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,360
These are the basic points.

365
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,570
Irie, how do you usually study?

366
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,430
Once I listen or read, I can remember.

367
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,270
Then I'll give you some questions, find the answers.

368
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,450
If you can solve this, you can get around 80 points.

369
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,150
What the hell are you listening during the class?

370
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,740
I'd like to see the inside of your head.

371
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,450
What's going on?

373
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,280
For Naoki to study with someone else,

374
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,970
what could have made him change his mind like this?

375
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,070
Seems Kotoko is even more amazing than I expected.

376
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,710
In this short time,

377
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,750
she's already managed tochange him so much.

378
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,590
Perhaps it's a good change for Naoki.

379
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,300
Right? You think so, too?

380
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,920
Let's just watch them for now.

381
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,250
Do you have some tape?

382
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,720
Here.

383
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,610
You must follow this schedule.

384
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,560
Even when you go to the toilet or take a bath,
don't ever put the flashcards down.

385
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,140
Spartan!

386
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,620
Monster!

387
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,980
You don't have time for such silly complaits.

388
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,280
Then we'll go over the math formulas today.

389
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,400
It's past midnight already...

390
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,120
M is 3.

391
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,670
And parenthesis X

392
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,020
minus plus...

393
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,810
Is -5.

394
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,000
So far (in Japanese).

395
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,280
So far.

396
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,580
In other words (in Japanese).

397
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,270
In other words.

398
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,310
On purpose (with American accent).

399
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,420
What?

400
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,540
On purpose (with Japanese accent).

401
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,960
On purpose?

402
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,980
That's...

403
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,990
On purpose (in Japanese) ...?

404
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,870
On purpose (in Japanese).

405
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,710
All done!

406
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,530
Ph... Ph... Ph...

407
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,000
Philip Chesterfield.

408
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,620
The day before the finals

409
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,660
I made a list of expected questions for the exam so try to solve them.

410
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,270
Oh...

411
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,490
It's awesome. The answer really comes to my head.

412
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,260
Do it fast.

413
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,320
You have other subjects.

414
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,870
Yes.

415
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,550
When you apply it here,

416
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,900
it becomes 4.

417
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,930
So make this 4...

418
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,630
16.

419
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,370
Right? Then this square 16 is...

420
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,510
Equal to one half square.

421
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,860
Good, it's all done!

422
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,760
Are you sleeping?

423
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,460
Irie's

424
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,220
sleeping face.

425
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,630
I brought the night snack.

426
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,400
Good morning.

427
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,710
I made coffee. Would you like some?

428
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,190
Here.

429
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,820
I'm off to school.

430
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,430
Kotoko, wait.

431
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,430
Here.

432
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,080
-What is it?
-You can't open it yet.

433
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,350
After the test result, open it when you get in the Top 100.

434
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,050
It's a lucky charm until then.
To. Kotoko. A lucky charm.

435
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,650
Thank you.

436
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,450
It's only the end of term tests. You're overreacting.

437
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,120
Thank you so much. I'm going to school.

438
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,560
Have a good day.

439
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,120
Considering their mutual relationship, uhm...

440
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,580
Cosine is okay, sine is okay.

441
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,870
Double angle is okay. Good. It's prefect.

442
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,390
I'm told not to talk to him at school.

443
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,820
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

444
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,680
Then start the test.

445
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,400
I don't know.

446
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,640
This one is the same as Irie's question!

447
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,470
This one, this one, this one, too!

448
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,600
After 3 days

449
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,100
It's all done!

450
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,200
Then let's go play!

451
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,740
I want to go. Me, too!

452
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,660
Kotoko, I won't let you go.

453
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,560
-Let me go, let me go.
-I won't let you go.

454
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,610
You haven't hung with me lately, so I won't let you go today!

455
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:23,370
-Well... I can't help then.
-Where are we going? Where to?

456
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:27,330
Let me take care of that. Let's go!

457
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,200
Huh? Isn't she the girl who confessed to you?

458
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,910
She's already going along with another guy.

459
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,030
-I don't care.
-Sure.

460
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,460
Right! Class A is doing an after party at the coffee shop.
Do you want to come?

461
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,200
Well you wouldn't go.

462
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,600
No, I'm coming today for a change.

463
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,830
What? Really?

464
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,370
It's the first time you're like this in the last 3 years.

465
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,150
-I thought it'd be nice (to do this) sometimes.
-Let's go, go.

466
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,570
Results of 3rd Grade Finals

467
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,770
You're in second place again.

468
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,540
Excuse me.

469
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,690
1 Irie Naoki

470
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,710
That's good.

471
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,250
Congratulation for being the top. You got full credits.

472
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,700
Good for you. You made it.

473
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,440
Didn't you see?

474
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,730
It's a lie!

475
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,210
100 Aihara Kotoko 
100th place? 100th place? It's a lie!

476
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,510
Irie, 100th place. I made it! So happy!

477
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,360
We made it!

478
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,050
Not that. Give me back the thing you took before.

479
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,730
Oh...

480
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,790
Is this it?

481
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,040
Don't just take it out like that!

482
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,520
And how many times do I have to tell you?
Don't talk to me at school.

483
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,780
Hey, Irie.

484
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,350
"What's important is to have power to distinguish
between impossible and possible."

485
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,940
"If it is merely difficult, all you need is
the mental strength to follow throw..."

486
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,710
It's "through".

487
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,390
-What?
-After that, "All you need is
the mental strength to follow through,

488
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,220
and an inability to give up, and things will work."

489
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,500
You knew it already.

490
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,750
Something Chesterfield's continuation.

491
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,540
Of course.

492
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,690
Irie, thank you!

493
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,650
I put my name

494
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,920
on the same paper

495
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,200
where Irie's name is on.

496
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,390
She's the one. Aihara from class F. The girl in the middle.

497
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,480
-She cut in the Top 100.
-That's great.

498
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,130
She's the first smart kid from class F.

499
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,310
Finally you're the center of possitive gossip for a change.

500
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,540
Just being with you makes us proud, too.

501
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,550
You're laughing too much.

502
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,650
-Suspicious.
-It's totally suspicious.

503
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,590
I knew it from the beginning.

504
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:19,840
There has to be a secret at her new house.

505
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,100
-Good bye.
-Bye.

506
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,430
-See you tomorrow.
-Take care.

507
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,290
Aren't we too obvious?

508
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,910
Stupid, whatever it is, the look is the most important.

509
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,410
-You're right.
-Let's go.

510
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,070
The sunset

511
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,770
feels so good. Yay!

512
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,320
So it's here.

513
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,460
There is no way Kotoko can live in such a big house!

514
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,570
She is being used as a maid by some rich jerks after all.

515
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,760
You're right.

516
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,790
She's so pitiful.

517
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,420
She is.

518
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,850
Aniki (brother, address for a gang leader), look at that.

519
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,560
Irie!

520
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,090
What do you mean, Irie?

521
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:44,960
No.

522
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,370
Irie is written right there.

523
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,040
- Irie?
- Yes.

524
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,000
What is this?

525
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,370
Family. It means "Irie's Family".

526
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,410
Irie's Family?

527
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,520
Irie?

528
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,640
No.

529
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,190
But there are tons of people with the name Irie in Japan.

530
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,730
That's right.

531
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,310
True.

532
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,240
Yes that's right.

533
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,490
Aniki, look!

534
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,160
Irie...

535
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,060
Oh, hide. Hide!

536
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,520
Where?

537
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,720
No...

538
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,900
It can't be.

539
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,720
It couldn't be...

540
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,980
Tonan High School

541
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,600
Good morning.

542
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,590
Good morning.

543
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,630
Kotoko!

544
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,200
Kotoko!

545
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,180
Kotoko!

546
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,030
Kotoko!

547
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:19,360
Kotoko! You're living at

548
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,280
Irie Naoki's house right now?

549
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,110
Eh?

550
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,500
Yeah, like that would ever happen?

551
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,650
But I saw you walking into Irie's house with my own eyes!

552
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,200
Gintaro and Dozo are both witnesses!

553
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,340
Yeah, we saw it.

554
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,270
Don't you think it was a dream?

555
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,900
I mean I... at Irie's-kun...

556
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,940
we're both...

557
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,010
But, you saw her, didn't you?

558
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,130
I did.

559
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,450
Dream?

560
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,420
Dream!

561
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,830
No way that was a dream , we saw it.

562
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,950
A good luck charm for Kotoko-chan?

563
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,780
Stop being silly.

564
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:03,620
Wait a second!

565
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,000
What is with this photo?

566
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,950
A two shot with Irie?

567
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,490
Hey!

568
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,410
Wait, Kotoko, what is going on?

569
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,610
I'm really sorry.

570
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,860
So you are really... living at Irie's house?

571
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,030
But, but, but... it isn't what you think, Kin-chan.

572
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,060
Our fathers are best friends.

573
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,740
You know my house collapsed, right?

574
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:43,240
So until we find our next home, they are helping us out. That's how it is.

575
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,410
So,

576
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,240
could it be that...

577
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,730
Irie tutored you for the final exam we just took?

578
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,060
So that's why.

579
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,050
I really couldn't understand your scores.

580
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,010
So that was it?

581
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,240
Irie-kun really is a genius
if he could get Kotoko into th top 100.

582
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,310
That's a relief.

583
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,360
I knew it couldn't have been Kotoko's own skill.

584
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,070
Hey, you guys! That a bit much, isn't it?

585
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,360
But don't they look kind of good together?

586
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,300
I mean, she and Irie Naoki are living under the same roof!

587
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,470
Don't say that!

588
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,600
That is not true.

589
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,700
I mean, Irie-kun completely ignores me.

590
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,320
He hates me.

591
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,450
Kotoko, you're so pitiful!

592
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,340
Jinko!

593
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:47,970
But, even I'm over that cold-blooded person.

594
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,860
I'm fine.

595
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:55,690
But I've been told to keep our situation a secret at school,

596
00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:01,560
so everyone, please keep it a secret.

597
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,820
Ok.

598
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,330
Leave it to us.

599
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,170
Right guys?

600
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,450
Yeah! We won't tell anybody.

601
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,870
Thank you!

602
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,290
You're all so kind!

603
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,420
But, don't they look kind of goog together?

604
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,620
Aihara!

605
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,250
- What is it ?
- Shut up and follow me.

606
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,320
I thought we couldn't talk to each other at school?

607
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,410
~ Extra! Irie Naoki and Aihara Kotoko, the rumored couple are living together! ~

608
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,250
The big scoop on Irie Naoki et Aihara Kotoko!

609
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,650
Big scoop!

610
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,020
Well,

611
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,820
Jinko et Satomi...

612
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,220
What are you friends thinking!

613
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,580
Please take one!

614
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,570
Hey, you are sure this was ok?

615
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,400
Like I said, leave it on me.

616
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,050
Love needs to be planted before it skins in!

617
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,880
That's our Jinko.

618
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,170
Please take one!

619
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:21,490
Here is the scoop on Irie Naoki et Aihara Kotoko!

620
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,590
Irie-kun.

621
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,510
I'm sorry.

622
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,260
I'm really sorry.

623
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,820
You wrote me a love letter,
so you might be ok with the rumors,

624
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,400
but this is a real nuisance for me.

625
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,680
From now on don't throw me off my pace again.

626
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,550
Why

627
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,350
am I crying?

628
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,730
Homemade cooking ?

629
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:01,080
If this is the best you can do,
will anyone be willing to marry you?

630
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,500
Wouldn't it be great if Kotoko was Naoki's bride?

631
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,160
What is it?

632
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,360
Marriage is out of the question!

633
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,410
Just come out and say it.

634
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,640
What are you doing?

635
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,440
He's too cruel!

636
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,380
You can't lose!

637
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,430
You've got to stay at Kotoko's side
so that you don't lose to Irie!

638
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,560
You never know when it come to a person's feeling.

639
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,020
I might hate you today, but I may come to like you tomorrow.

640
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,970
Stop, what are you doing?
