1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,600
Are you alright, Yuki-kun?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,100
It's better for him to get a surgery as soon as possible.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,000
Your brother fainted.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Aren't you being too selfish?

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,900
The thoughts you have.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,700
It's important to say those to people around you.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,500
Thank you, Kotoko.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Graduating from college and continuing dad's business...

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Then it's like I'm living as my parents told me to.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Nao . . .

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,100
Of course it's something happened without me knowing.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,900
I still think

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,700
Naoki and I have nothing in progress.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,800
And the time passes...

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,900
When Yuki successfully had his surgery and

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,560
is discharged from the hospital,
it was already the end of the year.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
For those people who have lovers,

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,900
the best Christmas season that they had longed for, arrived.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,500
However, for those people who don't have anyone ...

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,800
You're welcome.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,700
Hey, hey, guy over there!

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,000
Please, refill my glass of water.

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,810
How many hours are you going to
stay only for coffee and water?

24
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,980
Hey, hey, hey...

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,300
What are you going to do for Christmas Eve day?

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Perhaps coming back to home...?

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,000
Work.

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,500
What?

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,900
Hey.

30
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,100
He's working at a cafe, there's no way he can
take a break on Christmas Eve.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,900
By any chance,

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,800
are you working with him?

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,200
Right.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,900
I'll work hard with Irie-kun.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,000
Christmas Eve,, the reservations are full.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Then I'll make a reservation, too.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
Would you?

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,800
At our cafe on Christmas eve,
you can only have a set coursed dinner.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
What?

40
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,770
On top of which, it's dinner for two.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,000
Dinner for two?!

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,400
It costs $200!

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,350
It's off my limit.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm fine.

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,100
Even if I can't spent time with Irie-kun,

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,900
I have friends.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,100
Kotoko!

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,800
-Kotoko!
-Jinko, Satomi!

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,200
Hey, about this year's Christmas...

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,700
Hey, I have someone to introduce to you.

51
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,600
Someone you want to introduce?

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,300
Hah! He came, came!

53
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,700
What's up? What?

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,000
Come this way.

55
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,650
Hey, come!

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,300
I'll introduce him.

57
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,300
My boyfriend, Narasaki-kun. He's in a band.

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm Narasaki. Nice to meet you.

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
Here's my boyfriend, Takamiya Ryo-kun.

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,500
He's a law student.

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,600
It's the first time to meet you, I'm Nakamiya Ryo.

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,900
Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,300
Boyfriend...?

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,800
Both of you, when...?

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,100
I really wanted to introduce him to you before Christmas.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Is that so? That's how it is.

67
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
Congratulations to both of you.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

69
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,100
For that reason,

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm the only one who doesn't have a boyfriend

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,700
before the first Christmas at college.

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,800
This situation.

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,900
I feel like it's going to be the worst Christmas ever.

Mischievous Kiss: Love in TOKYO

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,500
#11
Santa Claus is a Lover

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Ko~toko-chan.

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,100
Kin-chan.

107
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
What about work? Can you hang out?

108
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,600
My shift is about to end.

109
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,900
More than that, did you hear?
Jinko and Satomi have boyfriends!

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,900
Then it means that both of them will have the

111
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,500
HOT Christmas Eve.

112
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,650
Because it's the first Christmas Eve with a lover.

113
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,850
That's how it's supposed to be.

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
That means...

115
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
most importantly!

116
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,650
Kotoko is

117
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,560
left alone.

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't say that.

119
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
You must be lonely.

120
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,060
You must be sad.

121
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,400
That's why I prepared this special plan for Kotoko...

122
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
You're here!

123
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,850
Jinko?

124
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,100
Listen to me, Kotoko.

125
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,600
You can't spend the Christmas Eve with Narasaki-kun?

126
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,700
But it's first Christmas Eve for you and him.

127
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,600
Right? But Narasaki-kun said

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,800
he had to attend the Christmas Concert.

129
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,900
Because Christmas is a day for love,

130
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,500
he said he had to spread love to the world.

131
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,100
What a musician.

132
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,300
Can't you spend time with him after the concert?

133
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,100
The concert is not held in Tokyo.

134
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,900
It's in Sendai.

135
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,400
It ends at really late night.

136
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I won't be able to come back home that night.

137
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,500
But he's try to be a professional musician, right?
Then there's nothing to stop him...

138
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I know all that.

139
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,000
But I want him to spread the love to me,

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,500
not only to the world.

141
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
Do you understand?

142
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,700
I'll eat up.

143
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,560
You guys are here.

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,800
Listen to me. Ryo is... Ryo is...

145
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,500
Ryo told me he can't spend Christmas with me.

146
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,300
You, too?

147
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,000
You're lying...

148
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,300
Ryo said

149
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,000
he can't bail out from work.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,100
He's said that he's working to give me a present.

151
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,500
But it's not about the materials!

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,100
It's about the feelings, that's what we want, right?

153
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,200
Men really don't know what women want.

154
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,600
Why can't they understand our girl minds that

155
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,400
we really want to spend time together on that specific day?

156
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,600
You're so right.

157
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,800
Fine!

158
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,200
Let's leave the men who don't get the female minds behind.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,300
For this year's Christmas,

160
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,700
let's have a fun party just for the three of us!

161
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,100
Good!

162
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,200
But are you okay with that, Kotoko?

163
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Right, Irie will come back home for Christmas.

164
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,100
About that,

165
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,900
Irie-kun's going to work at the cafe

166
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,300
with Matsumoto Yuko.

167
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,800
That's the worst.

168
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,500
I won't lose to you both that

169
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,000
he's no better in understanding the female mind.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,400
Well, then again, I'm not exactly his girlfriend...

171
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,700
That doesn't matter.

172
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,400
Anyway we can't trust guys at all!

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
You're right. What we can believe is

174
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
girl friends only!

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,300
The three of us,

176
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,500
bring your hands.

177
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,300
Let's make a pact.

178
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,400
We'll have a fun Christmas Eve just for the three of us!

179
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
-Agreed!
-Agreed!

180
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Betrayal is

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,900
zero tolerance!

182
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,700
-Yes!
-Yes!

183
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,300
Wait, wait, wait!

184
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
I'm here, too.

185
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
That's scary, really scary!

186
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
Hey, girls.

187
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Those guys and I are a lot different.

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
If you guys are going to have a party, count me on, too!

189
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,900
I'll use all my skills to make you the Christmas food.

190
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,700
I won't betray you all.

191
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,300
Let's make the night

192
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,400
fun for us all! Let's . . . let's . . . let's . . .

193
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,650
What?

194
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,500
What? Why?

195
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,560
Hey, Kin. You're still an intern,
you work at the restaurant.

196
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
She's right. What about Aihara?

197
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,770
They're right. Do you think there's a restaurant where's

198
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,440
on break for Christmas Eve in this world?

199
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,710
What?

200
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,380
I should get off early at Christmas Eve.

201
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,660
[Aihara]
Yes, we'll wait for you. Thank you.

202
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,240
Bye.

203
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,930
Christmas with Kotoko~ Christmas with Kotoko~

204
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,210
Things are going really well.

205
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,540
That's right, Aniki!

206
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,110
9, 10...

207
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,750
You're kidding! All the tables...

208
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,870
Even the counter seats!

209
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,390
They're perfectly full with reservations!

210
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,880
Of course it's Christmas Eve!

211
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,490
The first period from 6pm and the second period from 8pm.

212
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,880
Dang, there will also be customers without reservations.

213
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,430
It's going to be a big deal.

214
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,910
But Isn't Christmas an event of the Christians?

215
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,260
Why would they eat Japanese food on that day?

216
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,420
It's thankful thing for the restaurant.

217
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,670
Most especially, Master will take off around 9 o'clock.

218
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,980
After that, the two of us have to make it through.

219
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,310
What are you talking about?

220
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,870
He has something important to do.

221
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,040
Probably a party.

222
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,230
Par-ty?

223
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,090
It's Christmas party!

224
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,570
Christmas part-ty?

225
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,740
Oh my god!

226
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,510
That's right.

227
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,530
Because of his hard work, his company meets
its 20th year of anniversary.

228
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,990
Right?

229
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,670
So we're going to have a celebrating party

230
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,790
at the Prince Hotel.

231
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,890
Is that so? Congratulation to you!

232
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,650
You're welcome, welcome.

233
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,170
I've made this far

234
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,800
because of every one's support.

235
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,720
It's a simple way to express our gratitude.

236
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,630
So

237
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,430
Kotoko's father will come

238
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,500
after work.

239
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,680
My father?

240
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
Yeah, many of the party invitees

241
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,100
are regulars of Aihara.

242
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,390
And I have many guests I want to introduce this time.

243
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,510
So I was hoping

244
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,390
you would come if you can?

245
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,800
That's awesome!

246
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,330
Christmas at the Hotel Prince.

247
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,680
Right?

248
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,620
Yes.

249
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,070
Let's make a pact.

250
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,170
We'll have a fun Christmas just for the three of us!

251
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,070
Agreed!

252
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,720
You can't betray!

253
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,490
YES!

254
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,540
I'm sorry, I already have a plan for the day.

255
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,510
A plan?

256
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,460
Wi... With a guy?

257
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,430
Kotoko-chan!

258
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,040
Do you have someone else than Naoki?

259
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,320
No way.

260
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,380
It's different. I promised with Jinko and Satomi.

261
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,280
Since you invited me, I really want to go but...

262
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,900
Well... Can't do something about the plan?

263
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,190
This time guys are not allowed

264
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,270
because of many reasons.

265
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,040
Well then...

266
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,560
I'm sorry but there's nothing we can do.

267
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,860
Mom, how about Naoki?

268
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,970
Naoki's coming to the party, right?

269
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,790
He can't come, either.

270
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,540
What? Is that right?

271
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,600
He said he had to work at the cafe for Christmas Eve.

272
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,080
It's no fun then.

273
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,570
Right?

274
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,280
Even though it's Dad's company party...

275
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,850
It's unusual, isn't it,

276
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,150
for you to call me to a place like this.

277
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,180
Ginger ale.

278
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,470
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,650
What is it that you want to say?

280
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,940
Okay.

281
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,860
You heard about our company's
celebrating foundation party from Mom, right?

282
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,600
Yes.

283
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,040
I want you to come.

284
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,290
I'm asking.

285
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,140
I know your scheme.

286
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,880
You want to introduce me to

287
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,460
the people at the party as a successor.

288
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,600
But I haven't decided whether
I'm going to continue your company.

289
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,570
I know that.

290
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,840
But can't you come for this time?

291
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,000
Leave that matter aside,

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,870
It's enough for me if you show your face.

293
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,940
I'm asking. Please come.

294

[Diagnosis, Rescue: The latest medical magazine]

295
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,870
I feel like Irie-kun will make it somehow.

296
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,800
Like you'll create many new medicines or

297
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,760
become a doctor and cure a disease.

298
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,620
-Dad's home early.
-Yes, he's early.

299
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,910
Why are you here, Irie-kun?

300
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,420
What?

301
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,360
Is it bad to come to my own house?

302
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,680
No, it's just has been so long.

303
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,160
But what changed your mind?

304
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
I came to get my suit.

305
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,420
A suit?

306
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,830
I can't wear jeans to a party.

307
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,680
Naoki, are you going to attend the Christmas Eve party?

308
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,980
I asked to give me a break during work.

309
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,080
So I'll be late.

310
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,740
I'll show my face for just a moment.

311
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,830
Awesome, Naoki's coming!

312
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,680
Thank you, Dad will be so happy.

313
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,700
Right... Irie-kun's going to the party.

314
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,610
Then if I go to that party,

315
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,230
I'll be able to spend Christmas Eve with Irie-kun.

316
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:41,390
I'm confused, but isn't this situation forgivable even if I leave the friendship behind?

317
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,130
I was also thinking of going to the...

318
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,340
I heard you can't make it.

319
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,980
What?

320
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,420
You're spending Christmas with your girlfriends.

321
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,320
About that... Um...

322
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,110
It's a shame.

323
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,710
It would be so much fun if you were there.

324
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,720
Irie-kun, um, I - - -

325
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,290
He's right.

326
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,200
Naoki, please persuade Kotoko-chan to come.

327
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,930
No, it can't be helped.

328
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,440
She made a decision.

329
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,010
But...

330
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,300
I think the girl friends will betray easily.

331
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,160
No matter what it's Christmas Eve.

332
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,260
No, no... Their friendship is something special.

333
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,230
Right, Kotoko?

334
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,680
That's... Well...

335
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,900
Is that so?

336
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,090
Naoki.

337
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,770
Naoki, that suit. The one you wore
at the high school graduation ceremony.

338
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,810
Irie-kun's mean.

339
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,530
Well then. I can't do anything about it.

340
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,130
I made a pact to not betray...

341
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,390
Christmas.

342
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,190
Oh, my!

343
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,020
So we're picking the cake from this limited area in Sibuya?

344
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,800
I'll put in an advanced order.

345
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,420
It looks so delicious, so excited!

346
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,150
A party with Irie...

347
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,680
Kotoko?

348
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,190
Kotoko, can you hear me?

349
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,980
What?

350
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,350
Wow, that looks so delicious!

351
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,940
Then I'll prepare chicken.

352
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,600
And game.

353
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,120
And since it's Christmas, we should prepare presents!

354
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,050
Right.

355
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,140
These two are expecting so much for the day.

356
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,020
It's fine this way.

357
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,030
White Christmas~ Yay!

358
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,330
Yes, perfect!

359
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,510
Great.

360
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,400
Hey, is everyone ready?

361
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,320
Yes!

362
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,430
Huh? Where's Naoki?

363
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,610
He will be going after he is done with work.

364
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,120
Okay.

365
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,790
Aihara-san will be late,

366
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,350
since he is going after work, too.

367
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,270
Okay. So we are all ready.

368
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,610
Let's go out!
-Yeah!

369
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,890
Kotoko-chan,

370
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,480
will you really be okay?

371
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,870
Naoki finally decided to go.

372
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,260
Yes, it's too bad, but I promised my friends first.

373
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,550
Moreover,

374
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,510
thank you very much for letting us use the house.

375
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,680
Jinko and Satomi, are really happy!

376
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,930
Feel free to use it.

377
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,740
Yes!

378
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,910
We're going to be late tonight.

379
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,120
If you guys are using here for a party, I'd rather thank you.

380
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,940
Lately,

381
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,240
Because probably it's the end of the year,

382
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,560
the thieves show up around

383
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,800
this area, too.

384
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,400
So if you guys are making loud noises,

385
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,490
it's rather safe that way.

386
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,180
Yes, thank you very much.

387
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,230
No worries.

388
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,950
Well, it's too bad we couldn't go all together, but

389
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,160
Kotoko-chan

390
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,270
you have fun too!

391
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,090
I will!

392
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,700
Let's hurry and go.

393
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,440
-Okay.
Let's go, let's go.

394
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,850
-We're leaving!
-Bye!

395
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,040
Irie-kun in a suit...

396
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,490
he will look so cool.

397
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,570
Par-ty, right?

398
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,130
May I have this dance?

399
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,890
Certainly.

400
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,140
No, no! It's a girls' night.

401
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,960
It's girls' night!

402
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,750
Girls' night with Jinko and Satomi!

403
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,950
Ah, there it is. Pin!

404
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,170
So cute!

405
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,860
Christmas is so nice!

406
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,140
Huh? It's long.

407
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,460
Why can't I untie this? I didn't know it's going to be like this.

408
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,800
No, no.

409
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,490
This year...

410
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,620
What kind of presents will there be, I wonder?

411
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,220
Alright!

412
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,870
I thought this Christmas Eve would be spent working with Naoki. Why is it turning out this way?

413
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,110
Merry Christmas!

414
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,950
It's a coincidence.

415
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,000
I had no idea Matsumoto would

416
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,940
work at this place on Christmas.

417
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,210
Ah, we-we..well...

418
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,270
How... How about going for a dinner after work?

419
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,890
Aren't you eating dinner now?

420
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,180
And even for two people portion.

421
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,570
Excuse me, waitress, water please.

422
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,400
Waitress, Waitress Matsumoto, water please.

423
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,000
Right now, I wish I was

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,410
waiting for Irie-kun.

425
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,450
They'll be here soon.

426
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,190
Hello? Jinko. What is it?

427
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,530
I'm sorry, Kotoko!

428
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,270
Narasaki's concert in Sendai

429
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,360
is cancelled due to heavy snow.

430
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,230
Since it happened, he came to Tokyo

431
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,780
to see me by hitchhiking.

432
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,930
The train is not moving but he came by hitchhiking!

433
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,920
I can't go to a party and leave Narasaki like this.

434
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,580
Please, only for this time

435
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,960
let me be with him.

436
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,900
Oh, okay, I got it.

437
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,330
I'll tell Satomi, too.

438
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,380
It's okay, it's okay.

439
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,450
I know it can't be helped.

440
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,800
Say hi to Narasaki-kun for me.

441
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:30,300
Well... Satomi and I, just the two of us will have a good time.

442
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,180
Hello. What's up, Satomi?

443
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,710
Sorry, Kotoko!

444
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,940
Ryoutaro actually lied about working today.

445
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,580
He's at my house right now, with this beautiful bouquet of flowers...

446
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,290
It looks like I can't make it.

447
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,060
Actually he tried to surprise me,

448
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,740
he even made a reservation at a restaurant a long time ago.

449
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,480
He said he wanted it to be a surprise!

450
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,170
So I'm really sorry...

451
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,650
Okay.

452
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,370
I'll just have fun with Jinko.

453
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:14,970
I'm really sorry.
Next time I'll treat the both of you.

454
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,350
Don't worry. Well, have fun.
-Yeah.

455
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,040
Thanks.

456
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,020
I ended up being abandoned anyway...

457
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:38,380
I should've just gone to the party...

458
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,390
That's right, I can go to the party now!

459
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,110
Jinko and Satomi are with their boyfriends, so...

460
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,190
I came here.

461
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,350
Well, I did say...

462
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,020
you can't trust girlfriends.

463
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,980
You're even betrayed by your friends, stupid Kotoko.

464
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,620
When you're like that, you'll be hated by Naoki.

465
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,350
It's too uncool.

466
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,030
Thank you.

467
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,960
Thank you, please come again.

468
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,020
Well, then. I'm off.

469
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,360
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

470
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,540
Only one reservation group left. We'll make it through.

471
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,970
Yes.

472
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,860
It's the first time I've seen the restaurant this busy.

473
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,700
Christmas is not something to ignore.

474
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,750
That's right.

475
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,500
Welcome!

476
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,980
Welcome.

477
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,150
Thank you.

478
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,700
This restaurant has quite a good review by critics.

479
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,870
They continue the traditions and highly evaluated
at NEO JAPANET for their unique Japanese food.

480
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,960
Really, is that so?

481
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,510
Ryo, you picked Japanese restaurant.
You're so deep and cool.

482
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,560
You're welcome.

483
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,240
Satomi, why are you here?

484
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,300
Kin-chan why are you here?

485
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,260
Oh, wait... Is this possibly the restaurant that Kotoko's dad runs?

486
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,390
You know this place?

487
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,500
Satomi, you're really something.

488
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,150
You're a step ahead.

489
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,720
Satomi, aren't you supposed to have a party with Kotoko?

490
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,190
What about Kotoko?

491
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,520
I'm sorry, Kin-chan.

492
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,420
My boyfriend suddenly came to pick me up...

493
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,190
I'm Takamiya Ryo...

494
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,740
Is Kotoko alone now?

495
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,880
No, she is with Jinko.

496
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,700
I guess those two would have a lot fun now.

497
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,560
Okay, then.

498
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,070
Wow, it looks so delicious.

499
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,720
It's tempura wrapped with vegetable.

500
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,320
Please enjoy.

501
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,630
Eating Japanese food for Christmas is not bad.

502
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,620
Right?

503
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,250
It's good.

504
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,060
Oh, Jin...

505
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,810
What was that before?

506
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,440
I'm helping Narasaki's performance now.

507
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,190
What?

508
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,760
Aren't you partying with Kotoko now?

509
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,340
That's... Narasaki suddenly went back from Sendai.

510
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,330
Kotoko's partying with Satomi.

511
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,130
Is that so?

512
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,960
Then it's fine. Have fun.

513
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,220
Merry Christmas.

514
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,650
Love, love, love.

515
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:05,540
Love, love, love (In Japanese).

516
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:11,450
This is love, love, love.

517
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,740
Love, love, love.

518
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,330
But I think

519
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,690
girl friends would easily betray you.

520
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,510
No matter what it's Christmas Eve.

521
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:43,310
Christmas with Irie-kun . . .

522
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,460
Hungry...

523
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:24,220
Jinko and Satomi were supposed to bring chicken and cake.

524
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,820
Only dried snacks are available.

525
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,260
Salt ramen it is...

526
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,190
It's Christmas Eve,

527
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,470
How are you guys doing?

528
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,390
When it's Christmas Eve,

529
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,130
Delicious.

530
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,440
we're supposed to have a fun dinner as a couple.

531
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,410
There's no way

532
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,400
a person can be alone in the room...

533
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,750
Well, those kinds of people must exist, huh?

534
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,620
If that's the case, you can just say, "So what?," but...

535
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,040
Christmas is fun!

536
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,970
Can you look at here?

537
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,930
Say Christmas, Christmas. It's so loud, I can see it all.

538
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,800
I feel emptiness.

539
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,760
What is it?

540
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,340
A thief has been breaking into houses around here.

541
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,430
No way...

542
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:13,430
No, it's possible because Irie family is rich.

543
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,400
What should I do?

544
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,980
Right!

545
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,650
A thief! Get out! Get out!

546
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,810
Get out!

547
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,380
What are you doing?

548
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,310
Irie-kun!!

549
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,110
I'm sorry, are you alright?

550
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,840
He's so good-looking.

551
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,210
What is it?

552
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,240
No.

553
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,200
You look like this but I hit your head...

554
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,530
And it's your own house...

555
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,520
You did all that!

556
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,330
I'm sorry.

557
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,610
Seriously.

558
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,190
I'm sorry, Irie.

559
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,720
Because I heard the clinking sound outside

560
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,180
I though it's a thief.

561
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,460
I got confused and tried to
open it with a key for my apartment.

562
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,450
Seriously, hit me with your stupidly strong power...

563
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,160
My bad.

564
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,590
But anyway, why aren't you at your father's party?

565
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,700
You didn't go?

566
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,490
I went.

567
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,230
I ran away in the middle of the party.

568
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,210
I was bored to be introduced to the higher power clients.

569
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,540
Dad must be really mad by now.

570
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,590
What about you?

571
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,030
Your friends' little... 'party.' Didn't work out?

572
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,310
That's... Jinko and Satomi

573
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,280
suddenly got things to do with their boyfriends.

574
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,380
Wow. That's a close friendship if I've ever seen one.

575
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,250
Please don't put it that way...

576
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,620
What's that smell?

577
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,560
What, this?

578
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,810
Chicken! Did you, by any chance, get it for me?

579
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,640
As if.

580
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,620
I'm hungry.

581
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,720
I didn't end up eating anything at the party.

582
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,790
Well, you see, I didn't have anything except some instant ramen, soooo...

583
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,750
It was hard.

584
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,560
I'm really bushed.

585
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,220
-Should we get off now?
-Yes.

586
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,490
Right.

587
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,460
Excuse me, Bro.

588
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,170
What?

589
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,910
I want to do something.

590
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,990
Can I stay here?

591
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,720
That's fine.

592
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,140
Thank you.

593
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,060
I'm eating dinner with Irie-kun alone

594
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,550
on Christmas Eve.

595
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,330
Right!

596
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,180
I prepared it for Jinko and Satomi.

597
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,610
Somehow, this really does feel like Christmas...

598
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,420
Is that so?

599
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:17,400
It's probably my first time doing this after having grown up.

600
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:28,440
You know, my mom passed away early.

601
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,950
Dad has to work at the restaurant.

602
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:37,820
He was always busy at Christmas until the night.

603
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,450
I had a party with friends, but

604
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,630
I've never had the real Christmas-like Christmas with family.

605
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,430
I actually never had that.

606
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,650
Even it was a coincidence,

607
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,210
I could have my first real Christmas-like Christmas

608
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,390
for just Irie-kun and I alone.

609
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,960
I feel like I'm dreaming.

610
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,810
Maybe it's the most pleasing present

611
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,670
I've ever gotten for Christmas.

612
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,450
Love, love.

613
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,250
Love, love, love.

614
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,190
Satomi.

615
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,640
Merry Christmas.

616
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,130
- No way!
- Yes way!

617
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,250
Welcome, what can I do for you to day?

618
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,410
Welcome.

619
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,450
Santa! Santa?

620
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,140
Oh, Just this way.

621
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,100
Okay, it's...

622
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,090
right here

623
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,670
You've got it!

624
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,770
It's the last one too.
That's so lucky!

625
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,430
YES!

626
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,520
That's it. I'm going to buy a cake.

627
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,860
'Cause,
Despite this 'Christmasy' feeling in the air...

628
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,430
It's just too much of a waste when there's no cake.

629
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:18,620
There's probably one at a corner store right now, so I've got to...

630
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,350
There's one.

631
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,580
What?

632
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,290
Cake.

633
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,950
Merry Christmas!

634
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,070
What? Oh my god!
Why? Why? Why?

635
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,130
It's a present from Santa Claus.

636
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,930
Yeah right.

637
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,380
Then... is it from you...?

638
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,040
Who else would bring it?

639
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,850
Did you possibly think of me

640
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,950
and bring this cake back for me?

641
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,870
You have a really over-inflated ego.

642
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,750
The cake seller cried and clung onto me.

643
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,430
The seller's shift won't end until the last one is sold.

644
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,580
Wait for me, Kotoko! You'll be stuffing your face with delicious food!

645
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,080
Merry Christmas!

646
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,310
Make a wish!

647
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,180
That's for birthdays.

648
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,500
Huh?

649
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,980
For birthdays?

650
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,660
Let's surprise her.

651
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,440
Naoki, thank you.

652
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,030
I didn't do this for you.

653
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,950
But this cake is for two.

654
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,700
What a coincidence.

655
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,900
Hey, I'll give you this Santa.

656
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,980
Whatever.

657
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,410
What, it's dark.

658
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,460
Just make a wish anyway.

659
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,010
C'mon.

660
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,880
You make the wish.

661
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,420
Really?

662
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:16,340
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

663
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,240
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

664
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,600
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

665
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:31,110
♫ I realized many things ♫

666
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,130
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

667
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,900
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

668
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:42,370
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

669
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,550
♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

670
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:53,200
♫ your smile, and today ♫

671
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,200
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

672
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:01,390
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

673
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,380
♫ Above all, there's the irreplaceable time, ♫

674
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,790
♫ your smile, and surely tomorrow as well ♫

675
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,940
♫ Your memories and your future ♫

676
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:18,160
♫ Hold onto them tightly, so they won't be ruined ♫

677
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,330
♫ More than anyone else, ♫

678
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:28,870
♫  I always want to walk by your side ♫

[Preview]
- Will you marry into Irie-kun's family?
- No way!

680
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,500
Congrats on beginning your second year of college!

681
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:39,830
There's a new rival that has entered college.

682
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,930
It's about time for you to step up to the challenge.

683
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,460
I think you will be a great restaurant owner.

684
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,240
I think she would be your ideal wife.

685
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,570
That's enough.

686
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,290
And that's why I left this place!

687
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,460
Irie-kun!

688
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:54,120
Why didn't you tell that to your dad?

689
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,640
So until then, you can't tell anyone, either.

690
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,560
You should find someone that you really love

691
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,210
and be happy...
