1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,840
You fucking bastard!

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,920
- Irie-kun.
- Sorry, that's it for today.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,320
I am...running together with Irie-kun.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,260
Like a dream.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,750
I'm saying that,

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,410
I'm not opposed to us living in the same house.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,800
That means... you don't,

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,680
hate me at all?

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,590
You caused trouble for me.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,960
However, I don't hate you.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
No way, I disagree with this.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,880
At last Kotoko-chan return back home, and now Naoki is going to leave?

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,440
Give it a try.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,690
Thank you very much.

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,110
Well, I think I should go now.

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,000
Naoki-chan, take good care of yourself, okay?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,110
Eat lots of vegetables too, also...

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,350
I got it, I got it.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,560
Bye.

20
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,360
Oh no, he really left.

21
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,690
- Irie moved out?!
- Yeah.

22
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,840
He got himself an apartment.
Then he's going to work part-time to earn
money for his rent.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,600
Do you know where he lives now?

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,950
I don't know.

25
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,210
How about his work?

26
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,240
What type of job is it?

27
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,960
I don't know either of them.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,280
What?
That makes him sounds like a stranger.

29
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,920
Kin-chan?
What is this?

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,640
It's a celebration.
Hasn't Irie moved out?
Nothing could be better than this.

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,660
It's seem like I've won the match.

32
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,940
Irie finally decided to back off from Kotoko.

33
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,860
Look here, Kin-chan.

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,700
Don't you understand Kotoko's feeling?

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,200
- What are you still doing here? Go away!
- Kotoko, I love you!

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,990
I'll help you eat this.

37
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,490
I can't believe that Kin-chan.

38
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,680
But... I think Kin-chan is kinda right about that.

39
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,870
- Satomi!
- But Irie is also a man, too.

40
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,200
If he was interested in Kotoko for even just a little,
he wouldn't move away from home.

41
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,950
Look at Kin-chan.
Everyone wants to be with the person they love.

42
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Just right after he said me that he didn't hate me.

43
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,280
Irie-kun just moved away from home.

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,580
Is he trying to avoid me?

45
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,820
What is he thinking about?

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,130

[Mischievous Kiss: Love in Tokyo]

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,040
Episode 9
[Time to Give Up, My Love]

67
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,680
In the end, you still come here spying on him?

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,960
Because I can only see him at school.

69
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,250
Ahhh,

70
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,290
Kotoko, you're really stupid!

71
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,650
- That's right, Baka.(Stupid)
- Really.

72
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,470
What do you mean 'baka'?
- B- A- K- A, Baka.
- That's right.

73
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,470
B-A- K- A.

74
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,150
It's baka!
- Yeah, baka, baka, baka, baka!.
- No, I'm not.

75
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,980
Oh, Are you Irie's...

76
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,540
Hello.

77
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,330
I'm sorry, but Irie already left.
He went to work.

78
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,710
Um, Do you know what kind of work does he do?

79
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,820
We asked him the same too, but he didn't tell us.

80
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,070
Irie can sometimes be so secretive.

81
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,620
Sorry about that.

82
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,440
It's okay.

83
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,910
Are they brothers?

84
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,530
- I think they both twins.
- Really? Twins?

85
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,240
Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

86
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,620
Aihara Kotoko!

87
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,760
Ahh, Aihara Kotoko!

88
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,620
These balls also have feelings...If you slack off collecting them,

89
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,660
you can't become like a regular player!

90
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,480
Keep that in mind!!

91
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,770
- You!
- Yes!

92
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,690
Are you cold or hot? Make up your mind!
Aren't you a member of the tennis club?!

93
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,570
You there!!

94
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,650
There's no way he'll come

95
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,900
I'm sorry, this is all we got.

96
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,560
Mom went out on some urgent business today

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,420
Not at all, it's delicious.

98
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,610
Really? Please, eat a lot.

99
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,990
Thank you for the food.

100
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,340
What's wrong, Yuki? You didn't eat much.

101
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,320
I don't have any appetite.

102
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:19,320
Oh, really? In that case... this happens

103
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:27,150
Because Naoki left, Yuki's probably lonely, too.

104
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,490
Even though he was cold to me...
Even though he said sarcastic things to me

105
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,950
He was always with me.

106
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:57,650
I feel like the distance between Irie-kun and I
keeps growing bigger.

107
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,150
-Kotoko-chan!!!
- Yes

108
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,410
Kotoko-chan, Kotoko-chan!

109
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,400
I found it!

110
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,590
What did you find?

111
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,300
What do you mean, 'what did you find?'
What else can it be besides Naoki's workplace!

112
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,930
But how?

113
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,810
It's impossible to hide anything from me.

114
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,860
What are you, Mrs. Irie?

115
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,870
The important thing is, will you go,

116
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,380
to spy on Naoki's workplace with me?

117
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,400
I'll go! l want to go too!

118
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,370
Yuki, were you spying on us?

119
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,770
I'm worried about my brother more than Kotoko.

120
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,720
I want to see him, too.

121
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,780
Alright, alright!
Now, let the three of us go spy on him!

122
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,400
Okay! Okay!
Okay! Okay!

123
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
Okay! let's go!

124
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,900
... also, riccota cheese pancake; banana bread; also what's good is

125
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,900
original bran toast.

126
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,260
Low, low fat milk.

127
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,820
Cafe latte, I would like cafe latte with low fat milk.

128
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,750
Uh... yeah? What?

129
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,700
- Shall I?
- Please.

130
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,150
Hi, may I take your order?

131
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,880
Hi, I like cafe latte please with the low fat milk.

132
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,730
Would you like anything else?

133
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,550
So cool...

134
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,500
That's my brother, alright.

135
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,610
Young man! Young man, here, please!

136
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,510
Yes?

137
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,550
Oh, um, not you,

138
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,760
but that guy.

139
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,490
Young man!

140
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,270
- Have you decided what you want to eat?
- Hmm, not quite...

141
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,870
I know it's you in disguise, Mother.

142
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,740
How did you know?

143
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,900
If I couldn't figure it out, then I'm not sensitive enough.

144
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,840
It's your doing

145
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,500
'cause you wouldn't tell us the address
of your new employment.

146
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,390
This is my workplace, so private conversation is prohibited.

147
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,860
For the order, two coffees and one orange juice is good, right?

148
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,780
Good.

149
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,230
Hm?

150
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,150
Bro's gone.

151
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,190
Did he go to the bathroom?

152
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,490
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

153
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,190
Where is Irie Naoki?

154
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,190
Irie-kun's left for the day.

155
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,210
He left without even saying a word to us!

156
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,780
In the end, he didn't inform us of his new residence, huh.

157
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,480
Mrs. Irie, let's go back home.

158
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,580
Seeing that Naoki is doing well should be enough.

159
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,070
You're right.

160
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,440
Kotoko-chan, look at that!

161
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,500
"Waitress Wanted"

162
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,870
Mrs. Irie, I'm going to work at this place! Then, I can be at Naoki's side...!

163
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, please do, Kotoko-chan!

164
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Yes!
Excuse me!

165
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,840
I'm interested in that!

166
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,170
"Waitress Wanted"

167
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,360
Please come this way.

168
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,780
Boss. Another person is interested in working here part-time.

169
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Oh, I'm sorry... but I've actually given this person the job.

170
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,580
Matsumoto-san!

171
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,330
Wow, what a coincidence, Kotoko-san!

172
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,650
Matsumoto-san,
how did you know Irie-kun was working here?

173
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,530
I learned about it . . .

174
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,400
from him.

175
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,910
HIM?!

176
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,540
Mrs. Irie . . .

177
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,840
Kotoko-chan! How was the interview?

178
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,130
It was a bust.

179
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,880
The girl that's together with Irie-kun in The Department of Science and Technology?

180
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,230
She got in.

181
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,570
Could it be . . .

182
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,110
That female

183
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,130
Matsumoto Yuko.

184
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,970
Mrs. Irie, how long have you known...?

185
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,560
I told you, the world's information is my information!

186
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:19,760
Sure, she's kinda pretty, she has a good body, and her intelligence isn't terrible either,

187
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,640
but she will. Not. Work. She's not Naoki's type, you know.

188
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,460
- Is that so?
- Of course.

189
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm sure she knows that too. That why she tried to get the job. She's approaching him desperately.

190
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,820
If you say it that way...
I too, applied for the same job.

191
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,260
Anyway, you're the best for Naoki.

192
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,780
There's no mistake since, I, who raised him,
is telling you this.

193
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,870
Such a woman, drive her away!

194
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,890
Mrs. Irie, the knife...

195
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,970
This? I was cutting a mackerel.

196
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,080
Ah... Mackerel.

197
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,710
Matsumoto Yuko is working in the same place as Naoki Irie?!

198
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:12,840
Yeah, and what's more, she said Irie-kun himself
told her that he worked there.

199
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,370
But why the guys from the science and engineer department said that ?

200
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,490
We asked him too, but he didn't want to tell us.

201
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,780
Irie can be so secretive sometimes.

202
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
That's right.

203
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,960
He didn't even tell his family where he worked.

204
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,330
That means that Naoki told Yuko about his job himself!

205
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,690
It doesn't make sense.

206
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,620
When a person changes his life,

207
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,040
there is always something that triggers it.

208
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,320
For example, you started playing tennis because of Irie.

209
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,660
That means, Irie started living alone because of...

210
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,410
Matsumoto Yuko ?

211
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,340
There's no way! Naoki said that he didn't hate me!

212
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,780
Well, we don't know for sure, but... there's a difference between

213
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,130
not hating someone and liking someone. You get me?

214
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,700
Up till now he really didn't like girls, did he?
Then that means...

215
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,800
If it wasn't something so big... I don't think he would move out of his comfortable house,

216
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,200
don't you think?

217
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,240
I agree.

218
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,660
What's wrong?

219
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,540
It's unusual that you came to the shop instead of going home.

220
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,850
Well, I was just thinking it's been a while since I've had Dad's food.

221
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,420
You used to come here all the time when you were a kid.

222
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,100
Wow! This looks delicious!

223
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,130
Kotoko...Let's eat together.

224
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,670
- You will eat with me in the back.
- But I want to...

225
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,780
No, you can't...

226
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,400
Thanks for the food.

227
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,990
Delicious!

228
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,770
I know.

229
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,650
That this is about Naoki.

230
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,400
Irie-chan said it wasn't because of us but he moved out right after we came back.

231
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,700
It concerned me, too.

232
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,250
It looks like Irie-kun dislikes me more than I first thought.

233
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,170
What are you even talking about?

234
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,780
You are the Kotoko who will try her hardest no matter what.

235
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,640
You can do this. No need to cry if you still can do something about it.

236
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,770
Okay, okay! But I really did come here to have your food.

237
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,240
This is the best!

238
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,820
Thank you for the food!

239
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
See ya later, Kotoko.

240
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,280
Yeah! I'll swing by again.

241
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,160
- Boss.
- Hm?

242
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,880
Can I ask you something?

243
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,500
What?

244
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,370
Kotoko is having a hard time right now.

245
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,570
She isn't a little girl anymore.

246
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,910
I shouldn't tell her what to do.

247
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:57,380
Until the moment that she really needs my help

248
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,980
I will be waiting here to protect her.

249
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,820
That's what being a parent is like.

250
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:16,110
Don't worry about other people. You should
become a man to put your parents' minds at ease.

251
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,370
Yes.

252
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,900
Alright, let's do this!

253
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,050
Need some help?

254
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,660
Thank you.

255
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,860
I'll have to wait until his job finishes, won't I?

256
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,600
He's coming!

257
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,530
Okay!

258
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,030
He's... waiting for someone?

259
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,650
No. Way.

260
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,770
- Sorry for keeping you.
- Mm.

261
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,650
Ah, I see. You ride this and get home.

262
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,690
That makes sense. It's okay. Let's go.

263
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,030
How long are you gonna be with him?!

264
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,360
Is Irie-kun's apartment near to Matsumoto-san's house?

265
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,440
Did he move out because he wanted to live near to Matsumoto-san?

266
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,040
No, it's near to Tonan University.

267
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,740
It's normal to get a place near school far an easy commute.

268
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,670
What would you like for tonight's dinner?

269
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,560
I wasn't thinking about it.

270
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,260
- Well, how about... beef stroganoff?
- Yes.

271
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,650
Really?

272
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,110
They're going to make (beeft est bourgeoise)?

273
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,870
Matsumoto?

274
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,120
Ehhhhhh?! They're living together?!

275
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,290
Good morning...

276
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,830
What's wrong, Kotoko-chan?

277
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,080
Hm?

278
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,160
Nothing's wrong...?

279
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,920
But your face...

280
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,010
Ahh, I didn't really sleep yesterday...

281
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,840
Now you look like a ghost more than an idiot.

282
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,700
My brother hates those kinds of girls.

283
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,790
Thanks for the warning. I guess I'd better be careful.

284
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,330
Huh?

285
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,820
Well. I'll be going.

286
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,410
Kotoko-chan! What about breakfast?

287
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,690
I wonder if she's alright...

288
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,030
Living together?!

289
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,450
They wouldn't go... that far, would they?

290
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,030
But, uh, hey, you know, it could always be a misunderstanding.

291
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,110
Maybe your intuition is wrong.

292
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,050
I waited for three hours.

293
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:40,580
- T-three hours?!
- That... that's a bit much...

294
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,980
Neither Irie-kun nor Matsumoto-san left.

295
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,100
If he was just taking her home, it's too long.

296
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,370
- They are certainly linving together.
- Plus, he is living with her family.

297
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,930
Which means her parents have approved of their relationship.

298
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,160
Now it makes sense that Irie was hiding his new address from Oba-san.

299
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,130
A college student leaves his house and goes to live with a woman?

300
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,620
He certainly can't tell that to his mom.

301
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,920
Kotoko... are you okay?

302
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,290
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

303
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,480
I should confess.

304
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,650
W-what? Kotoko!

305
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,410
Heyyy, Irie! It's been a while, huh?

306
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,990
I felt like working out a little.

307
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,070
Ah, Aihara's not here today. She looked pretty sick.

308
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,370
She is sick.

309
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,570
Her tennis skills haven't gotten any better,
but she was so tough.

310
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,690
She never missed a practice until today.

311
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,700
Irie-kun!

312
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,430
Let's practice together!

313
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,730
Sure.

314
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,080
See ya.

315
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,990
Bro!

316
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,570
Hey. How've you been?

317
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,150
Good. But what's wrong?

318
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,940
Nothing much.

319
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,480
Guess I missed people I haven't seen for awhile.

320
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,150
And I wanted to know how thing are to home.

321
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,920
Speaking of which... Kotoko's acting weird.

322
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,530
Kotoko? Why?

323
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,760
Not a clue. But her face was white and she looked really blehhh.

324
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,040
And she didn't even eat.

325
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,080
There is no reaction even when I bully her.

326
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,870
It's no fun. This is exactly like

327
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,530
"Pushing a noren curtain, clamping two tofu's together, hitting nail into rice grain".

328
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,330
Here we go!

329
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,510
There are Chinese, western dishes, and desserts.
With this much food, I'm sure you will eat something.

330
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,080
So Kotoko, don't hesitate, just eat as much as you want!

331
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,540
All of this is Kin-chan's treat for us!

332
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,770
Hey, how long are you gonna make that face?
If you don't feed yourself,

333
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,350
you won't find a new love.

334
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,810
I know it's been very hard for you.
But he's not the only man in this world.

335
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,970
That's right. Look around carefully.

336
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,450
A good looking man is in front of you!

337
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,350
Kin-chan! Don't market yourself now.

338
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,370
Yes, she's right. I went too far, too quickly.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry...

339
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,410
Kotoko, start with something that you can eat.

340
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,520
Here, here, here.

341
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,830
Thank you.

342
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:50,910
But I'm really not feeling hungry.

343
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,190
So... eat up.

344
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,340
Kotoko...

345
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,900
Are you okay, Kotoko?

346
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,100
Irie is going to pay for this.

347
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,570
Where are you going, Kin-chan?
- Of course to Irie's. I will show him...

348
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,120
Although you only work part-time, you
are an employee of the school.

349
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,590
If you hurt a student, you are going to get fired.

350
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,090
You won't be able to stay with Kotoko.

351
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,190
Bite your lip right now and leave Kotoko to us.

352
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,040
Right. That's right. We should eat these.
-Let's eat.

353
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,070
- We need some sugar.
- Sugar? We need some calcium.

354
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,620
- No, it's sugar
- Then let's eat the deserts.

355
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,310
Oh, Kotoko...

356
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,780
Kin-chan went to go get a car.

357
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,030
Doctor, how is Kotoko?

358
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,830
Fatigue and malnourishment. Get her something easy
to digest and plenty of rest.

359
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,970
Then she will be okay.

360
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,150
I called her family, so you two
can go home now.

361
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,950
Doctor, thank you very much.

362
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,440
Thank you.

363
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,860
She fainted although her condition isn't that severe. She
must have suffered some sort of psychological shock.

364
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,480
Psychological shock...

365
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,790
That bastard! We can't forgive him!

366
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,020
Irie Naoki!!

367
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,620
HAA!! HAIYA!!

368
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,620
GRRR!!

369
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,910
RROAR!!

370
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,230
Where's Irie Naoki?

371
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,490
Scram!!

372
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,860
Get away!!

373
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,120
Hey, let's talk!

374
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,020
We want to tell you something.

375
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,360
Who are you?

376
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,820
We went to the same school!

377
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,440
We're from the same hometown, you don't remember that?

378
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,350
I don't remember useless things like that.

379
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,990
YOU-MAKE-ME-FEEL-SICK.

380
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:02,410
Ah, I remember now. Kotoko's slaves or something...

381
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,330
Jinko-san and Satomi-san.

382
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,750
The Opposite!!

383
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,500
- I'm Jinko!
- I'm Satomi!

384
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,000
Whatever.

385
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,410
Look, this is about Kotoko.

386
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:17,170
Aren't you being horrible?

387
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,980
Lately, it's your fault

388
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,480
that Kotoko is so droopy.

389
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,660
And that's my fault?

390
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,200
You really don't know?! It's because of you living with–

391
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,950
–with her!

392
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,370
Poor thing. Kotoko followed you and Matsumoto-san

393
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,050
she even saw you with her own eyes!

394
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,490
This happened because she was waiting in front of that place for three hours!

395
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:46,220
With that crappy mood, waiting for you to come out,

396
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:51,280
Kotoko saw you sneaking into that apartment to live with her... How could you do such a terrible thing?!

397
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,520
Just tell her frankly how you really feel about her.

398
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,290
If you are a man, why don't you tell her directly?

399
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,490
Are you saying that I should tell her directly?

400
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,690
Well, please choose your words carefully.

401
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,960
That's right. Since you've fall in love with someone...

402
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,490
now you understand human feelings a little more?

403
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,810
Well, please don't make Kotoko suffer anymore.

404
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,280
We're not telling you to give up liking Matsumoto-san.

405
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:36,610
But if there is no hope for Kotoko,
I want you to help her give up on you.

406
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,320
We beg you.

407
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,940
We beg you.

408
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,340
Well. We just wanted to tell you that.

409
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,690
Okay, then!

410
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,400
Now I get it...

411
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,650
We're here.

412
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,340
Are you okay, Kotoko?

413
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,480
Yeah.

414
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,160
I'm okay.

415
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,860
Sorry. I know you had work...

416
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,730
Kotoko.

417
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,900
I'm always here.

418
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,990
Kin-chan...

419
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:59,150
Always, no matter what, I'll be by your side.

420
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,450
I'm here for you.

421
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,410
That's it. Hurry up and get better, okay?

422
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,070
Kin-chan...

423
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,490
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,160
It's not time for you to apologize.

425
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,360
Eat well and go to sleep early.

426
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,650
You... don't hate me?

427
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,740
You're difficult, but...

428
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,490
I don't hate you.

429
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,460
Hey, how long are you gonna make that face?

430
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,590
If you don't feed yourself, you won't find a new love.

431
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:01,520
I know it's been hard for you.
But he's not the only man in this world.

432
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,320
Kotoko, I'm here for you.

433
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,270
Ugh. What's up with me?

434
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:36,020
Kotoko-chan, are you alright? Should I drive you?

435
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,130
I'm really fine.

436
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,410
I'll be going, okay?

437
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,030
See you later!

438
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,500
I have to keep myself together.

439
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,850
Everything will be okay.

440
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,820
I can't give people around me anymore trouble.

441
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,240
Alright! Let's go!

442
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,360
Good morning.

443
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,030
Wait.

444
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,730
Come with me for a sec.

445
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,980
How's your new house?

446
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,270
Pretty good. It's spacious.

447
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,280
That kind of luxurious place...

448
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm sure it's spacious.

449
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,480
Are you eating well?

450
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,660
There's a buffet and I can cook my own food.

451
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,200
Just as I thought.

452
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,030
Hey.

453
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:05,250
I think it's wonderful you fell in love.

454
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,870
What are you saying out of the blue?

455
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:13,650
I've had a one-sided love for you, Irie-kun.

456
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,240
You might have thought I was a nuisance. But because I loved you, I could put all my effort in many things.

457
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,560
If I stayed like how I was before,
I couldn't have gotten into this school.

458
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,330
It might be a matter trivial for you,

459
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,770
but I remember that was such a big deal for me.

460
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,610
Can you get to the point?

461
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,280
What I'm saying is...

462
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,740
If you've come to like someone,
I'd like to celebrate that, is all.

463
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,660
Well, it would be a lie if I said I wasn't humiliated.

464
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,330
Irie-kun liking Matsumoto-san, and Matsumoto-san feeling the same way,

465
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,500
if that brings you happiness, I'm all for it!

466
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,940
I will even you support!

467
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,910
Na-san!
[affectionate, yet polite]

468
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,830
Who are you?

469
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,510
Are you... perhaps...

470
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,670
Kotoko Aihara?!

471
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,470
How do you know my name?

472
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,880
I knew it! Because you're exactly as I heard.

473
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,700
You do look dumb and like an idiot.

474
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,170
You're so rude! Who told you that?

475
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,080
Naoki-san and my sister?

476
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,740
'Sis?'

477
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,730
So you're saying... your sister is...?

478
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,520
Yes. Me.

479
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,570
Yuko Matsumoto?!

480
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:08,310
I'm Matsumoto Aiyako, a senior in high school.

481
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:13,190
Huh? Haven't you heard of Naoki-san's living situation?

482
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,150
Shall I tell you?

483
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:23,130
Naoki-san is, you see, is living in our house and - - -

484
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,650
I know that.

485
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,410
I know about them living together. Congrats, Matsumoto-san.

486
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:35,330
What are you talking about?
Naoki-san is tutoring at our house.

487
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,030
What?

488
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,150
Tutoring?!

489
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,660
I also want to go to Tonan University next year.

490
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,290
So Sis introduced us three weeks ago.

491
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,520
Since then, Naoki-san's been tutoring me.

492
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:53,820
Matsumoto's family pays me good. I get dinner free too.

493
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,370
Beef strogan...
Beef stro...

494
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:59,360
Huh?

495
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,990
How do you know that?
-Beef stroganoff!

496
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:14,070
What's wrong? Why are you crying? Are you okay?

497
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,060
She's kind of a strange girl...

498
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,250
Anyway, Naoki-san, Yuko,
can you start showing me the schoo?

499
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,650
I was looking forward to coming here today.

500
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,120
So it's only that.

501
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,740
So, your approval on Matsumoto-san and me

502
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,160
and support us ?

503
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,610
No, no, no, no! Now I'm strongly opposed, I completely object, I absolutely disapprove–

504
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,970
Be quiet.

505
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,570
I moved out to be alone, why would I live with someone?

506
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,320
See you later. Kotoko.

507
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,190
YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!

508
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,830
Matsumoto! Matsumoto! Matsumoto!

509
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:20,700
Oh, you guys!
There is a racket!

510
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,170
Where is Matsumoto Yuko? Where did she go?

511
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:29,360
I was wrong,
Irie-kun and Matsumoto-san weren't living together.

512
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,920
What ? Are they living together?
That Irie, I won't forgive him!

513
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,780
Oh, Sudo-san!

514
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:41,990
It's not like. Irie-kun is inattached!
Until now and from now on,

515
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,580
he's unattached!

516
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,950
So you should be happy too, Sudo-san.

517
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,220
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
However, good for you. Congrats!

518
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:58,920
But why did Matsumoto-san say that Irie-kun told her about his part-time job?

519
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,780
Huh?

520
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,910
I'm the one who told Matsumoto about Irie's part-time job.

521
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,540
I'm the one who introduced Irie to the restaurant..

522
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,810
Huh? Does that mean Matsumoto-san lied to me?

523
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,940
Does that mean Matsumoto-san lied to me?

524
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,690
How did you know that Irie-kun is working here?

525
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,360
The guy told me.

526
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:33,580
I see! I see! Sudo-senpai, you are a man, too.

527
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,510
So it was actually you!

528
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,040
Are you really okay?

529
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,140
I have no idea what you're talking about.

530
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,290
Everything is just fine and dandy!
I'm starving, please treat me to some eats!

531
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,750
Why? Why do I have to treat you?

532
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,290
Can you treat me for once?

533
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,910
We can't, I'm dirt broke!

534
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:57,210
She went into a store that had many hats ...

535
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,730
After all, I mistook that they were living together.

536
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,440
I'm really glad that it was a mistake.

537
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:13,110
But, why did Irie-kun start living alone?

538
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,810
Well, it's okay!

539
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,450
I see, it's okay.

540
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,300
- Is it all right?
- It's fine!

541
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,140
♫ My overgrown bangs are ♫

542
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,750
♫ gently shaken by the wind ♫

543
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,420
♫ It's still slightly chilly ♫

544
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,490
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

545
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,280
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

546
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:50,600
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

547
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,720
♫ I realized many things ♫

548
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:59,200
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

549
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,130
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

550
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:07,410
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

551
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,560
♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

552
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:17,810
♫ your smile, and today ♫

553
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,120
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

554
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,500
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

555
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,530
♫ Above all, there's the irreplaceable time, ♫

556
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,990
♫ your smile, and surely tomorrow as well ♫

557
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,000
♫ Your memories and your future ♫

558
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:43,190
♫ Hold onto them tightly, so they won't be ruined ♫

559
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,250
♫ More than anyone else, ♫

560
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:54,910
♫  I always want to walk by your side ♫

561
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,250
We are leaving!

562
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,150
Are you sure it will be okay with just two of you?

563
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,600
We will okay. It's only for one night.

564
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,180
- What's wrong?
-Yuki, hold on!

565
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,500
He needs to have surgery.

566
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,330
I'll find Irie and bring him to you.

567
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,220
Maybe Matsumoto-san know something.

568
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,680
We will get there no matter what.

569
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,380
The least you should have done
is, tell your family how to reach you.

570
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,310
This time I gave you trouble.

571
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,420
Where is Kotoko-chan?

572
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,470
Could it be that she is at Naoki's apartment?

573
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,480
Do you want to take a shower?

574
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,220
At a time like this, stop thinking something like that!
