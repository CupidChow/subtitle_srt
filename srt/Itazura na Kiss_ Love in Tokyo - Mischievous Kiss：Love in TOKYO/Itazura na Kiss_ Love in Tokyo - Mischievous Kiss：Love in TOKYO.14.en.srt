1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,170
-How is my father's condition?
-If he keeps pushing himself, at this rate he will suffer a myocardial infarction.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,960
I'll do it. I'm going to protect his company.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,430
If Irie-kun is feeling uneasy and needs help...

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,810
If there is something that I can do, I would do anything.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,580
At this rate, Pandai may have to undergo a merger.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,450
We need an enormous amount of financial support immediately.

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,260
This is Hokueisha's Chairman Oizumi
and his secretary, Mr. Yokoyama.

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,820
On behalf of my father

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,250
I would like to discuss the investment plan with you.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,840
My father is actually not doing well.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,170
If I take over the company,
all of the problems will be solved.

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,270
I'm delighted that you paid us
a visit at our company, Chairman.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,130
-Thank you very much for coming.
-Well, well...

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,010
I had something to do in this area today.

15
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,460
Are by alone today?

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,580
I came here to talk to you
about a personal matter, Naoki-kun.

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,140
Talk to me?

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,490
Naoki-kun, would you like to have
an arranged marriage meeting?

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,630
I know it's not the best time
since Mr. Irie is in the hospital...

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,670
I have a granddaughter.

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,600
She is your age and goes to
Seishin Women's College.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,560
It's a really prestigious school.

23
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,050
What do you think, Naoki-kun?

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,280
Would you at least like to meet her?

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,950
You are young.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,380
I'm sure you need time
to think about it.

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,450
After discussing it with your parents
please give me your answer in the next few days.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,680
We will talk about the
investment plan afterward.

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,810
I'm sorry for visiting you
without notice.

30
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,100
Please don't apologize.

31
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,350
Well then, Naoki-kun.
Please consider this carefully.

32
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,600
Yes.

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,840
Thank you very much.

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,190
Naoki-san.

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
This meeting is...

36
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,720
going to be a great advantage
for the company, isn't it?

37
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,500
What is this all about, Naoki?

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,580
Wait, Honey. Calm down.

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,510
However, out of the blue you're having
an arranged marriage meeting with...

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,240
The Chairman's granddaughter?
-What is going on?

41
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,090
Nothing.

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,010
Don't tell me that...

43
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,330
you are doing this for the financial support?

44
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,570
We didn't tell them that we were coming.
Don't you think Daddy will be surprised?

45
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,420
What should we do?
It might be bad for his heart if we surprise him.

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,880
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,310
If he sees Yuki-kun's face,
he will get better right away!

48
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,580
Don't underestimate us!

49
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:38,010
I don't want to protect my company
by sacrificing your life.

50
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,890
He's right. Marriage? I won't allow this.

51
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,420
"Marriage?"

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,650
Naoki is?

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,510
I'm proud of myself for building Pandai
this big in just one generation.

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,410
So don't take us the wrong way.

55
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,430
You have to marry
someone that you really love.

56
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,260
I like her.

57
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,490
I saw her in a picture.

58
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,060
She was my type.

59
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,970
Naoki!!

60
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,530
-Are you serious?
-Yuki!

61
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,620
Are you really getting married?
But...

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,540
Kotoko-chan. You are here too, Mr. Aihara.

63
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,250
Irie-kun.

64
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,360
Is it true that you're going to
have an arranged marriage meeting?

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,950
Yes.

66
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,670
This coming Sunday.

67
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,130
Since my father is not doing well,

68
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,670
we are going to have a casual meeting.

69
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,980
I need you to come with me, Mom.

70
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,540
Please.

71
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,290
Oh no...

72
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,430
Irie-kun is going to have an
arranged marriage meeting...

73
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,220
I can't believe this.

74
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,560
What am I...

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,170

That punk Irie is going to have
an arranged marriage meeting?

The other person is the granddaughter
of their business partner.

97
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,840
That's like a marriage of convenience!

98
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,040
Does that still happen nowadays?

99
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,980
I don't know.

100
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,360
Irie-kun said he liked the girl.

101
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,190
I'm sorry, but I should go.

102
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,430
Oh, do you think Kotoko is okay?

103
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,220
There is no way that she is okay.

104
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,310
Don't you know how many years
she had a crush on Irie?

105
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,800
You are right.

106
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,020
But I didn't think that damn Irie would have
an arranged marriage meeting.

107
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,050
That punk Irie, I can't forgive him.

108
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,140
Really.
How much does he have to toy with Kotoko until he is satisfied?

109
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,450
Well, actually Kotoko is the one
who is toying with her own feelings.

110
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,040
But what about Kotoko's feelings?

111
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,190
She has been working so hard for him.

112
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,580
But he's going to have an arranged
marriage meeting with another girl?

113
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,960
Kin-chan, you almost sound like...

114
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,920
you want Kotoko and Irie to be a couple.

115
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,590
That's not what I'm saying!

116
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,670
I just want to see Kotoko smiling.

117
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,650
If I take over the company,

118
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,580
all of the problems will be solved.

119
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,070
But your dream is to become a doctor, isn't it?

120
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,380
It's hasn't been long since I had that dream.

121
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,980
So you're going to give it up?

122
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,460
Irie-kun . . .

123
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,390
At that moment, I felt like

124
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,650
our hearts were connected, but . . .

125
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,380
Ah, I broke it.
Ouch.

126
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,460
Are you okay, Kotoko-chan?

127
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,140
Oh no, you're bleeding!

128
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,270
It looks painful.

129
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,410
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm sorry. I was spacing out.

131
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,020
It's because of Naoki's
arranged marriage meeting, isn't it?

132
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,260
I can't believe him.

133
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,960
But I still think you should be
Naoki's wife, Kotoko-chan.

134
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,150
Nevertheless, it's something that
Irie-kun has already decided on.

135
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,110
About that...

136
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,200
No matter how I look at it, I just can't
believe he was telling us the truth.

137
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,850
About the company, too.

138
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,410
I admit that I was hoping

139
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,760
Naoki would take over Pandai.

140
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,740
But I've been watching him
working at the company...

141
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,260
I feel like something is wrong.

142
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,960
I said to myself, "This is not what
Naoki really wants to do."

143
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,990
I think Naoki feels responsible for
the fact that my husband collapsed.

144
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,790
That's why he is sacrificing himself
and trying to save the company.

145
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,320
But do you think he would
go as far as getting married?
That's changing his life.

146
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,620
When he starts thinking about something,
he gets obsessed with the idea.

147
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,600
That's why...

148
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,080
I have a great idea.

149
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,390
A great idea?

150
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,790
I heard that Irie-kun is going to have
an arranged marriage meeting.

151
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,350
The girl is a granddaughter of the chairman
of a company named Hokueisha.

153
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,790
Do you know him?

154
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,120
Of course I do.

155
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,100
Don't you read the newspaper?

156
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
Chairman Oizumi is one of the big shots
of the financial world.

157

He has influence on many politicians.
He is the boss of the Japanese business world.

158
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,260
I didn't know it was the granddaughter
of such an important person.

159
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,630
Now that you mention it. I heard she has attended
Seishin Women's School since kindergarten.

160
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,610
I see.

161
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,100
She is a real princess, huh?

162
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,270
Irie-kun said he liked her right away
when he saw a picture of her.

163
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,990
She must be beautiful.

164
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,030
I don't like it.

165
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,480
Right?

166
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,650
Why does the perfect girl appear
out of nowhere to take Irie-kun?

167
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,310
I can't let her take him.

168
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,310
Well, Mrs. Irie might be able
to do something about this.

169
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,450
Hmm? Mrs. Irie?

170
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,460
What are you talking about?

171
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,270
Oh, me?

172
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,410
Oh, it's nothing! Nevermind!

173
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,300
What do you mean "nothing?"
Hurry up and tell me.

174
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,240
I'm sorry, It's top secret...

175
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,670
that she has a plan to ruin the meeting.
Ah!

176
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,800
I see...

177
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,230
"Ruin the meeting," huh?

178
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,880
You two never change.

179
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,910
What is it?

180
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,450
But...

181
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,140
Only this time, I will join you.

182
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,070
What?

183
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,280
[The Day of the Arranged Marriage Meeting]

184
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,170
This way, please.

185
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,810
Oh, Naoki-kun and Mrs. Irie.
I've been waiting for you.

186
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,420
We are sorry for making you wait.

187
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,530
Please sit down.

188
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm sorry for doing this when
Mr. Irie is in the hospital.

189
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,340
As for our side, only my
granddaughter and I are here, too.

190
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,790
We shall have a formal meeting
with her parents...

191
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,200
when Mr. Irie gets better.

192
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,160
On another day.

193
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,700
Oh my, I wonder if that day will ever come.

194
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,100
Mother!

195
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,930
One, two. One, two.

196
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,650
Why do we have to wear this?

197
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:16,750
We have no choice. This is the only way
that we wouldn't look suspicious in the garden.

198
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,530
Look, over there.

199
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,240
Hmm

200
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,170
How does she look?
The granddaughter of Chairman Oizumi.

201
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,740
It looks like she is not there yet.

202
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,430
Wha is she doing?

203
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,260
Sahoko is getting ready right now.

204
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,660
She will be here soon.

205
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,330
I'm sorry for being late.

206
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,830
Oh Sahoko, we've been
waiting for you.

207
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,740
Oh my.

208
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,660
You are from...

209
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,470
Are you OK?

210
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,430
Do you remember me?

211
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,600
I never forget a beautiful lady.

212
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,110
Great, you two have met before.

213
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,710
It's simple then.

214
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,890
Sahoko, you should sit down.

215
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,840
Hey.

216
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,570
What are you doing?
You shouldn't space out.

217
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,620
Let me see.

218
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,260
Hmph, she might be pretty,
but she probably has no brains.

219
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,530
You are right! You are right!
Alright, let's get closer and
listen to their conversation!

220
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,040
Crawl and advance!
Let's go!

221
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,300
Are you serious?

222
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,200
I can't do this.

223
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,270
What is your hobby, Sahoko-san?

224
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,860
I'm not good at anything special.

225
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,250
I'm only good at cooking,
sewing and crafting.

226
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,130
very boring things.

227
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,530
Yes, indeed.

228
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,270
Boring.

229
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,410
Mrs. Irie, nice!

230
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,020
Shh, they can hear you.

231
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,990
It's not something that
I should say, but...

232
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,690
Sahoko is quiet and perfect as a lady.

233
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,390
She is like a modern version of
an old traditional Japanese woman.

234
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,640
Sounds very nice.
I like quiet women.

235
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,210
Wow, an "old traditional Japanese woman?"

236
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,360
So old.

237
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:37,040
No wonder you seem like
you are missing your youth.

238
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,870
Um... Naoki-san,
what do you like to do?

239
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,090
Well...

240
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,290
I like to read books.

241
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,430
And I play tennis a little bit.

242
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,470
"A little bit?"

243
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,250
I've heard that you won many competitions.

244
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,340
That's amazing.

245
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,330
I can teach you next time.

246
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,170
-What?
-Huh?

247
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,150
I'm glad to hear that.

248
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,890
But I'm very bad, so you might get fed up with me.

249
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm sure he will be fed up.

250
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,850
Mother!

251
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,060
Well, my son, Naoki is very mean.

252
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,740
He looks down on people who don't
get it right after teaching them once.

253
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,980
Not only that, in an obvious way!

254
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,320
-Mrs. Irie, you are amazing.
-Yeah.

255
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,440
Actually, she is the one who is obvious.

256
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,520
You excel in academics and sports.
And you are so handsome.

257
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,690
I'm sure you are very popular among women.

258
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,840
Not so much.

259
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,490
Yes, he is very popular.

260
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,690
But, please do not worry.
He has never had any
relationships with women.

261
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,780
Really?

262
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,510
He must be straight-laced.

263
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,240
Yes, he is very straight-laced.

264
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,860
He's even rejected a love letter from
a girl who wrote one.

265
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,560
She gathered her courage together
and gave him the letter.
He turned her down in front of everyone.

266
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,250
He really is very straight-laced.

267
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,910
Was she talking about you?

268
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

269
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,570
I didn't know he hated you so much.

270
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,270
But...

271
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,890
it's better than a man who would
put on a nice face to everyone.

272
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,080
I think a man is more attractive
when he is a little bit cold.

273
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,120
You are absolutely right.

274
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,820
And you don't have to worry about cheating.

275
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,800
But, that doesn't mean he has never had a girl around him.

276
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,130
Actually, there is one girl who is the same age as Naoki.

277
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,970
They lived together for three years.

278
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,000
Enough already.
What do you mean by "lived together"?

279
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,990
-It's called "sharing a house".
-It's the same.

280
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,200
Oizumi-san, there is a reason.

281
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,050
That's right.

282
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,380
We might end up having your precious
granddaughter marry into our family.

283
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,850
You should know our circumstances, too.

284
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,000
It is a fact that there is a girl who is
the same age as Naoki living in the house.

285
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,830
Although we may say he is straight-laced,
he is also young.

286
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,900
I can't guarantee you that nothing
has happened between them.

287
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,920
Sahoko-san, would you like to go the garden?

288
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,260
Oh, that's a good idea.

289
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,730
Just Sahoko-san and I!

290
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,900
Oh, I should have noticed earlier.

291
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,530
Please, enjoy each other's company.

292
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,240
-Let's go.
-Yes.

293
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,150
Ow, my back hurts.

294
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm sorry, my mother said many rude things to you.

295
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,840
It's okay.

296
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,570
I can tell your mother likes her.

297
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,510
The woman who lives with you.

298
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,160
She is the daughter of my father's best friend.

299
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,060
Our families are friends.

300
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,590
That's why my mother said things like that.

301
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,020
But the person who likes her is not me.

302
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,160
It's my mother.

303
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,040
I hope your mother likes me, too.

304
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,320
Ah, but before that,
I hope you like me, Naoki-san.

305
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,640
Does that mean that you like me?

306
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,110
Since the moment we met in front of the elevator.

307
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,230
What a coincidence....
It's the same for me.

308
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,980
Oh my.

309
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,140
I'm pissed.

310
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,680
Look at their mood.

311
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,850
Hey, you.
What happened to Strategy 1?

312
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,910
Yes, roger!

313
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,210
Let's move on!

314
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,230
The secret weapon of
Strategy 1 is this sprinkler!

315
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,140
When they get close to it, we'll turn it on!

316
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,090
Then her kimono will get soaked.
She will have to go home.

317
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,230
Isn't it too easy?

318
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,030
A simple method works better.

319
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,120
Yes, let's go!

320
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,120
I've heard that the oldest bonsai tree here is over 500 years old.

321
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,380
-That old?
-Yes.

322
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,080
They are coming.

323
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,300
-Now!
-Yes!

324
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,970
Anyway, what a beautiful day.

325
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,860
I would love to play in the water.

326
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,790
-Huh?
-Huh?

327
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,160
I didn't think you would say that, Sahoko-san.

328
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,960
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you a klutz?
They already passed!

329
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,640
- Hey, let me do it.
-That's strange.

330
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,260
Hey, what is going on?

331
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,610
This switch doesn't work at all!

332
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,040
Hmm?

333
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,780
I think it's a sprinkler malfunction.

334
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
Let's keep walking.

335
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,400
Yes.

336
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,470
Oh gosh... It stopped.

337
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,330
Geez, why do I have to go through this?

338
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,350
Stupid!

339
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,930
Let's put ourselves together and try Strategy 2!

340
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,850
Let's go!

341
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,000
My eyes... It hurts.

342
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,720
All your pranks are something that elementary kids would do.

343
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,110
But aren't they disgusting?

344
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,450
They are.

345
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,490
Well,

346
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,480
when that Sahoko girl walks over there, I will throw this on her.

347
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,040
Then she will scream

348
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,590
and fall into the water.

349
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,730
It serves her right.

350
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,200
But do you think this is too much?

351
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,780
Geez, You are a real pushover, aren't you?

352
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:58,320
That's why Irie-kun has never turned to you.

353
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,500
I have nothing to say back to you.

354
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,690
I'm the same, too.

355
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,600
Here they come
-Hurry up!
-Wait, wait!

356
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,340
Geez, she will pass again.

357
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,150
-I'll do it. I'll do it.

358
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,270
Hurry!

359
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,330
Yes!

360
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,630
Don't worry, I'm here for you.

361
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,670
-What?
-What?

362
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,440
Oh, it looks like someone fell into the pond.

363
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,680
I think they are the cleaning ladies.

364
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,830
I assume they are cleaning the pond.

365
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,880
Let's go.

366
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,910
You had some bad water accidents, Kotokoo-chan.

367
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,650
I think I've been punished.

368
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,290
Since I tried to do mean things to such a beautiful girl.

369
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,050
You're talking about Sahoko-san, right?

370
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,200
It's true. She was a little bit beautiful.

371
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,440
When did you take that?

372
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,190
But she is not Naoki's type at all.

373
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,130
Naoki needs stimulation in his life.

374
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,980
A girl who is too perfect and quiet...
I know he is going to feel unsatisfied right away.

375
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,200
I can easily tell.

376
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,830
But they looked like they really liked each other.

377
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,060
And not only that, I made a really good impression as a mean mother-in-law!

378
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm sure Chairman Oizuma is furious!

379
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,280
I don't think he will give his precious granddaughter
to a family with a mother-in-law like me!

380
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,120
I bet they are the ones who will refuse this.

381
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,620
It's them.

382
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,250
It's the phone call to tell us about the refusal!

383
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,530
Yes, I'm coming!

384
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,750
Hell, this is the Irie residence.

385
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,000
Chairman Oizumi?

386
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,900
It's from him.

387
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,300
I apologize for what my mother did today.

388
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,950
I see.

389
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,880
That's fine with me

390
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,500
Yes, please.

391
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,570
How was it?
Did they refuse?

392
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,600
He said Sahoko-san liked me,

393
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,210
so he wants to move forward.

394
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,400
What?

395
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,590
So I told him that we could move forward.

396
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,020
Naoki.

397
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,570
I like her.

398
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,430
So please don't try to ruin it like that again.

399
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,660
Mom

400
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,230
You, too.

401
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,070
Huh?

402
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,960
It was so obvious.

403
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,770
I'm sorry.

404
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,460
Naoki's serious. I don't believe this.

405
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,760
Since then, Sahoko-san has been calling him quite often.

406
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,980
They go on dates many time a week.

407
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,700
Mrs. Irie is frustrated because Irie-kun comes home late.

408
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,150
I see.

409
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,580
There is nothing that we can do.

410
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,330
Are you giving up?

411
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,350
Well, we are talking about Oizumi Sahoko.

412
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,800
There is no way that we can win.

413
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,270
But,

414
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,300
If I have to give up Irie-kun for someone...

415
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,670
I wish it was you.

416
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,410
Huh?

417
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:33,580
Because if it was you, he would regret it eventually.

418
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,650
He would think "I should have chosen Matsumoto back then."

419
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,910
Are you making fun of me?

420
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:51,570
I feel like I lost to that Sahoko girl who didn't even fight for it.

421
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,520
But in your case, I admit to your effort.

422
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:03,370
What you've been doing is so useless, but you try as much as possible.

423
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,540
You make me laugh.

424
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,310
Leave me alone.

425
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,820
I know...

426
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,640
that you kissed him.

427
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,240
Oh... but that was...

428
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,080
I'm rooting for you.

429
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:41,480
What was that?
Could it be a cheer?

430
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,170
I'm home.

431
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,240
Yes.

432
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,130
That's fine.

433
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,730
I will see you tomorrow.

434
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,890
Yes.

435
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,950
I'm looking forward to it.

436
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,490
I'm home.

437
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,630
Welcome back.

438
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,820
Are you going out with Sahoko-san tomorrow?
I'm just wondering . . .

439
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,710
I'm sorry
It's not my business, is it?

440
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,080
We are going to Omotesando.

441
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:43,300
-It's a solo show opening reception for
an artist that Chairman Oizumi supports.
- I see.

442
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,290
Are you going to follow me again?

443
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,760
Are you going to pretend
you are cleaning the toilets at the party?

444
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,420
Kin-chan.

445
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,390
Look, doesn't it look delicious?

446
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,640
Eat this and cheer up.

447
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,100
We told him that Irie started dating the girl from the arranged marriage meeting.

448
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,370
That's right.

449
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,750
After all, we can say that...

450
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,410
he is in fact dating her.

451
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,730
Here, have some.

452
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,480
-Here, here.
-Have some.

453
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,120
Here you go.

454
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,030
I'm going to borrow this.

455
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,610
Let me try a little.

456
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,050
Geez, if you eat it looking like that,

457
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,720
even delicious food will taste awful.

458
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,090
Kotoko, cheer up.

459
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,420
You would feel better if a heartless person like Irie got married.

460
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,600
He's right.

461
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,740
It's just...

462
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,100
I know this is just my imagination...

463
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,240
But lately, I felt like the distance

464
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:27,690
between Irie-kun and I got closer.

465
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,410
That's why...

466
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,610
I can't accept

467
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,170
the reality yet.

468
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,690
I know.

469
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,810
No matter what happened, I thought you two would be together.

470
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,730
Jinko. It's cruel to tell her that now.

471
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,580
Irie is getting along with the girl.

472
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,680
That's right.

473
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,140
This time around, it's not like before.

474
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,770
Because an arranged marriage is between two families.

475
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,960
You can't just say,

476
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,640
"I don't like her anymore" and quit.

477
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,340
That means Irie is aware of that and still wants to move forward.

478
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,100
You are right.

479
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,280
Ah, let's eat, okay?

480
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,110
Okay.

481
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,640
Have some, okay?

482
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,910
-No eating, no life, okay?
-Right

483
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,220
-Cheer up!
-Eat as much as you can!

484
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,580
It's good to eat sweet stuff.

485
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,370
All of the art work was amazing.

486
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,700
Did you think so too, Naoki-san?

487
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,140
That party was very peaceful.

488
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,230
I could tell what a great person the artist was.

489
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,000
You must be hungry since they only have a small buffet.

490
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,600
Would you like to have dinner with me at a restaurant?

491
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,180
I would love to.

492
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,870
Straight ahead, there is an Italian restaurant that my grandfather goes to all the time.

493
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,410
The restaurant that Chairman Oizumi likes...
I'm sure it's good.

494
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,140
Let's go there.

495
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,090
Naoki is late.

496
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,980
I'll go look for him.

497
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,270
No, don't.

498
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,370
It's dangerous for a girl to be walking around in the middle of the night.

499
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,260
But I don't think I can fall asleep.

500
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,190
I'll take a walk and stop by a convenience store to buy some juice.

501
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,730
Kotoko-chan.

502
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:56,820
No matter what she says, she still cares about Naoki.

503
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,700
Hey, Handsome man.

504
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,120
Are you on the way home from your date with the rich girl?

505
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,170
Hey you, wait!

506
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,780
Just how do you feel about Kotoko?

507
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
It's none of your business.

508
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,590
Yes, it is!

509
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,980
You have always been leading Kotoko on.

510
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,920
Kotoko is a precious person to me.

511
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,600
You've been toying with my precious person's feelings.

512
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,980
How can I keep my mouth shut?

513
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,650
The what are you going to do?

514
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,990
I will take Kotoko away from you.

515
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,710
No...

516
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,600
I will protect her.

517
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,650
So please don't bother us.

518
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,420
I'm sure you understand since you have a girl you want to marry.

519
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,450
If she is very precious to you...

520
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,510
Kotoko is very precious to me.

521
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,180
I can't stand looking at Kotoko

522
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,370
suffer so much.

523
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,270
What do you say?

524
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,860
Irie-kun, please say "Kotoko loves me"

525
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,660
You used to say that.

526
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,760
Please.

527
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,990
Do whatever you want.

528
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,010
Sure.

529
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,770
I will do whatever I want like you said.

530
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,540
So don't meddle anymore, got it?

531
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,820
This is a promise between men!

532
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,460
This time... is it really the end?

533
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,290
Do I have to give up on Irie-kun?

534
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,750
It's impossible.

535
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,430
Brother...

536
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,150
Are you really going to marry the woman
you had the arranged marriage meeting with?

537
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,350
What is it all of a sudden?

538
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,400
Please answer me.

539
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,960
It's probably going to happen.

540
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,040
Do you really love her?

541
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,960
What is going on, Yuki?

542
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,770
Please answer my question.

543
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,830
Because...

544
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,770
Because the person you love is...

545
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,640
Kotoko, right?

546
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,440
Because in the hospital room, you gave Kotoko...

547
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,590
a kiss - - -
-Next time...

548
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:27,250
I will introduce you to Sahoko-san.

549
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,520
She is beautiful and she is supposed
to be good at cooking.

550
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm sure you will like her.

551
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,060
She is a good match for me.

552
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,930
I'm sure everything will work out...

553
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,960
Good morning, Kotoko.

554
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,340
Oh, good morning, Kin-chan.

555
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,310
Are you going to work at the cafeteria?

556
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,170
Yeah.

557
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,110
Today's lunch special is...

558
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,710
chicken cutlet.
You like it, right?

559
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,070
I will give you an extra portion in secret.

560
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,360
So you have to come and eat.

561
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,850
Okay, thank you.

562
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,250
Hey...

563
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,950
Next Sunday...

564
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,830
If you have time...

565
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,030
Do you want to go out with me?

566
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,340
Oh, well...

567
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,680
I got tickets for a movie from a customer at Aihara.

568
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,810
I thought you might enjoy it for a change.

569
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,880
Uh... it's an action movie... you will feel exhilarated.

570
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,570
After all, you don't want to go out
with just two of us, right?

571
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,500
- Sure.
- How about Jinko - - -

572
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,060
What?

573
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,160
Sure. Let's go, just the two of us.

574
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,480
Uh, this means...

575
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,680
It's a date. Are you sure?

576
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,960
You helped me a lot with Mr. irie.

577
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:33,360
I want to thank you, so let's go on a date.

578
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,920
Okay.

579
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,780
Well, see you later then.

580
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,500
Alright!

581
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,080
I was told that the president will be
discharged from the hospital next week.

582
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,720
Congratulations.

583
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,770
Thank you very much.

584
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:15,270
About the arranged marriage meeting...

585
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,650
After the president settles down, with the presence
of parents from both families...

586
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,860
They want to have dinner and talk about future plans.

587
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,300
That's fine with me.

588
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,840
I appreciate your help.

589
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,700
Thank you very much, Naoki-san.

590
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,950
Chairman Oizumi promised us an
amount of financial support.

591
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,110
Now our company is safe.

592
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,080
Irie-kun and I are...

593
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,550
about to start walking our own paths.

594
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,990
And further down those paths

595
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,190
I wonder, what future awaits us?

[Preview]
Will you marry me?

617
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,400
What?

618
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,900
We are dating while considering marriage in the future.

619
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,300
I don't mix up my love and work life like someone else does.

620
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,750
Doesn't that depend on the person?

621
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,200
It was fun. Time flew by so quickly.

622
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,820
I decide about my own life.

623
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,500
I've wanted to talk to you.

624
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,850
We should move out of Iri-chan's house.

625
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,850
You should find a good guy soon.

626
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,400
No matter how much I'm hurt,

627
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,250
I decided by myself not to give up on my feelings for Irie-kun.
