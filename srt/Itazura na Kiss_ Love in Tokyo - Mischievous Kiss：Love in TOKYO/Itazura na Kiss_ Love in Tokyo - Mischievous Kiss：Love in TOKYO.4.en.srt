1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,860
The first love letter that I wrote in my life...

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,170
The letter that was never going to be read...

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,150
You're terrible! You read my letter?!

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,280
Isn't it all right if you become your brother's wife, Kotoko-chan?

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,650
Marriage is out of question.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,270
I don't understand people's feelings.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,710
You hate someone today, but ...
tomorrow, you might like that person.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,340
What are you saying? Please wait.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,880
Don´t worry. I have no intention of having a relationship with you .

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,080
Were you teasing me?

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,360
Nothing special happened
in the last summer of high school.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,660
And 'though nothing happened (between us)

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,560
I will always remember

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,180
the fragrance of the coffee
that I had with Irie-kun that morning.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,080
Time passes quickly.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,170
It was summer , then fall came,

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,130
and turned into winter ...

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,670
I'm glad that I managed to get accepted to a college.

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,710
But the relationship between Irie-kun and I

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,560
as usual . . .

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,990
hasn't made any progress.

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,340
It's cute! You look really good in it, Jinko.

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,600
I went with navy blue this year, since I went with yellow last year.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,580
That´s right. You look very grown-up.
-Jinko, Satomi!

25
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,340
Happy new year!

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,400
Happy new year, Kotoko!

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,550
Oh? You're wearing a kimono as well this year.

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,520
Yes, Irie-kun's mother helped me put it on.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,410
It's cute and fits you well.

30
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,700
Thank you. Oh?

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,100
Have you become chubbier, Jinko?

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,700
Hey, stop it, or I'll take it to heart!

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,260
But you know, when I thought I was free from studying for exams,

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,340
Christmas cake and osechi turn out to be so delicious.
(T/N: food eaten during New Year's)

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,580
I get it. But you know,

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,070
I'm glad that the three of us made it to the Tonan University.

37
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,130
That's true. In spring, we'll be university students.

38
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,530
Let's make this year a good one!

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,790
- Yes! Now, shall we go?
- Let's go.

40
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,440
- We have to get in line.
- Isn't it great?

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,110
I wish for a great college life!

42
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,170
I hope to find a boyfriend this year!

43
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,080
Kotoko is serious, right?

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,740
And it is so obvious what she is hoping for.

45
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,260
Let's draw our fortunes!

46
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,310
I'll take this one.

47
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,170
I'll get this one then.

48
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,850
Which one should I take? This one.

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,610
Oh!

50
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,240
Amazing! I got excellent luck!

51
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,210
- Me too!
- Same for me!

52
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,610
How amazing!

53
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,630
Wait!

54
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,290
"The person you're waiting for will come. Await them in anticipation."

55
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,250
Wow!

56
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,170
- What should I do?
- Mine is...

57
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,990
"You won't meet them, but get in contact with them." What's this?

58
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,200
"Ambition will not pay off."

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,710
What?

60
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,980
Brother.

61
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,560
Don't ever tell Kotoko...

62
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,400
about this.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,080
- But...
- Enough now!

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,770
Just don't talk about it.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,610
Brother.

66
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,460
Congratulations!

67
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,960
[Congratulations, Kotoko-chan
Accepted to Tonan University]

68
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,320
Here is to Kotoko-chan's
college acceptance! Cheers!

69
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,120
Congratulations!

71
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,590
Kotoko-chan, congratulations!

72
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,230
Let's dig in, everyone!

73
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,830
Thank you very much, everyone,
for having done this for me

74
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,480
- Not at all...
- Until recently, I thought that Kotoko is still a child.

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,410
You're already a college student now, aren't you?

76
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,810
I'm sure your mother is so happy in heaven.

77
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,010
- Daddy.
- I'm sorry.

78
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,240
Sorry, I'm sorry.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,780
Following Kotoko-chan, it's Naoki's turn to enter a college.

80
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,830
He's not stupid like Kotoko-chan.

81
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,980
He can go to the University of Tokyo without effort.

82
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,430
Yuki.

83
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,510
That's right

84
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,220
Here, Irie-kun. This is for you.

85
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:58,100
I was able to get into college because you helped
me with my studies.

86
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,110
It's something very small.

87
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,340
That is so sweet. Hurry and open it, Naoki.

88
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,990
What's this?

89
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,680
It's a head massager.

90
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,680
Irie-kun is taking the exam to go to the University of Tokyo, right?

91
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
He still needs to study so hard, so...

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,350
Looks like a whisk. It's for an old man.

93
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,290
Hey, Yuki.

94
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,350
Never mind that. Why don't you use it, Naoki?

95
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes, use it.

96
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,960
It's okay. Besides, it's not just the University of Tokyo...

97
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,780
I haven't decided if I want to go to any college.

98
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,950
Well, Yuki, let me use it.

99
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,230
How does this work?

100
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,260
It can't be. Irie-kun is such a genius . . .

101
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,890
that he can enter the University of Tokyo with no problem.

102
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,670
What's going on?

103
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,620
♫ ~ ♥ Hey, do you notice?

121
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,950
Mischievous Kiss: Love in Tokyo

122
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,590
Such a big mouth!

123
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,310
It's like heaven not to have to study for entrance exams.

124
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,040
Really - Look, look!

125
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,170
It's kind of a scary sight!

126
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,360
While we're having fun, everyone in Class A is frantic.

127
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,860
So strange.
- the national Center Test is coming up soon.

128
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,740
And only Naoki Irie has room to relax.

129
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,160
Unbelievable. He's reading a book that has nothing
to do with the exams.

130
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,020
Is his first choice the University of Tokyo?

131
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,340
It's not just the University of Tokyo.
I haven't decided if I want to go to any college.

132
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,030
Kotoko...

133
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,380
Kotoko!

134
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,730
Huh?

135
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,130
I'm not sure.

136
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,140
He would go if he got accepted.

137
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,940
What are you talking about?
Of course he would get accepted.

138
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,520
But you will be sad. You two will go
to different schools.

139
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,980
But it's for his future.

140
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,480
I will support him.
- I will support him

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,900
-Jinko, I don't think so.
- For real?

142
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,240
- Mrs. Irie, well ...
- Yes?

143
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,680
Can I borrow your sewing set?

144
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,790
Sure. Hold on a minute.

145
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,550
Yes.

146
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,540
Huh... it's curved.

147
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,450
Don't worry, take your time.

148
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,920
Okay.

149
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,330
- Is that charm for Naoki?

150
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,930
Thank you, Kotoko-chan.

151
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,960
The one who's caring about Naoki's entrance exams the most...

152
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,700
is Kotoko-Chan.

153
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,020
He didn't really mean that he's not going to college, right?

154
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,350
I don't think he doesn't want to go to a college.

155
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,410
It could be that his father has too many expectations.

156
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,780
He went to the University of Tokyo.

157
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,390
That's why he wants Naoki to go to the same school,

158
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:58,630
And eventually take over his company.

159
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,720
Perhaps, because of his expectations, ...

160
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,280
he is putting too much pressure on Naoki.

161
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,870
(Charm)

162
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,090
Day Before the National Center Test

163
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,480
Yes?

164
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,950
May I bother you for a minute?

165
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,840
Here.

166
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,370
Tomorrow is the National Center Test, so ...

167
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,770
You are taking it, aren't you?

168
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,460
I submitted the application.

169
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,400
Good.

170
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,860
Unless you have a school that you want to go to...

171
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,630
I think your parents would be very happy
if you went to the University of Tokyo.

172
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,620
I always give my father a hard time...

173
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,850
I wish I had opportunities like you
to make my father happy.

174
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,840
Well, that's it.

175
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,640
What are you...

176
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,020
planning to do in college?

177
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,000
What am I planning to do?

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,990
I will study and make friends...

179
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,550
You are going there to study...
which you don't enjoy doing.

180
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,180
I don't understand...

181
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,630
why is everyone desperate to go to college.

182
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,810
I know that colleges are supposed to be
for people like you to study.

183
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm not thinking . . .

184
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,270
of going to college.

185
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,540
I don't need someone to teach me in college.
I can learn by myself.

186
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,060
But to get qualifications for something you want to do in the future...

187
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,910
Well, then . . .

188
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,830
What do you want to do?

189
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,150
I don't know, but...

190
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,800
I know! You find out what you want to do
when you are in college.

191
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,160
What you want to do in the future.

192
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,280
You shouldn't use your smart brain just for yourself.

193
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,770
You need to utilize it for Japan's development.

194
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,540
You are amazing.

195
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,970
I've always thought...

196
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,120
"why does she put her whole self into things?"

197
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:06,300
And, "She puts her whole self into doing something... yet why can't she do it?"

198
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,150
I was impressed.

199
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,800
Are you being sarcastic?

200
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,730
I wish ...

201
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,730
... I could be like that.

202
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,630
I have to get up early tomorrow.
I'd better go sleep now.

203
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,390
Yes, good night.

204
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,250
I'm putting this on your bag.

205
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,190
Bag...

206
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,270
Perfect.

207
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,350
You can do it!

208
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,140
Naoki is late.

209
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,450
Don't tell me that he isn't going to take the test...

210
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,350
Don't worry. He knows how you feel about this.

211
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,200
But he can be stubborn sometimes...

212
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,760
What is it?

213
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,620
Good morning, Naoki.
What a pleasant morning!

214
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,990
Here... this is your lunch.

215
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,570
Thanks..

216
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,790
What's wrong, Naoki?

217
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,810
I feel a little hot.
I might have gotten a cold.

218
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,440
On an important day like this?

219
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,300
That's not good. We need some egg sake!

220
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,720
No, leeks work better for a sore throat!

221
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,140
Medicine, medicine, medicine.... !

222
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,900
That's okay. I'm going now.

223
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,940
- What about breakfast?
- I'm not hungry. This is enough.

224
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,880
What?

225
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,240
Naoki, Naoki, take this. This works well.

226
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,370
Now I'm relieved.

227
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,900
There's no way, but is this pill going to make me sleepy?

228
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,860
"Avoid driving a car after the use."

229
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,730
Throw, throw it up, Naoki!

230
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,140
Iri-chan, you put a finger in and I'll press!!

231
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,890
That's enough!

232
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,570
Bye.

233
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,380
Will he be okay?

234
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,100
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

235
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,490
Wait, is that lucky charm hand-made?

236
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,310
Possibly the girl you live with made it for you?

237
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,960
I'll throw it away when I get to the test site.

238
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,000
Don't... I feel pity for her.

239
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,220
I quite like her though.

240
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,150
What happened, Irie?

241
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,190
This thing...

242
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,030
The lucky charm must stuck at somewhere. Pull it out.

243
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,250
Hey, we don't have time for this.

244
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,930
Irie, hurry up!

245
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,940
Watanabe, you should go first.

246
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,800
But what about you...

247
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,180
I'll hurry and make it work anyway.

248
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,890
Sorry, I'll go first them. See you at the test site.

249
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,480
Okay.

250
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,800
Excuse me, the elevator has stopped.

252
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,850
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,370
The center test (Japanese SAT) for college applicants

254
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,570
Hey!

255
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,350
Good, you made it but took a long time.

256
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,630
The station employee was really upset at me.

257
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,820
Lately stopping elevator is getting popular as a prank.

258
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,820
I was accused if I'm the one who did this before.

259
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,210
We'll talk later. Let's get in.

260
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,180
Right, what did you do with the lucky charm?

261
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,890
Ah.

262
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,800
That really outlasts. Isn't that more like an "un"lucky charm?

263
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,430
Right?

264
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,630
I'll take it off.

265
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,810
It got off too easily.

266
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,880
Irie!

267
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:02,030
-People fell off from the stairs!
-Help! Anyone here?

268
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,830
Take them both to the health room right now!

269
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,310
How scary this charm is...

270
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,170
A lucky charm

271
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,290
I'm sorry, I'm late.

272
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,580
Aren't you the student who fell off from the stairs?
Hurry up. Only 30 minutes left.

273
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,460
Okay.

274
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,630
It happened at that time.

275
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,920
Thank you.

276
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,330
Hey, Irie.

277
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,070
I'm sorry to ask, but how was it?

278
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,800
I believe I answered most of the questions.

279
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,030
Well you'll make it anyway.

280
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,670
That girl...

281
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,020
What is it?

282
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,330
By any chance, the girl made the bento...?

283
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,040
It's better to not eat that. You'll be in trouble
if that makes your stomach upset.

284
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,180
If you'd like...

285
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,000
Thank you. You saved me.

286
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,260
Hey,

287
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,910
it's none of my business, but I think
you better throw the charm away.

288
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,820
When I woke up in the health room, It was gone already.

289
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,350
That's a relief. Now the misfortune passed.

290
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,620
10 minutes left.

291
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,600
You've gone through a lot, Irie.

292
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,650
But think that you're a normal person
who went through some misfortune accidents.

293
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,720
Saying that wouldn't comfort you, right?

294
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,200
Hey, you!

295
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,240
Today must be hard for you.

296
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,900
Thank you for taking care of me.

297
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,280
You didn't break your bone
but make sure to take some rest for a while.

298
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,200
Yes, thank you very much.

299
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,450
Oh, right! I think it's yours.

300
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,890
The charm left behind in the stair.

301
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,870
I put that in your pocket.

302
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,280
It's hand-made, and I thought
It must be a precious thing for you.

303
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,660
I hope that this charm will bring back your luck.

304
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,290
So envious ~

305
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,540
I feel like the girl and you are going to be
together for your lifetime.

306
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,900
Stop it.

307
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,280
It's passed time for Naoki to return. He's late, isn't he?

308
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,950
It's Naoki!

309
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,480
Naoki, what's up with you? What happened to you?

310
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,570
I tripped.

311
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,530
What? Even at that, you're really badly injured!

312
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,800
The lucky charm didn't work.

313
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,260
No, I worked VERY well.

314
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,820
What does that mean?

315
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,350
I had enough.

316
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,100
I'm going to sleep.

317
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,770
Naoki.

318
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,920
I didn't do good with the center test.

319
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,760
Me, either. Now my only hope is state University.

320
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,710
Irie is going to be fine. He's the top of the country genius.

321
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,510
But this time, it's hard to be assured of that...

322
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,990
Kotoko, Jinko!

323
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,710
Did you hear that Irie's got accepted to The University of Tokyo?

324
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,330
-It's a lie! Where did you hear that?
-The rumor's from the faculty room.

325
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,840
Among the students applied for University of Tokyo,
he has the top score of them.

326
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Of course he's a genius!

327
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,660
Wait, Kotoko, why are you crying?

328
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,090
No...

329
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,370
I'm just happy.

330
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,830
I'll go and say "Congratulation" to Irie-kun!

331
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,900
This is what youth is.

332
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,270
He was that hurt, still he made it.

333
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,720
The person I like is really cool.

334
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,660
By any chance,

335
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,510
the charm helped in some level...?

336
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,620
I could get into University of Tokyo because of your charm.

337
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,970
Thank you.

338
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,950
Ah, watch out!

339
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,490
A person from class A.

340
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,170
Wait, what's wrong?

341
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,000
Or is it the result of the center test...?

342
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,330
As expected, Irie didn't do well with the center test.

343
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,070
What are you talking about?

344
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,090
Irie-kun's fine. It seems like he could
get into University of Tokyo.

345
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,640
What?

346
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,790
That's great with that condition.

347
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,260
That condition?

348
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,130
It was truly a miserable day for him.

349
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,530
Even it was because of the charm...

350
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,720
The charm?

351
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,660
No.

352
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,560
Wa...wait. What are you talking about?

353
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,610
Please tell me what's about.

354
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:52,090
Stop it. I'll tell you, I will so...

355
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,250
I'm waiting for my first preference,
Waseda University's interview now.

357
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,160
Your death power seems really powerful.

358
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,330
"Death power"?

359
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,380
Now we can laugh about it, but

360
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,430
many things happened because of the power of your charm.

361
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,150
All the troubles

362
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,270
were caused by the charm.

363
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,750
I

364
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,220
caused Irie-kun so much trouble.

365
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,630
I wish

366
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,450
Irie-kun will pass the exams to enter the University of Tokyo.

367
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,500
So that Irie-kun's family's dream

368
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,420
will come true.

369
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,870
This is

370
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,380
going to happen.

371
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,370
I know it's too early...

372
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,870
But a day after the exam

373
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,000
on Valentine's Day, I will give it to him.

374
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,150
So the fateful day is here.

375
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,820
I'm going.

376
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,670
But... you all don't have to come and say goodbye.

377
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,710
But we're so worried.

378
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,790
- Do you want me to drive you ?
- I'm fine.

379
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,160
My leg is better now.

380
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,510
- I'm going.
- Please be careful.

381
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,340
Goodbye.

382
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,350
It was a disaster.
I've never seen Irie like that.

383
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,710
Even thought it was because of the charm...

384
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,730
Kotoko-chan.

385
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,880
I'm going to watch Irie-kun until he pass the gate to the University of Tokyo.

386
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,590
I'm so worried that something might happen.
I'm going.

387
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,180
Goodbye!

388
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,230
It's so obvious that you are following me.

389
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,420
I wanted to see you to the front of the University of Tokyo.

390
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,040
I slipped!

391
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,470
I'm sorry to slip in front you.

392
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,120
Why is there a banana ?

393
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,560
Ouch!

394
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,350
Wow!

395
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:55,280
Everyone looks smart.

396
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,640
Why are you walking weirdly?

397
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,150
Really? It's normal.

398
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,640
You look sick too.

399
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,750
I'm just nervous.

400
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,370
Why are you nervous?

401
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm the one who going take the exam.

402
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,520
What should I do ?

403
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,200
I've never had pain in my stomach like this.

404
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,160
But I can't.

405
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,840
Not while I haven't seen Irie-kun pass the door of the University.

406
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,430
I don't want

407
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,890
to make worry him.

408
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,610
Hey.

409
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,910
Are you really alright?

410
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,750
Of course! Good luck for your exam.

411
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,220
Goodbye!

412
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,400
Restroom...

413
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,240
What happened?

414
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Anyone! Is anyone here?

415
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,210
What happened?

416
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,530
She collapsed suddenly.

417
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,490
- Hang on!
- Excuse me!

418
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,070
Hey, are you okay?

419
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,380
Excuse me. The hospital.
Where is the hospital?

420
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,670
I think there is one that way.

421
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,350
Irie-kun...

422
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,060
Please go to the exam.

423
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,580
Irie-kun...

424
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,600
you are going to be late.

425
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,240
Please go the exam.

426
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,580
Ojisan (Naoki's father)

427
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,810
Obasan (Naoki's mother)

428
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,160
Yuki-kun...

429
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,820
They are all...

430
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,660
rooting for you.

431
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,990
Kotoko-chan. Kotoko-chan.

432
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,840
Otousan (father, dad).

433
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,490
Oba-sama (aunt).

434
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,460
Oji-sama (uncle).

435
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,780
Why

436
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,090
am I here?

437
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,110
Are you okay, Kotoko-chan?

438
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:54,970
You had acute appendicitis. But, you are fine now since they gave you some medicine.

439
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,280
You will be able to go home by the end of today.

440
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,110
I'm glad you are okay, Kotoko-chan.

441
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,750
What about Irie-kun?

442
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,670
When we got here, he was gone.

443
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,010
He must have gone to the university after he called us.

444
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,200
It must be in the middle of the exam at this time.

445
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,910
That's a relief.

446
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,040
If he couldn't take this exam because of me...

447
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,190
I was worried, what if his life was ruined ...

448
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:41,220
Kotoko-chan. You care about Naoki the most

449
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,490
when you are suffering like this.

450
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,120
Are you talking of me?

451
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,260
Naoki!
Are you supposed to be taking the exam?

452
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,020
I was hungry, so I went out to get some food.

453
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,840
Then what about the exam?
And the university?

454
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,690
University? I didn't take the exam.

455
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,390
No way...

456
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,080
No way...

457
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,090
Irie-chan, I'm really sorry.

458
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:28,320
- Ai-chan.
- Because my daughter, your son had difficulty...

459
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,470
Please raise your head.
It was Naoki

460
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,780
who decided not to take the exam.

461
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,460
And even if he got into the university...

462
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,360
I would have been disappointed
if he had left Kotoko-chan in pain.

463
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,150
That's right. That's right.
This was his fate.

464
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,900
Don't worry. Please raise your head.

465
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,470
Because of me...

466
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:01,430
the worst thing happened to the Irie family;

467
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,720
-To the Irie Family-

468
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,220
Dear Irie family,

469
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,750
I want to thank you for everything.

470
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,430
Goodbye, Irie-kun.

471
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:37,020
I don't want to give you trouble anymore.

472
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,010
I will

473
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,820
live somewhere you don't have

474
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,410
to see me.

475
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,570
Where should I go?

476
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,420
It's cold.

477
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,140
Then do you want to hold a can of coffee?

478
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,030
Irie-kun!

479
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,390
But why?

480
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,000
I couldn't sleep.

481
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,670
So I went out walking.

482
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,800
It's warm.

483
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,870
Please don't stop me!
I don't want to bother you anymore.

484
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,060
I'm not stopping you.

485
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,060
Then... goodbye.

486
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,800
Are you leaving because I didn't go to the university?

487
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,770
I think I bring you bad luck.

488
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,320
Not only at the University of Tokyo, but also at the National Center Test...

489
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,310
I heard that

490
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,150
from Watanabe-kun of Class A.

491
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,600
I might be

492
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:33,360
a terrible person for you.

493
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,550
You might be right.

494
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,000
Indeed, nothing good ever happened when you were around.

495
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,630
You always mess up my space.

496
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,370
People at school spread rumors about us.

497
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,200
You made me help you with studying.

498
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,690
And in the end, you ruined my entrance exam.

499
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,340
I'm horrible.

500
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,850
But...

501
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,670
It was kind of fun.

502
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,450
It was my first time being so nervous.

503
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,240
For the first time in my life,
I was scared to see the test result.

504
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,690
It was an incredible experience.

505
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,170
But what about the university?

506
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,940
It wasn't because of you that I didn't take the exam for the university.

507
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,550
Huh?

508
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:45,960
After I dropped you off at the hospital,
I had plenty of time to make it to the exam.

509
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,070
Then why?

510
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,360
You said that you go to college
to find out what you want to do.

511
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:02,760
It's been fun being with you getting nervous and excited.

512
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,540
I thought it wasn't a bad idea to go to Tonan University without taking an exam.

513
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,390
So...

514
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:15,700
I wondered what I would do if I went to the University of Tokyo.

515
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:23,210
You mean you chose the same school because of me?

516
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,720
I didn't say that.

517
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,590
But...

518
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,540
All right, just go.

519
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,680
Good luck!

520
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,500
Wait a minute!

521
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,140
Do you think... I can

522
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,690
stay at you house a little longer?

523
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,990
I won't cause you any more trouble.

524
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:55,330
Are you kidding me?
There is no way that you wouldn't cause me any trouble.

525
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,710
You are right.

526
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,590
Then... I promise that I will bring you an exciting life!

527
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,730
Changing your mind was quick.

528
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,040
Hey!

529
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,340
Today is Valentine's day.

530
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,150
So what?

531
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,160
Are you going to give me chocolate?

532
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,510
I'm sorry.

533
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,470
Were you expecting one?

534
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,070
Not really.

535
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,760
There is one.

536
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,840
Awful.

537
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,830
White Valentine's day...

538
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,220
This year, my feelings just went around in circles.

539
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,140
But I hope...

540
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,840
my feelings

541
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,850
will reach him some day.

542
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,750
First kiss.

543
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,300
A couple that kisses each other on graduation day.

544
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,180
Will stay together forever.

545
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,430
Let's make it the best graduation ceremony!

546
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,910
Kotoko, how about me?

547
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,610
I don't dislike you, Kin-chan.

548
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,490
I will kiss Kotoko tonight.

549
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:19,020
- You should have dream when you are sleeping.
- Kotoko will love me then?

550
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,350
She realized who cares about her the most.

551
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,250
You, cold-blooded man!
