00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,020
Fine, Aihara.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,990
Take this!

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,550
Kotoko!

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,560
Got it!

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,760
I see it now.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,460
You did it.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,430
ouch!

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,310
Did you hurt your ankle?

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,890
Does it hurt right here?

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,460
Oh, that hurts!

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,070
God, if I tell him that I love him even more...

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,160
would he be mad?

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,470
When are we going to reach your house?

14
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,800
Ohh, It's strange.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,570
Oh, That's it!
That is my new house!

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,980
Yes?

17
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,130
Who are you?
I live in this house.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,760
This is my house.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,920
No way!

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,260
Anyway,

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,150
This is my house and the place where I live.

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,500
What is this all about?

23
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,590
I'm sorry, Irie-kun.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,240
If I left you with your injured leg,
my mother is going to be mad at me again.

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,800
Anyway, I'll stay with you until you father come to get you.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,500
But... I don't know where did he go.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,630
Big Brother!
Bad news.

28
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,930
My room will again,

29
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,380
become hers.

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,680
All because of her.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,870
Welcome back, Naoki and Kotoko-chan.

32
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,650
I thought you two were together.

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,710
We both went to my new house,
but there was someone else in there.

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,930
I've been calling my father, but he didn't answer.

35
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,540
Your father went to the real estate agency.

36
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,170
Pardon?
What's going on?

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,480
Well, I think there is a mistaken in the contract.

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,460
Somebody else signed the contract for that new house,

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,930
a day before your father did.

40
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,450
What?

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,380
I really apologize.

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,820
Another client signed the contract just one step before you through a connected company.

43
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,760
But, that's...

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,390
You see, this large furniture were,

45
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,600
supposed to go to your new house today.

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,130
But the plan didn't work out well.

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,470
He was busy calling the moving company,

48
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,090
and the real estate agency.

49
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,960
That's why you couldn't reach him.

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,790
Does that mean we both once again lost a place to live?

51
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,220
What should we do?

52
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,640
Don't worry, you can come back to live with us again.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,770
You and Mr. Aihara can live in this house again!

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,570
After all, we're still going to be family in the future.

55
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,720
Isn't it?

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,560
You're saying all these nonsense again.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,530
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,800
I know you two kissed last time.

59
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,770
I did not tell her! I did not tell her! I did not tell her!

60
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,170
No way, that can't be true.

61
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,660
It's not true right, Big Brother?

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,340
I'd have never thought of that by just looking at you two.

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,030
You know that it's not nice to trick your parents like that.

64
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,820
How did you know about that, Mrs. Irie?

65

I'm really happy that you've returned
back to our house, Kotoko-chan.

74
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,870
Does it feel like you've return back to your own house?

75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,780
It's not like that, Mrs. Irie.

76
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,310
Irie-kun and I are not like what you think of us.

77
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,990
We're going to leave as soon as we found a new house.

78
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,320
But, I wonder if you could find yourself a new house or not.

What?

80
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,650
Anyway, I'm resolved to have you

81

marry into our family.

82
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,630
After all you and Naoki kissed before.

83

However, like I said before, it's not like you think.
It was just a mistake.

We've never been on a date either.

Don't let yourself down, Kotoko-chan.

Even if you haven't done it yet,

you can do it later in the future!

a date by accident.

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,720
W-what?

164
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,830
Don't come up with something like that without any knowledge.

165
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,530
But you told everyone that you're going to give up on Irie-kun.

166
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,190
It has created a little warning in the tennis club.
So the reason behind it was
Sudo-san, right?

167
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,530
Really? Is that true?

168
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,640
No, it's not true, no, no!
Irie-kun, this is a misunderstanding.
It's not what it's look like.

169
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,210
It doesn't even concern me.

170
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,210
Oh, Matsumoto.
About what you said earlier...

171
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,290
I'm free on Sunday, so I can go see a movie with you.

172
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,510
Really? Thank you!

173
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,290
This is all your fault, Sudo-san.
You leaned on me all of a sudden.

174
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,890
I forgot that you have injured leg.

175
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,520
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,900
I didn't know there was such a rumor,

177
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,260
about us in the tennis club.

178
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,870
There is no such rumor!

179
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,020
I'm sure that Matsumoto-san made it up!
She just wanted to give Irie-kun more impression about her.

180
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,520
Matsumoto isn't that type of girl,
who would lie because of a useless thing!

181
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,560
I see you

182
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,690
really love Matsumoto-san.

183
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,500
Aihara,

184
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,050
I want to discus with you about something.

185
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,820
How should I start with this?

186
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,390
You love Irie.

187
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,610
I love Matsumoto.

188
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,410
Matsumoto loves Irie.
There is no benefit.

189
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,640
Everyone will end up being depress!

190
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,600
That's why, we should start working together,

191
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
and help each other out.
What do you think?

192
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,540
Help? How?

193
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,540
For example.

194
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,680
What? Really?

195
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,410
What?

196
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,810
You will stalk Irie's date?

197
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,510
I don't want Kin-chan to hear it!

198
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,500
Don't worry.

199
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,870
I think Kin-chan is not working today.

200
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,850
Kotoko, what are you looking at?

201
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,940
It's a good thing.

202
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,620
But what will you get by stalking his date?

203
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,540
I don't know, but I'm worried,

204
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,560
if something happens between them.

205
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,450
Every time I think of it,

206
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,220
I just get so nervous.

207
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,760
You are so pathetic.
- Satomi!

208
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,540
But that's true!
She gives away her first date to Matsumoto Yuko,

209
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,130
and plus,
she will just stalk their date.

210
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,970
That'll just mean that Sudo-san and Kotoko
are really going out.

211
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,340
Did you hear that strange sound?

212
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,510
Jinko, we are talking about something really important here.

213
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,170
Just zip your mouth!

214
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,040
Do you want some apple tea?

215
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,190
Orange juice, please.

216
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,870
Sudo-san and Kotoko are going out on a date?

217
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,780
What's going on here?

218
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,670
So you are...fine with that?

219
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,990
I can't help it.
That's what love is.

220
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,690
Kotoko fell in love with someone else?

221
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,120
With that bearded old man?

222
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,240
It's a date,

223
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,050
The movie called...Ginza.

224
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,860
I see, it's Karasumori,

225
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,870
Shimbashi.

226
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,780
Ginza? Karasumori?

227
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,470
Shimbashi?

228
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,200
I don't care where it is.

229
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,490
Movie date...Romance...

230
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,550
Date...

231
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,400
Movie...

232
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,160
Ginza, Karasumori...

233
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,680
Shimbashi.

234
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,370
Romance...

235
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,450
Date, Movie,

236
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,790
Ginza, Karasumori, Shimbashi, Romance.

237
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,990
I can't understand anything about this.
I feel like dying.

238
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,800
What are you doing?
The restaurant will open soon!

239
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,220
- I'm sorry.
- What's that?

240
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,740
I don't get this!

241
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,600
Is it codes or something?
Date,

242
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,250
Movie, Ginza, Karasumori, Shimbashi, Romance.

243
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,190
It puzzles the brain, right?

244
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,790
Oh, I got this.

245
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,290
No way? You solved the secret?

246
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,200
Are you going out on a date?
- No.

247
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,760
Of course you not.

248
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,490
A kid like you can't have such an amorous date like this.

249
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,190
Am - - - am - - -

250
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,740
Amorous?!

251
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,510
Kotoko, I'm sorry.

252
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,760
From that day, I've gone to every single real estate agency.

253
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,670
For some reason, every time I found a nice place, someone else always is one step ahead.

254
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,280
Oh, I see.

255
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,680
We have no luck at all.

256
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,470
Well, since we can't find any place yet,

257
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,180
we have no choice but stay with the Irie family for a while.

258
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,270
Dad,

259
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,330
it's not your fault,
so don't feel bad and apologize, okay?

260
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,540
Yeah, I was even

261
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,720
full of confidence when we left this house.

262
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,420
I thought I was making you go through hard times, too.

263
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,840
I'm free on Sunday,

264
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,870
so I can go see a movie.

265
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,330
Really? Thank you!

266
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,690
I knew it already.

267
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,450
No, it's not like what you think.

268
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,910
Dad.

269
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,180
I...

270
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,360
seem to still love Irie-kun.

271
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,850
But Naoki-kun doesn't have...

272
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,630
It doesn't matter anymore.

273
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,050
Irie-kun might never love me.

274
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,540
Yet, I don't want to give up until the very end.

275
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,310
You always tell me that, right?

276
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,930
It's not good to give up in the middle.

277
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,990
After I left this house, I've realized it.

278
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,420
That this is the feeling I really,

279
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,760
don't want to give up right now.

280
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,660
I see.

281
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,140
So don't worry too much about me, Dad.

282
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,530
Even if I get hurt,

283
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,300
it's better than doing nothing then regret it later.

284
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,160
You really similar,

285
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,660
To mom?

286
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,130
No, to me.

287
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,470
Just as I thought,

288
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,210
you are my daughter.

289
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:45,080
[Sunday]

290
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,440
Not this one.

291
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,840
Flower pattern...

292
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,660
I don't want a flower pattern either.

293
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,160
White...

294
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,680
The white one is cute, too.

295
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,710
This one...

296
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,100
Yes, this is it!

297
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,320
Why am I wearing makeup?

298
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,130
I'm not the one who is going on a date with Irie-kun.

299
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,780
It's Matsumoto-san.

300
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,900
I wanted to go on a date with Irie-kun, too.

301
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,280
Getting all dolled up wearing something nice
and putting on some makeup.

302
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,440
Seeing a movie and going shopping...

303
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,580
And then have a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant.

304
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,690
Alright.

305
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,950
Oh, she's here.

306
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,020
Whoa!

307
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,170
Nice body.

308
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,840
Sudo-san, when did you get here?

309
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,350
Hey, is Irie quick with girls?

310
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,190
Well, I don't think so. He is rather slow...

311
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,760
That's because it was you.

312
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,530
If it's that sexy Matsumoto, I'm sure Irie will be...

313
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,200
Oh, Irie-kun.

314
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,210
Irie-kun!

315
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,150
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, I tried to get here early.

316
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,410
You look good in that dress.

317
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,900
Really? I'm glad.

318
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,390
That Irie... he is so pompous.

319
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,660
- Should we get going?
- Yes

320
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,820
Erotic...

321
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,790
Hey, Kinnosuke, this way, this way...

322
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,770
Kotoko!

323
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,290
May I have seats right behind those people?
-Yes

324
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,830
Hurry, hurry...

325
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,610
(A Widow Waiting in Vain)

326
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,090
Ta-da!

327
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,130
I'm absolutely right, ain't I? Movie, Shimbashi, Romance.

328
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,810
And a one minute walk from Karasumori exit.

329
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,820
But what about "Ginza"?

330
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,860
You should figure it out already!

331
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,480
After they get turned on from seeing a movie...

332
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,570
they are going to go to fancy hotel in Ginza and...

333
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,070
That bearded bastard!

334
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,680
How dare he show this to Kotoko...

335
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,250
and try to do something dirty!

336
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,330
Hey!

337
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,880
I'm sorry.

338
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,350
What are you doing? Over there!

339
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,440
What's this?

340
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,050
Oh no, I dropped my booklet.

341
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,830
Oh please, pay more attention, sweetheart.

342
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,730
You are right, dear.

343
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,910
Oh, me too.
- Dear, what are you doing? Did you put ketchup on it?

344
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,470
Oh, my back... hurts.

345
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,950
Hey, Kinnosuke... let's wait inside!

346
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:08,580
I let him kiss her... but I won't let anybody
go further than that!

347
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,580
Excuse me? What is this?

348
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,300
Hey, sit down, I can't see!

349
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,000
It was a good movie.

350
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,570
Would you like to have some tea?
- Yeah

351
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,650
Let's go.

352
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:15,120
You know, I was interested in you even
when I was in junior high.

353
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,310
Someone told me that there was
a very talented tennis player at Tonan.

354
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,390
Not only that, he was handsome and smart.

355
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,260
and your father graduated from Tokyo University and is the president of a company, right?

356
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,280
I was sure that you would take exams for other schools.

357
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,620
But when I heard that you were going to Tonan University...

358
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,390
I was so happy.

359
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,250
I thought it was fate.

360
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,110
I see.

361
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,740
What type of girls do you like, Irie-kun?

362
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,330
- Type?

363
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,570
- Well...

364
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,500
Beautiful ...

365
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,550
Has a nice body...

366
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,530
And I like a smart girl.

367
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:09,080
Ah, and she definitely has to be good at cooking.

368
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,400
Aihara...

369
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,170
I'm sure there is something good in you.

370
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:27,830
It's okay. You don't need to try so
hard to encourage me.

371
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,420
I see.

372
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:36,280
It sounds like we would make a
great couple, don't you think?

373
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,470
Maybe

374
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,260
We still have some time until dinner.
Would you mind going shopping with me?

375
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,000
Sure.

376
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,730
Which one do you think is the best?

377
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,590
I think you'll look great in this one.

378
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,050
Really?

379
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,610
- Excuse me?
- Yes

380
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,460
- May I try this one?
- Yes, Thank you so much.

381
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,960
Come right this way.

382
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,610
Why is Irie-kun looking at an accessory like that?

383
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,420
It can't be that he's thinking of
giving it to Matsumoto-san as present?

384
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,650
That can't be! We've lived together for so long
and I have never received anything.

385
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,370
Irie-kun, can you close the back please?

386
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,910
Thank you. How is it?

387
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,660
Sudou-san!

388
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,700
Wait for a moment.

389
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,730
- What is doing? What is he doing?
- Scary, scary.

390
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,880
No, don't touch her.

391
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,080
He's touching her!

392
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,320
Nooooo!

393
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,030
How is it?

394
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,200
As expected, Irie-kun.

395
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,330
Your sense is good. It works with these clothes.

396
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,610
It's because the person who wear it looks good in it.

397
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,690
Still, I'm happy about your sense.

398
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,400
The whole world is shaking.

399
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,110
But, those two fit well together, right?

400
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,280
What are we going to do if even you admit it?

401
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,160
I'll carry it.

402
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,480
Thank you.

403
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,030
Alright, let's go.

404
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,080
I always wanted to have it.

405
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,820
- Now there are shoes I like, in white-
- It's dangerous!

406
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,940
Are you ok?

407
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,100
Thank you.

408
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,610
I'm happy you didn't get hurt.

409
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,270
Let's go.

410
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,060
Senpai,

411
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,890
I'm going home.

412
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,930
Why are saying, Aihara?

413
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,540
I can't endure to see anything more.

414
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,800
But we both came here to stop them from doing things that we don't want to see.

415
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,630
But, I think it can't be helped if they like each other.

416
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,600
This is too distressing.

417
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,100
Sorry Sudo-senpai, I'm going home.

418
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,390
Ok, go home safely.

419
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,460
Wah!

420
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,070
I am sorry.

421
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,710
What are you going pay for this?

422
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,950
Sorry!

423
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,690
Sorry! It's gonna need cleaning, right?

424
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,870
You think that's enough?!

425
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,640
This shirt is expensive!

426
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,120
US $1000!

427
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,740
$1000?!

428
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,000
- Sudo-senpai, what can we do?
- Oh, we have to do something.

429
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,620
Uhm, here are $200.

430
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,330
Miss, you have a cute face.

431
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,690
How about you come to our office for a moment,
to get advice on several topics?

432
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,570
Ok, let's go.

433
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,160
No! Please stop!

434
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,470
That's my punishment.
The punishment for disturbing people's date...

435
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,810
$15 in total should be more than enough.

436
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,570
Why are you there?

437
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,370
You, kid, what did you say right now?

438
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:48,410
The cleaning fee of a cheap shirt,
$15 in total should be generous at that.

439
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,690
You fucking bastard!

440
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,360
So choice!!

441
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Sorry, just a moment. Sudo-san?

442
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,180
I'll leave the rest up to you.
You've been hiding from us the whole day,

443
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,700
Now quickly show your good points,
and take back Matsumoto please.

444
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,780
- Irie-kun.
- Sorry, that's it for today.

445
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,860
- Wait!
- Wait is what I should say!

446
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,310
This is useless!

447
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,030
I am...

448
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,980
running together with Irie-kun.

449
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,320
Like a dream.

450
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,940
If would be alright if time would stop like this.

451
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,690
It should be alright if we stopped here.

452
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,480
Irie-kun.

453
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,190
Maybe, you noticed that we followed you?

454
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:43,610
Your dumb secret monitoring,
I noticed it already at the meeting place.

455
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,190
Then, what about Sudo-senpai liking Matsumoto-san?

456
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,270
Until yesterday I thought that
you and Sudo-senpai really are together.

457
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,990
But I understood when you were secretly following us.

458
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,820
Thinking of this, you were acting really strange.

459
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,070
I am sorry.

460
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,820
I heard that you are going to date Matsumoto-san,

461
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,070
and couldn't endure it, and then...

462
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,400
But, if you like Matsumoto-san,

463
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,620
I've done an unforgivable thing and interrupted...

464
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,970
Should we go somewhere?

465
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,810
Huh?

466
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,990
Ok.

467
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,820
Then I'll go home.

468
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,490
Let's go.

469
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,580
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

470
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,240
I understand it if you only say it once.

471
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,160
Where shall we go?

472
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,740
Then, cinema.

473
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,900
Oh, you've been there already.

474
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:12,250
Then shopping,
and dining in a fancy restaurant after that.

475
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,780
In that outfit?

476
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,730
That's right.

477
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,060
Irie-kun, you're right, this outfit is embarrassing.

478
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,440
Come.

479
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,980
Totally beautiful!
Hey, Irie-kun, it's beautiful right?

480
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,030
Huh?

481
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,160
Irie-kun?

482
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,150
Irie-kun? Where are you?

483
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,150
Irie-kun?

484
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,100
Irie-kun?

485
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,320
Have I been made fun of by Irie-kun again?

486
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,240
With that outfit going to a restaurant is impossible, right?
Here, your meal.

487
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,790
Tasty.

488
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,120
When you are hungry, everything is tasty.

489
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,870
No.

490
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:02,490
Any food from French, or Italian or Chinese restaurant,

491
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,570
It can't compare to this hamburger!

492
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,190
As for me, I didn't have any kind of difficulty until recently.

493
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,740
But ever since you gave me that love letter, when we were in high school senior year,

494
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,280
almost every single day,
there is some big deal and irritation for me.

495
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,270
I thought, probably you are a test assigned to me.

496
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,400
A test?

497
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,820
The first test ever that I couldn't tackle,

498
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,010
that's why I tried my best to escape.

499
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,910
What?! As if a person is a goddess of ill-fate.

500
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,940
But,

501
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,070
I came to think that rather than a life without hardship,
tackling your partner like a test might be interesting.

502
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,400
Thank you.

503
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,940
Huh?

504
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,320
It's okay if you don't understand.

505
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,040
I understand that much,
don't make me into a fool.

506
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,820
In other words, you thought of escaping from me,
but then though it over again...

507
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,480
Ohh!

508
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,430
You want to get married? Oh, Pro-

509
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,810
Proposal?

510
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,430
Idiot! Why are you suddenly progressing that far?

511
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,810
Right.

512
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,190
I am saying,

513
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,700
I'm not opposed to us living in the same house.

514
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,820
That means,

515
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,450
you don't

516
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,450
hate me?

517
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,820
You are difficult for me,

518
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,530
but I don't hate you.

519
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,820
Not only your clothes,
your face will become a mess too.

520
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,830
But...

521
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,450
Wow, I'm so energize.

522
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,530
It's silly for me to watch three movies in a row.

523
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,200
Oh, Kinnosuke. You're still here?

524
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:43,650
Kotoko, where are you?

525
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,780
Kinnosuke?

526
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,980
Kinnosuke?

527
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,190
What a mess.

528
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,410
Surprisingly, Irie-kun and I went to our first date.

529
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:19,910
It was so different from what I thought.

530
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,320
But, more than our first time kissed,

531
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,540
more than his first time carried me,

532
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,750
I'm starting to feel

533
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,740
like Irie-kun is more much closer to me, now.

534
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,690
No, I disagree with this.

535
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,070
At last Kotoko-chan return back home, and now Naoki is going to leave?

536
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,310
Well,

537
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:15,690
as a man, he needs more experience.

538
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:21,280
If that is what he wants to do, then it might be a good idea
for him to explore life on his own.

539
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,480
Give it a try.

540
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,820
Thank you very much.

541
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:42,070
Irie-kun will leave this house, and go live by himself?

542
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:47,900
He told me last time that he didn't have any problem living with me.

543
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,150
But, why?

544
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,030
What's going on here?

545
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,840
♫ My overgrown bangs are ♫

546
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,760
♫ gently shaken by the wind ♫

547
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,320
♫ It's still slightly chilly ♫

548
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,210
♫ on the way home in the evening ♫

549
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:20,220
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness ♫

550
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:25,600
♫  that blossomed in my heart ♫

551
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,680
♫ I realized many things ♫

552
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:34,200
♫ when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

553
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,260
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

554
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,310
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

555
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:46,520
♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

556
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:53,040
♫ your smile, and today ♫

557
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,090
♫ Many tears were shed ♫

558
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:01,460
♫ and there were many arguments ♫

559
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:05,490
♫ Above all, there's the irreplaceable time, ♫

560
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,940
♫ your smile, and surely tomorrow as well ♫

561
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,850
♫ Your memories and your future ♫

562
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,100
♫ Hold onto them tightly, so they won't be ruined ♫

563
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:22,260
♫ More than anyone else, ♫

564
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:30,210
♫  I always want to walk by your side ♫

565
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,330
Irie-kin is going to move out.

566
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,390
We returned only to have him leave home.

567
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,870
I've found where he is, now!

568
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:41,160
Will you go to spy on Naoki's workplace with me?

569
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,580
I'll work in this restaurant!

570
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,610
Then I will be always next to Irie-kun!

571
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,310
I've kept you waiting.

572
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:50,660
Matsumoto-san, how did you know that Irie-kin works here?

573
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,900
He told me that.

574
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,640
I always stay next to you.

575
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,020
I'm also here for you.

576
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:01,150
I feel like the distance between Irie-kin and I keep going further.
