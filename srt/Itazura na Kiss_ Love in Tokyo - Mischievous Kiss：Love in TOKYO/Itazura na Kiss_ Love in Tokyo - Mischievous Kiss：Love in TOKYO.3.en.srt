1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,290
I'm Aihara Kotoko, from class F.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,950
Would you read this?

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,850
I don't need it.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,150
Refusing Kotoko, I won't allow that!

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,950
This is a declaration of war to me!

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,450
It is said that when you move,
your fate changes as well!

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,950
There will be something good for sure.

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,680
A shooting star.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,430
It has been hit... by a shooting star?

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,850
Because of such a thing

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,640
I have moved to the house of my father's good friend.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,120
I'm Aihara Kotoko.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,840
But this house...

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,020
What's up with you Kotoko?

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,220
My greeting is late.

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,350
This house is actually the home of

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,430
the boy I adore, Irie Naoki-kun.

18
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,450
Don't tell anyone that we are living together.

19
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,660
In school as well, don't ever talk to me.

20
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,070
You didn't have to say that much...

21
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,490
I hate dumb women.

22
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,880
I'll defeat Irie Naoki-kun at the exam next week.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,150
- Surprise!
- Give it back!

24
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,490
For the one week until the exam,
please teach me!

25
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,350
Maybe Kotoko is

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,950
even more amazing than I imagined!

27
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,270
No way, 100th!

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,500
Her new house somehow

29
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,210
seems like it has a secret.

30
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,900
WHAT?!

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,520
No, this photo...

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,740
The place where you are living right now,

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,640
it is Irie Naoki's house?

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,740
Aihara.

35
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,630
- What?
- Come with me.

36
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,070
That Irie and I live together

37
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,030
turned into a school rumour.

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,140
What do your friends think?!

39
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,730
Because you even wrote a love letter to me,

40
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,650
it must be okay for you to have such a rumour,

41
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,840
but it's a nuisance to me.

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,200
Don't get into my way from now on.

43
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,500
I...

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,490
why am I crying?

45
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,700
The Irie-kun that should have turned me down a long time ago,

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,200
asks me about this bullying,

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,350
and even blames me.

48
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,450
I wonder why my tears come?

49
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,450
I...

50
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,200
really seem to like Irie-kun.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,180
Kotoko-chan, aren't you late?

52
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,030
I was worried.

53
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,180
Sorry, I forgot to call.

54
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,510
Sorry.

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,390
The first love letter I wrote in my life,

56
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,150
the love letter that, in the end, didn't get read,

57
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,500
I don't need it.

58
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,450
Even though I know what kind of suckky guy he is,

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,840
I still like him after all.

60
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,200
Hey, the bathroom is open.

61
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm coming in.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,490
Mom said to take a bath.

63
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,740
Dear Irie,

64
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,450
I am Aihara Kotoko from class F.

65
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,800
You probably don't know me,

66
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,400
but I know you.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
Since you made the welcoming speech two years ago,

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,200
I admired your intelligence and diversity.

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,070
Ever since I first saw you at that time,

70
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,710
I felt like I had been hit by a shooting star,

71
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,610
a special feeling had been born inside me.

72
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,950
I like you.

73
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,390
♫ Hey, do you notice?
I'm updating. ♫

74
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,530
♫ One day I'll reach you ♫

75

♫ Where is the real feeling? ♫

76
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:39,100
♫ Avoiding and not being liked is somehow boring, isn't it? ♫

77
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,140
♫ Like this, thinking the same thing over and over again... ♫

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,700
♫ Let's share it by half! ♫

Mischievous Kiss: Love in TOKYO

92
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,240
#03
The Morning Coffee Smells Like Love?!

93
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,140
Oh no.

94
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,980
Good morning!

95
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,150
Good morning!

96
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,890
So you overslept, like always, Kotoko.

97
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,510
How about you get up earlier and help the Mrs.?

98
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,300
Sorry.

99
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,540
It's okay.

100
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,430
Big brother and Yuki don't do anything either.

101
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,900
Hey, sit down here.

102
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,200
Yes.

103
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,070
I'm going to eat.

104
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,240
Hey Kotoko,

105
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Can you get something for me on your way back from school?

106
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Yes, what is it?

107
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,450
Well, we are receiving so much support from everyone here,

108
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,360
I thought I'll cook today's dinner.

109
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
And you can help me as well.

110
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,150
I see, today your store is closed.

111
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,510
Don't worry, Aihara-san.

112
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,140
No no, it's a pleasure for me.

113
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,190
Ai-chan's food is really delicious!

114
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,900
It's fun right, Naoki, Yuki?

115
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,180
Yeah, right.

116
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,910
Thanks for the food, I'll be going.

117
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,150
Bye.

118
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,700
Hey, Kotoko-chan, you as well.

119
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,530
Ah, yes.

120
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,430
What?

121
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,290
Ah, it was stuck there.

122
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,530
What... was that right now?

123
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,890
Tonan High School

124
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,650
Be careful. The stairs.

125
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,450
We're going down.

126
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,530
Kin-chan, it's difficult to walk.

127
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,330
Actually, it's annoying.

128
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,660
Kotoko, hold it in.

129
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,460
I have to protect you not only at home, but also at school.

130
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,180
Oh, Irie!

131
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,180
I told you it's okay.

132
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm really being hated.

133
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,570
And he even told me I shouldn't talk to him in school.

134
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,720
This way.

135
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,860
Understood.

136
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,490
What?

137
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,220
Isn't that the girl who lives at your house?

138
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,260
What are they doing?

139
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,570
As if I'd know...

140
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,670
You want to go to the Irie home to spy on them?
Do you really need to go that far Kin-chan?

141
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,750
But aren't you curious about them.

142
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,500
Yes we are.
That house!

143
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,630
It's huge.

144
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,570
Tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe......

145
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,490
Tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe....

146
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,020
If Irie finds out about this, he will be furious.

147
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,790
Shhh, there they are.

148
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,410
Hey Kotoko!
yes.

149
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,880
I can't see anything.

150
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,950
The cap.
The lens cap.

151
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,080
Wow they look so delicious.

152
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,640
Sure enough, Ai-chan, you are a pro!

153
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,420
What is this?

154
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,090
It's deep fried tofu in sauce that I made.

155
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,060
It looks bad but it's very tasty.

156
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,560
I don't want to eat it.
I don't want to eat it either.

157
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,530
Naoki, Yuki don't say that.

158
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,690
She's right.
Just sit down.

159
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,140
Let's start eating.

160
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,730
Damn them the food that , Kotoko made.

161
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,530
Shh, Kin-chan they'll hear you.

162
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,150
You too.

163
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,350
I will have some of the food Kotoko-chan made.

164
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,540
If I eat some, you two are going
to have some too, ok?

165
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,750
Ugh, awful...

166
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,000
As I expected...

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,190
No it's good.
Tasty.

168
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,400
You don't have to be nice, Iri-chan.
She has always been a terrible cook.

169
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,700
I can't believe she's my daughter.

170
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,820
If she stays like this, she won't be able to
find a family that she can marry into.

171
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,560
I'm sorry.
-You don't need to worry.

172
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,180
Kotoko-chan will marry into our family.

173
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,100
Wh-what did she just say?

174
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,380
What I'm saying is that
Naoki will marry Kotoko-chan.

175
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,160
I object.
No! I object.

176
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,800
He's right.
Please don't decide that without asking us!

177
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,620
Stop playing with our lives!
-Oh, really?!

178
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,820
I think Kotoko is definitely your type, Naoki.

179
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,590
What? Is that true?
-No way that's not true.

180
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,810
I don't want you.

181
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,090
Sorry to say, I don't want you either!

182
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,610
Well said Kotoko!

183
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Is that so? But you send me
some passionate love messages.

184
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,030
"Nice to meet you Irie-kun".
"My name is Aihara Kotoko .
I'm from class F".

185
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,840
'You don't know me but i know you.
'Since you made a speech
at the ceremony two years ago."

186
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,620
"I have been admiring your
intelligence and handsome face'.

187
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,150
What did you do that for?

188
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,710
Terrible! You read my letter.
-It was written to me.

189
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,670
But don't memorize all the words.
-I can't help it, if I read it once, I remember everything.

190
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,080
But you didn't have to recite
it in front of everyone.
-Hold on, hold on! What does that mean?

191
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,650
Could it be that Kotoko-chan has
liked Naoki for a long time?

192
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,650
Hey.

193
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,510
Tell everyone the truth.

194
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,750
I wrote a love letter.

195
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,530
Really, Kotoko?

196
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,710
Then, my plan...

197
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,430
is not a dream?

198
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,780
But that is in the past,
it was last year.

199
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,110
That's why now...
-Don't say such a thing.

200
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,070
You can fall in love with him again.
Right, Dad?

201
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,850
Uh, well, if you two are alright with that.

202
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,830
Wait a moment! Open!

203
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,920
Who are these kids?

204
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,620
- Kin-chan?
- Kotoko, open it!

205
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,120
These kids are my classmates.

206
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,000
What are you doing here?

207
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,620
I'm sorry, Kin-chan was really worried about you so...

208
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,940
No matter how much of a genius Naoki is, is he a man?!

209
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,880
He can turn into the wild beast anytime.
See, I was right about coming here!

210
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I heard him saying whatever he wanted.

211
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,720
Who are you?

212
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,440
To everyone in the Irie house, we meet for the first time.
(talking extremely polite)

213
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,720
My name is Ikezawa Kinnosuke.
(talking extremely polite)

214
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,150
I am Kotoko's classmate.

215
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,610
That means you're an idiot.

216
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,860
Hey, Yuki.

217
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,100
Kotoko and I are known in our class for our honest to goodness relationship.

218
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,420
Hey, Kin-chan, don't say something so irresponsible!

219
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,830
Kotoko-chan, you are so popular!

220
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,160
Yes, that's so.
-I'm very sorry.

221
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,820
So please don't try to do anything to her, okay?

222
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,610
Hey, Irie-kun, don't even talk about marriage!

223
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,960
I don't know such a thing.

224
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,200
What? What does this mean?

225
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,450
You never know about people's feelings.
I might hate her today,

226
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,990
but might fall in love with her tomorrow.

227
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,750
What? So you are really changing to Kotoko?

228
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,940
Well.

229
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,850
But don't forget that rather than you,
I am on her mind.

230
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,150
I'll go upstairs then.

231
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,230
What was that right now? What is that supposed to mean?

232
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,260
Could this mean that...

233
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,000
it's okay for me to have hope?

234
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,450
In between all this, our last summer break began.

235
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,780
But somehow, because it's our last summer holiday in school

236
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,150
I want to make some wonderful memories.

237
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,650
However, we're preparing to take our (entrance) exams.

238
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,560
But still!

239
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,590
This being our final high school summer, we do want to make some memories, right?

240
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,330
But you are lucky, you can be with Naoki the whole summer.

241
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,380
Nothing's going to happen.
-ha, you never know!!

242
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,710
The other day he told you how he felt about you.

243
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,040
He said it because he wanted to beat Kin.

244
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,270
Well, Irie hasn't eaten Kotoko's homemade food.

245
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,260
Because I'm bad at cooking.

246
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,390
That's not the problem.

247
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,790
Men want to eat the homemade food of the woman they are interested in.

248
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,300
No matter what taste.

249
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,010
That's right. You are living together, so it's easy to cook for him.

250
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,930
This summer, with at least that thought in mind,
cook him something.

251
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,300
Homemade food?

252
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,040
No matter what you say, I can't stop worrying.

253
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,230
But I can't spy on them every day.
During the break, that damn Irie will be with Kotoko.

254
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,030
It's true. Girl's affection grows on the guy...

255
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,040
who are close by.

256
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,110
Don't say that.

257
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,520
Aniki (brother), don't give up.

258
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,690
You have to stay close by Kotoko
as much as Irie stays with her.

259
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,410
Good morning

260
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,780
Good morning.

261
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,350
Kotoko, the summer holidays begin today, right?

262
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,750
Well... I...

263
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,850
I have to go to school...

264
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,580
But, why? It's summer holidays.

265
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:41,150
Well... it's because...

266
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,250
Yuki, can you open the door?

267
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,450
Yes?

268
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,570
Irie family...

269
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,650
Good morning.

270
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:00,250
I, Kin, am here to pick up Kotoko to attend extra classes.

271
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,450
Extra classes?

272
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,050
But you were 100th on the last test.

273
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,750
I was 100th on finals,

274
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,750
but I did poorly on the midterm.

275
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,780
How bad was it?

276
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,950
You are definitely stupid.

277
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,650
Hey!

278
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,250
I'm leaving...

279
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,050
Everyone is from Class F

280
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,350
This is exacly the same as the regular class.

281
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,180
All of you...

282
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,270
are on the verge of not even making it

283
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,150
to our own university.

284
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,450
Even Aihara, who was the 100th on the finals, is no exception.

285
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,030
That is why

286
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,450
I want you to take these extra classes seriously.

287
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,490
Tonan High School, the hell of the summer classes

288
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,750
is about to start.

289
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:17,350
Summer is the most important time.

290
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,950
I don't think I can expect any good memories this summer.

291
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,850
Just what Kotoko said earlier.

292
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,450
Isn't it great?

293
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,950
You can spend this summer with me.

294
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,940
That's the best memory, isn't it? Good ahead and eat.

295
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,850
Can't you tell, Kin?

296
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,250
You are not the one Kotoko want to spend time with.

297
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,350
But I guess it's impossible since she's in the extra classes.

298
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,460
Oh!

299
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,150
But I think I saw Irie before.

300
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,050
Stupid, don't tell her that.

301
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,050
Don't tell me that Irie...

302
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,120
Irie is taking the extra classes!

303
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,450
Of course not!

304
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,850
Look at the school yard.

305
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,050
That's right.

306
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,550
he is kind of a member of the tennis club.

307
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,450
What do yo mean "kind of"?

308
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,850
He is not an official member of the tennis club.

309
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,050
But he is better than the members, so he plays when there is a tournament.

310
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,190
Right!

311
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,050
There is a high school national tennis tournament at the end of the month.

312
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,550
What?

313
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,560
I thought he was a nerd

314
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,050
with no motor skill.

315
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,000
He is perfect except for his personality.

316
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,750
He's so not likable.

317
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,250
But he didn't tell me that he was coming to school to play tennis.

318
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,650
As usual, he couldn't care less about you.

319
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,350
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay, right?

320
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,540
People change their minds.

321
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,170
You hate someone today, but...

322
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,250
Tomorrow, you might like that person.

323
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,230
Are you admiring him?

324
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,450
Huh?

325
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,550
No, I'm not.

326
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,440
It's not fair to win without working out

327
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,630
without jogging

328
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,850
and practicing every day.

329
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,080
I've got to study!

330
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,950
Let's do it!

331
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,180
Mars, the red planet, has fascinated people.

332
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,380
From the time of Aristotle

333
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,300
Asian people identified it with the god of war.

334
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,450
Ah...

335
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,050
He is cute, after all ...

336
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:59,020
I bet he's so tired after tennis practice.

337
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,720
When he gets home, it'll be fine if he has food made by my own hands ...

338
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,360
and get better!

339
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,650
Just wishing!

340
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,550
Aihara!

341
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,850
Kotoko Aihara!

342
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,950
Yes!

343
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,150
Read the rest of the paragraph.

344
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,050
Yes?

345
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,350
Page 63.

346
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,720
You were slacking. Run ten laps as punishment!

347
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,050
Eh?!

348
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,850
Ten laps?

349
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,850
You are slowing down!

350
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,450
Aihara, one more lap!

351
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,360
ouchie ...

352
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,630
Sorry.

353
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,650
I didn't do it on purpose.

354
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,250
Isn't the class over?

355
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,520
Leave me alone!

356
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,110
I just felt like running!

357
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,740
Hey, Aihara!

358
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,420
Stop that marital quarrel!

359
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,850
Here.

360
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,070
Kotoko, did you get tanned?

361
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,850
DId you also have an extra class for gym?

362
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,150
Um, this was...

363
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:06,150
She was slacking in class, so she had to run the school track as punishment.

364
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,850
How do you know that?

365
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,250
Set a thief to catch a thief!

366
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,050
Set what?

367
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,080
You don't even know that?

368
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,550
Are you stupid?

369
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,950
Yuki, that's enough!

370
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,820
Well, it's summertime.

371
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,950
It's okay to get tanned, right?

372
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,840
Really.

373
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,250
We usually go to the mountains or beach during the summer.

374
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,660
I'm so bored this year.

375
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,770
Huh?

376
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,920
You dind't hear from Ai-chan?

377
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,450
There is a class reunion

378
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,230
for our junior high.

379
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,350
So we are going back to Kyushu.

380
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,650
I didn't know that.

381
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,550
That's why we can't have a family trip this summer.

382
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,050
You should go with him.

383
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:58,050
I can't leave you children alone.

384
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,350
Sorry.

385
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,520
Thank you for the dinner.

386
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,450
Thank you.

387
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,450
Mrs. Irie, I would like to help you.

388
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,900
Thank you, Kotoko.

389
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,350
Then, can you clean the dishes? - Sure

390
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:29,350
I will prepare for tomorrow's lunch for you and Naoki.

391
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,550
Thank you always.

392
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,950
You leave so early in the morning. So it's easier if I prepare for it at night.

393
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,950
Well, Mrs. Irie... -Yes?

394
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,450
Do you think you can teach me how to cook?

395
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:55,050
Sure, but your father is a professional chef.

396
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,750
You are right.

397
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,640
But I want to learn how to cook homey food or

398
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,450
maybe, food with a mother's touch.

399
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,250
You want to learn "Irie family's cooking"?

400
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:17,050
Kotoko, you still like Naoki, don't you?

401
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,860
Why do you think that?

402
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,250
I can tell by looking at you.

403
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,950
You should marry into our family.

404
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,550
I'm not good enough for him.

405
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,550
Well, I ...

406
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,010
when I married my husband...

407
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,250
I was 19.

408
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,540
There were many people

409
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,050
who proposed to me.

410
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,530
They were all handsome, rich and young.

411
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,300
But you know how my husband looks.

412
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,550
And he was much older than me.

413
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,650
Plus, he just started his business, so he didn't have money either.

414
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,650
My parents objected to our relationship.

415
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,080
But you chose Mr. Irie...

416
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,150
Why did you do that?

417
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,530
He was honest,

418
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,790
hardworking,

419
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,150
and he really cared about me.

420
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,650
It wasn't my lineage, money or young age...

421
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:35,350
It was I whom he loved.

422
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,450
You remind me of my husband

423
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,050
back in those days.

424
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,290
A few weeks later

425
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,960
Congratulations!

426
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,680
To celebrate Naoki's first place

427
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,960
in the tennis competitions...
Cheers!

428
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,380
Cheers!

429
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,380
Please sit down! Sit down!

430
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,650
Let's eat.

431
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,520
Naoki,

432
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,160
is amazing.

433
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,880
You are not only smart, but can play tennis well.

434
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,370
And won three years consecutively!

435
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,350
Well..yes.

436
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,810
You don't even need to practice.

437
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,510
I'm amazed.

438
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,140
It's simple.

439
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,250
I learn the opponent's habit [pattern] as soon as possible.

440
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,550
Then, I can calculate where the ball will go.

441
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,570
Naoki isn't cute at all, is he?
[too straight forward]

442
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,790
He is also very smart.

443
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,440
He doesn't look like his dad at all, but he has your brains!

444
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,440
I wasn't as smart as he is.

445
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,450
Remember, how I was in junior high?

446
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,340
Is that so?

447
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,520
It really brings back good memories.

448
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,220
I am excited,

449
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,340
about tomorrow's reunion.

450
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,590
It's been a long time since we've been back to Kyushu.

451
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,750
Everyone will probably be late.

452
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,860
Yeah, well, I wonder if they'll be late.

453
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,990
Last day of Summer Vacation

454
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,820
We're off!

455
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,030
Bye!

456
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,250
The outfit looks good on you.

457
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,480
You make me embarrassed.

458
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,390
Travel safely!

459
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,330
See ya!!

460
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,080
Those two looked like grade school kids off on an excursion.

461
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,670
My dad's been very busy running his shop that this outing is a novelty for him

462
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,800
that I'm sure he was really looking forward to this.

463
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,270
Hello, this is the Irie residence.

464
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,720
Huh?! Is that the truth?!

465
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,570
Yes, I'll be there shortly.

466
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,900
What should I do?!

467
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,960
It's really bad!!

468
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,930
What happened??

469
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,720
Grandmother seems to have had an accident!

470
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,920
It doesn't seem to be too terrible, but it looks like she has to be hospitalized for tonight.

471
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,950
It looks like I have to be there as her support.

472
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,280
Please, go ahead and do that.

473
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,970
Thank you, Kotoko-chan.

474
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,410
Well, then, I'll leave the care of the house

475
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,360
to you two.

476
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,650
Yes.

477
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,480
WHAT?? The two of us?!

478
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,890
I'll be bringing Yuki along.

479
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,050
You two have school tomorrow morning, too.

480
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,450
I got it.

481
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,590
Let's hurry and get ready.
- Okay.

482
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,870
So it means...

483
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:34,450
only both of us are going to be in this house?

484
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,780
I'm really nervous, but

485
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,200
I think I could...

486
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,350
Yuki, let's get going.

487
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,250
Okay.

488
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:01,060
This is a good opportunity to impress Irie-kun with my cooking.

489
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,690
GREAT OPPORTUNITY!

490
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm going to create the best memory for this summer.

491
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,110
Bifteck en . . .

492
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:22,470
bour? Bours, Bourgeoise, Bourgeoise.

493
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,000
This is it.

494
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,770
What's that?

495
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:18,410
Bifteck en Bourgeoise.

496
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,410
Don't you need to look at the recipe?

497
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,160
I already looked at it.

498
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
Once I looked at it, I'll remember it.

499
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,650
How about Grandmother?

500
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,640
Don't we need to help her out?

501
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,270
There is a reason behind this, Yuki.

502
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,180
They're really slow.

503
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,020
I just wanted them both to be closer to each other.

504
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,440
Since the Fathers went out on the field trip,

505
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,670
so I thought I should let them be together by themselves.

506
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,160
How about Grandma's injury?

507
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,820
It's fake, I made it up.

508
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,950
It's was just a fake call.

509
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,340
Wasn't my acting good?

510
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,240
What is that?

511
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,160
I'm going back home.

512
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,670
So..

513
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,400
you don't want this?

514
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,330
Awesome!

515
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,240
It's looks exactly the same as the picture.

516
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,430
Let's just eat.

517
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,400
Let's eat.

518
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,510
It ended up that I couldn't help with anything,

519
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,670
but he was the one who cook the food

520
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,430
Now, I'm having an amazing dinner with Irie-kun.

521
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,570
I'm feeling like we are a,

522
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,110
newly wed couple.

523
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,170
I'm sorry that it ended up of you having to cook.

524
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,410
Well, then I want you to make me a sweet dessert.

525
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,820
Hey!

526
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,070
You, at least wash the dishes.

527
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,540
Then clean up the kitchen as it was before.

528
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,070
Oh, I will.

529
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,100
Irie-kun, are you going to do your homework?

530
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,750
Would you like to do it with me?

531
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,540
Homework?

532
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,470
I already finished it since the first day of summer vacation.

533
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,590
On the first day?

534
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,310
That's amazing.

535
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,930
Don't say that you haven't done it yet.

536
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,150
Not yet, how could I do it that fast?

537
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,890
For you, at least you'll take a whole week without sleep to finish it.

538
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,780
Anyway, wish you luck.

539
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,190
Oh god, it's 10:00pm already.

540
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,590
It took me so long to clean up the kitchen.

541
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,430
Let's start.

542
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,540
I don't get it.

543
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,490
I think I should do the English one.

544
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:24,350
This summer vacation has been nothing
but being chased by studying.

545
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,550
Somehow I manged to finish
Japanese literature, World history and English,

546
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,650
but I can't do Math and Physics. I hit my limit.

547
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,780
Dear Lord God,

548
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,640
and Buddha,

549
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,750
I'm sorry.

550
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,990
I

551
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,950
I feel like I'm a criminal pushed to a corner.

552
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,850
I'll take

553
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,050
a quick look

554
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,750
at the answers.

555
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,480
Irie-kun's notes...

556
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,380
Here they are.

557
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,670
Math and Physics.

558
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,640
I'll borrow them for a bit.

559
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,470
What are you secretly doing

560
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,480
in the middle of the night in my room?

561
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,830
Nothing, really nothing.

562
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,940
Then good night.

563
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,150
I can't do that.

564
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,830
It's just...

565
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,890
These are... Well...

566
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,630
I know (why you're here).

567
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,390
You came to Yobai (Japanese old custom for a man to sneak into a woman's place to sleep with her).

568
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,750
What?

569
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,340
Wait! Irie-kun, what are you doing?!

570
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,010
What's wrong?

571
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:54,050
The way you sneaked into a man's room in the middle of the night tells that this is what you hoped for.

572
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,580
Be relieved.

573
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,710
I won't... make you embarrassed.

574
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,900
Embarrassed...? You mean...

575
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,320
that (sleeping together) ?

576
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,360
No one is at home except us.

577
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,620
Ah! That's...

578
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,580
That dude said that

579
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,260
"Even for genius, you'll never know
when he'll turn into a beast."

580
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,820
Ah~! Wait a moment!

581
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,080
Although I like you,

582
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,830
still I think it's too fast for us.

583
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,440
We should start with having a healthy relationship first.

584
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,750
"Having a healthy relationship," you said?

585
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,130
Is that so?

586
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,430
You still like me.

587
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,820
Were you kidding with me?

588
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,460
Relax.

589
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,620
Healthy or whatever, I don't mean
to start a relationship with you.

590
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,530
I'll tell everybody.

591
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,800
That you attacked me.

592
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,600
I'll spread the words all over the school.

593
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,280
Go ahead and say that.

594
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,920
I'm trashed enough already. Even you say that now,

595
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,000
they'll think whatever they want to imagine, don't they?

596
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,600
I lose.

597
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,920
Hey.

598
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,080
Things you left.

599
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,860
Those things ...

600
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,340
Then the third question uses
the same formula, try to solve it.

601
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,860
I had enough.

602
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,770
Then it's not worth doing the homework.

603
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:57,440
There, just do it.

604
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:10,460
The last summer vacation from high school
is, in the end, all about homework.

605
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,450
Things I expected didn't happen at all,

606
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:24,220
but why would I feel like I'm somewhat happy?

607
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:29,630
Don't lose focus and do it already.

608
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,180
Yes.

609
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,360
We spent all night studying after all.

610
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,670
In return, shall I fix you a breakfast?

611
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,280
Please don't.

612
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,580
I don't want to upset my stomach
from the first day of the new semester.

613
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,590
Coffee...

614
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,990
What?

615
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,690
Make me some coffee.

616
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,430
I can do that.

617
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,600
Irie-kun, good morning.

618
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,700
We've been up already.

619
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,520
The memory of the last summer vacation from high school

620
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,820
is nothing I'm proud of, but

621
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,480
I will never forget

622
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,830
the scent of morning coffee that I shared with Irie-kun.

623
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,130
It's excellent luck!

624
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,380
Is Irie Naoki's first preference still University of Tokyo?

625
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,580
What are you going to do at collge?

626
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,980
You're going to take the center test (Japanese SAT).

627
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,840
-Cheer for him!
-Kotoko-chan.

628
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,260
I'll go to see him off to University of Tokyo.

629
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,520
Slipped!

630
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,950
No way that pill...

631
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,420
-Throw it up, Naoki.

632
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,700
Don't ever say this to Kotoko.

633
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,680
Naoki, what happened to you?

634
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,680
The lucky charm didn't work.

635
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,150
I feel like the girl and you are going to
be together for your lifetime.

636
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,830
Since I was born, it was the first time
ever I was that nervous.

637
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:56,120
Good bye, Naoki.
