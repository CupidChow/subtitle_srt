1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,440
Irie, moved out??

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,000
Will you go to Naoki's workplace to spy on him with me?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,450
What? Are they living together?

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,340
She fainted although her condition isn't severe.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,600
It must be a psychological shock.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,690
Naoki-san is...

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,240
at our home...

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,350
I know. He lives with you, right?

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,020
Naoki-san is tutoring me at our house.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,860
Tutoring?

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,130
I moved out to live alone,

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,050
why would I live with someone?

13
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:37,020
Yes!

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,810
Irie-kun was not living together with anyone after all.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,310
He still lives by himself and time has gone by...

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,020
and now we are about to have our first winter
since entering college.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,450
"Everyone will be smiling if they eat this..."

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,520
Right about that time, Mr. Irie and my father's old friend is...

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,690
going to get remarried back in their hometown, Kyushu.

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,770
With Mrs. Irie, they have decided to take

21
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,600
an overnight trip to attend the wedding.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
-Alright. -Well

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,960
Well, we'll be back by tomorrow night.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
Kotoko-chan, Yuki-kun, Please take care of the house until then.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,320
Yes!

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,900
Oh, Mrs. Irie, I made some sandwiches for everyone.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,060
Wow! Thank you, Kotoko-chan!

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,980
Kotoko... Don't give Yuki-chan anything bad to eat, okay?

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,050
I've improved my cooking skills, you know!

30
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,310
Are you sure it will be okay with just two of you?

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,040
I can ask Naoki to come home if you want.

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,230
We'll be okay. It's just for one night.

33
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,130
I'm sure Irie-kun is busy.

34
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,850
But still...

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,770
Mrs. Irie, you should relax and enjoy your trip for once.

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,280
Well, please take care of the house.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,660
If something happens, please call me right away, okay?

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,760
Then, we are leaving!

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,440
-Good-bye! -Have a good trip!

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,790
Well now....

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,830
Yuki-kun, what would you like for dinner tonight?

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,150
Whatever you want.

43
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,700
Here you go!

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,560
I made your favorite hamburger steaks!

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,350
Umm,

46
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,830
It was hard to make the shape of a hamburger.

47
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,150
Their sizes are perfect to eat.

48
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,440
Please have some.

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,250
How is it?

50
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,800
Kin-chan taught me this recipe,

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,830
so I'm very confident in this.

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,430
Better than it looks.

53
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,450
Oh, good.

54
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,960
Please eat all the vegetables that go with it.

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,840
We have plenty of soup and rice, too.

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,940
So eat as much as you want, Yuki-kun.

57
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,230
I'll have some too.

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,250
Actually, they are Japanese style.

59
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,550
Did you notice that? Japanese style hamburgers.

60
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,420
Kin-chan taught me this.

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,410
What's the matter, Yuki-kun?

62
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,170
Yuki-kun?

63
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,580
What's wrong? What's wrong?!

64
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,800
What happened, Yuki-kun?

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,710
It hurts...

66
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,550
What hurts? Your stomach?

67
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,390
It hurts... so bad...

68
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,190
-Is it because of my hamburgers? Oh no.

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,030
Are you okay?!

70
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,340
Yuki-kun, are you okay?

71
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,020
Hang on. Hang on, Yuki-kun!

Mischievous Kiss- Love in Tokyo

91
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,380
-This will keep you warm.

92
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,750
-It hurts.

93
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,920
Episode 10
A Confession on a Snowy Night

94
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,830
Excuse me, I'll take this.

95
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,970
His temperature is awfully high.

96
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,450
A towel. A towel...

97
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,650
Here we go.

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
Hold on.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,460
I'm going to make this cold.

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,300
Hold on a second.

101
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,440
Hang in there.

102
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,400
Oh, I should call Mrs. Irie first....

103
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,130
You will be connected to the message service center...

104
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,260
That's right.

105
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,160
They are in the middle of the after-party.

106
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,550
Irie-kun. Irie-kun, Irie-kun...

107
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,350
That's right.

108
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,230
He doesn't have a cell phone.

109
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,680
I don't know the number of his land line.

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,450
Hang on,

111
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,930
Yuki.

112
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,440
Yes, Yes, Yes.

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,460
Thank you for waiting, this is Japanese Restaurant Aihara.

114
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,560
Um, Kin-chan? How can I treat food poisoning?

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,400
Kotoko. Is it you, Kotoko? What happened? Food....

116
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,130
You got food poisoning?

117
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,600
Not me. It's Yuki-kun.

118
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,950
His parents went out on a trip.

119
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,530
I can't reach Irie-kun

120
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,980
because he doesn't have a cell phone.

121
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,030
Where does he live?

122
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,250
I don't know that either. He didn't tell that to anyone.

123
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,000
What happened?

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,940
Bro, what should I do? Irie's little brother got food poisoning.

125
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,460
How do you treat food poisoning?

126
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,330
Hand it over.

127
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,830
Kotoko-chan? What did his little brother eat?

128
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,770
He ate this hamburger I made myself.

129
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,800
Um, maybe it was under cooked.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,090
Undercooked?

131
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,850
Calm down, calm down.

132
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,840
You ate the hamburger too, right?

133
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,760
Yes, I did.
- She did?

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,450
But you're okay, right?

135
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,340
Oh, that's right. You are right. I'm okay.

136
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,520
Then I don't think it's because of the hamburger.

137
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,600
But as soon as he ate it, he got a pain in his stomach.....

138
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,690
There are many things that could cause a stomach pain.

139
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,440
It could be appendicitis or some other illness.

140
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,690
Anyway, he should be seen by a doctor.

141
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,670
-Call an ambulance immediately.
-An ambulance? Okay.

142
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,920
I'll find Irie and bring him to you.

143
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,230
Y-yes, please.

144
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,480
Call me when you find out which hospital you'll be at.

145
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,920
Th-th-thank you. Ki-Kin-chan, thank you.

146
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,670
Okay.

147
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,030
Bro, may I leave right now?
-Sure.

148
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,060
I will take care....

149
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,370
of the restaurant.

150
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,300
Thank you very much!

151
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,170
Excuse me.

152
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,750
Can you send an ambulance?

153
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,350
Yes, this is Irie Naoki.

154
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,270
Yes.... No,

155
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,710
it's Kotoko Aihara. Ko-Kotoko Aihara. Yes, Kotoko.

156
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,990
No, that's not it.

157
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,480
It's Irie Yuki. Irie Yuki. Yes, Irie Yuki.

158
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Kin-chan,

159
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,500
what happened? Is Kotoko okay?

160
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,650
She is on the way to Takao Hospital.

161
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,100
Anyway, do you know where Irie is?

162
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,900
I think he hasn't even told his parents where he lives.

163
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,810
The guys from his department didn't know either.

164
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,570
I don't think anyone else would know.

165
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,840
What the hell? I bet the Student Affairs office would know.

166
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,500
It's late. I don't think they are open.

167
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,240
I think

168
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,530
Irie tutors at Matsumoto-san's house.

169
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,690
She might know something.

170
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,360
Kotoko said he also works at a cafe.

171
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,690
-Which cafe is it?
-Well...

172
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,190
-Kotoko knows where it is, right?
-Right.

173
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,550
Yuki-kun, hang in there.

174
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,850
Hang on, Yuki-kun.

175
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,700
Yuki-kun, hang on.

176
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Hang on, Yuki-kun

177
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,130
She isn't answering!
- The reception might be bad at the hospital.

178
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,910
Do you know which area the cafe is in?

179
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,230
I think it's in Daikanyama.

180
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,400
Alright, I will try to find the cafe.

181
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,590
Will you be okay by yourself?

182
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,460
Daikanyama is pretty small.

183
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,330
Anyway, can you go ask Matsumoto?

184
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,440
Roger!

185
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,560
-Jinko, be careful.
-Yep. Hurry up, hurry up!

186
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,310
Irie-kun wil be here soon. Everything will be alright.

187
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,190
Naoki!

188
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,870
-Everything will be alright.

189
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,480
I will definitely bring that damn Irie.

190
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,900
So you just wait, Kotoko.

191
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,860
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

192
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,310
Excuse me.

193
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,990
Oh, it's a hair salon.

194
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,490
Irie-kun didn't come today.

196
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,860
Then, do you know Irie's address?

197
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,780
Well....

198
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,590
He hasn't told me that either.

199
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,990
I see.

200
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,400
So you don't know...

201
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,920
How about the name of the cafe?

202
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,450
The name of the cafe that Irie works at.

203
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,800
Royal Garden Cafe in 2-chome section.

204
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,760
The manager probaby knows his emergency contact address.

205
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,400
Thank you.

206
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,690
-2-chome section. Roya... Royal Garden Cafe.

207
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,230
Royal Garden Cafe. Okay.

208
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,830
How was it? Did you find Irie?

209
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,240
He wasn't with Matsumoto-san.

210
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,880
She doesn't know where he lives either.

211
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,900
The name of the cafe is Royal Garden Cafe.

212
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,010
But she wasn't sure if he was working tonight.

213
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,930
It seems like his shift schedule is irregular.

214
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,460
I'll try the cafe anyway.

215
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,350
They might know Irie's contact info.

216
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,520
Okay, Is there anything else that we can do?

217
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,000
No, you helped me enough, Thank you.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,670
-Please say hello to Kotoko. -Tell her that we are rooting fo her.

219
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,160
I will.

220
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,920
Presumably, he has an ileocecal intussusception.

221
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,450
Ileocecal... What is it?

222
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,480
It's a type of intussesception.

223
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,820
It's not a serious illness right now, but...

224
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,600
If we don't do anything, it could be fatal.

225
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,540
Fatal?

226
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,720
No....

227
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,570
Thus, we should perform an operation as soon as possible.

228
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,720
Th-then, please have an operation right now.

229
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,740
Please save Yuki-kun.

230
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,650
Excuse me, but are you a member of his family?

231
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,200
No.

232
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,050
At his hospital, when we perform an operation on a minor we require a family member's consent.

233
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,200
But,

234
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,280
his parents are away right now.

235
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,320
Can you reach other family members?

236
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,550
We need to have a consent form just in case something happens.

237
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,040
I don't know what to do...

238
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,570
Irie-kun...

239
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,350
Naoki . . .

240
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,270
There he is.

241
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,130
I found Irie Naoki.

242
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,430
Irie Noaki!!

243
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,740
What do you need so loudly?

244
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,860
Come with me.

245
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,720
Huh?

246
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Your little brother collapsed.

247
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,400
He is at Takao Hospital with Kotoko.

248
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,440
I have to leave for a little while.

249
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,020
Okay.

250
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,330
Taxi!

251
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,430
Could you please take us to Takao Hospital?

252
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,190
Irie-kun.

253
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,320
Please come soon.

254
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,480
Irie-kun.

255
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,670
Excuse me, where is Irie Yuki?

256
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,420
Irie-kun! Thank goodness!!

257
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,790
Yuki-kun needs an operation,

258
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,230
but they need a family member's consent.

259
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,860
I just did all the procedures.

260
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,890
Don't worry.

261
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,710
Everything is okay now. I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

262
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,840
Am I... going to die?

263
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,350
No, you are not.

264
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,840
It's a very simple operation. It will be quick.

265
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,880
You can do it.

266
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,020
We are ready, so let's move him to the operation room.

267
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,640
[Operation Room In Progress]

268
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,520
Please wait here until the operation is over.

269
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,290
I understand.

270
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,360
Thank you very much.

271
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,330
Now you can breathe a sigh of relief, Kotoko.

272
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,960
I have to go.

273
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,610
Odawara-san is the only one working at the restaurant.

274
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,890
He must be really busy.

275
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,170
Thank you so much.

276
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,270
Please thank Odawara-san for me too.

277
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,930
Sure.

278
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,720
I'm glad that everything worked out.

279
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,410
See you.

280
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,370
Ikezawa.

281
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,260
Thank you.

282
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,120
Aren't you a little too selfish?

283
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,730
I don't care if you want to live alone.

284
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,430
But you have to tell your family where they can reach you.

285
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,170
What would you do if something had happened to Yuki-kun?

286
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,880
I also came to Tokyo from Osaka by myself.

287
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,240
I understand that there must be a real reason

288
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,050
why you want to be alone.

289
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,860
But if something happnes because of that...

290
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,380
Not only you, but the people around you will get hurt.

291
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,870
It's too late if that happens.

292
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,500
A man can't live by himself.

293
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,790
It's important to say what you're feeling...

294
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,170
or what you're thinking

295
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,340
to the people around you.

296
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,200
Well, Kotoko, see you.

297
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,660
Thank you for everything.

298
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,590
Irie-kun?

299
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,390
Right, I forgot to call Mrs. Irie.

300
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,310
Oh no, so many missed calls.

301
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,350
We are at a hospital, you know.

302
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,950
Right.

303
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,620
Finally I got through . Kotoko-chan?!

304
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,140
Mrs. Irie.

305
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,620
Yuki-kun needed an urgent operation.

306
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,660
What?!

307
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,650
An operation?!

308
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,320
It's supposed to be a type of intussesception.

309
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,510
They said he would be okay since they were able to have...

310
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,480
surgery soon after the symptom developed.

311
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
The operation is going to end soon.

312
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,040
And Irie-kun came back and he's been staying with me.

313
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,550
Anyway, we will come back right away!

314
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,580
'Right away?' But aren't you in Kyushu?

315
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,120
I think you already missed today's flights and bullet trains.

316
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,180
Tokyo please!

317
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,320
Where are you, Mrs. Irie?

318
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,770
Don't worry about us!

319
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,000
Whatever it takes...

320
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,690
we will definitely arrived at Tokyo!

321
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,790
Tokyo, please!

322
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,820
-Please take care of Yuki until we come back.

323
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,920
Take care of yourselves too.

324
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,080
Mrs. Irie?

325
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,630
Thank you, Kotoko.

326
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,320
I was scared.

327
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,090
I was scared.

328
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,340
Irie-kun, I was scared.

329
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,540
Everything is okay now.

330
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,300
I was so scared, Irie-kun...

331
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,190
The operation was successful.

332
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,020
He can move to the general ward tomorrow.

333
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,410
You should go home tonight.

334
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,130
But...

335
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,650
You can't stay in the ICU room.

336
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,970
And there is nowhere you can stay overnight, so please come back tomorrow morning.

337
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,660
I understand.

338
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,760
Doctor, I really appreciate it.

339
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:30,490
Anyway, I'm glad that the young lady made a quick decision and brought him here.

340
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,170
It's not a serious illness if we find it early.

341
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,050
But there are many cases where people mistake it as a regular stomach ache.

342
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,120
It's a curable illness but could end up being fatal.

343
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,210
Especially when it happens to a little child.

344
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,270
Your little brother is very lucky.

345
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,270
You should be grateful to the young lady.

346
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,970
How was it?

347
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,690
He is fine now.

348
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,330
He will be able to move to the general ward tomorrow.

349
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,910
-I will stay with Yuki-kun...
-They said that can't be done.>

350
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,270
But . . .
-We should leave the rest to the professionals.

351
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,540
-Yuki is going to stay at the hospital for a little while. -So you should get some rest.

352
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,850
Let's go. I'll take you home.

353
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,260
It's snowing.

354
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,140
It's pretty cold tonight.

355
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,080
We missed the last train.

356
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,050
And I don't think we can catch a taxi in this snow.

357
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,080
What should we do?

358
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,820
You're right, I don't see any cars.

359
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,650
-Do you want to come to my place?
-What??

360
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,610
It's a ten-minute walk from here.

361
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,540
How about an umbrella?

362
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,510
Um, Umbrella....

363
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,160
Come in.

364
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,600
Thank you.

365
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,330
Stop staring at things.

366
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,680
This is the apartment where Irie-kun lives.

367
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,660
I'm in Irie-kun's room

368
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,010
with just the two of us alone.

369
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,000
Has Matsumoto-san...

370
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,720
been to this room, too?

371
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,940
No.

372
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,220
you are the first one.

373
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,390
You must be cold. Wanna take a shower?

374
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,890
Irie-kun, you go first.

375
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,920
I can go after you.

376
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,750
No, this is your place.

377
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:18,280
I have to call Mrs. Irie and tell her that the operation was successful.

378
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,820
I have to tell her that no one can stay with him tonight.

379
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,210
Otherwise, she might go to the hospital. Right? So please go ahead.

380
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,970
He is taking a shower...

381
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,090
and we will spend tonight alone.

382
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,590
Well, it happened once before at Irie family's house, but...

383
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,920
this time is different. Because this room...

384
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,100
has only ONE bed!

385
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,400
No, I shouldn't be thinking like this now.

386
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,620
It was nice.

387
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,110
hmm.

388
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,050
The clean clothes ... sorry, they're all mine.

389
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,720
Thank you.

390
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,570
Well then...

391
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,370
I will take a bath.

392
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,030
Bye.

393
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,660
Oh, Irie-kun's shampoo.

394
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,240
The soap that Irie-kun just used.

395
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,660
Oh, yes! Yes?

396
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,430
There is a towel in there.

397
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,560
Irie-kun's towel...

398
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,210
Thank you for the bath.

399
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,800
Sure.

400
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,950
I'm going to sleep.

401
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,840
Yes, I will sleep around here,

402
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
so you an sleep on the bed.

403
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,140
-That's how it should be.
-What?

404
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,500
You're supposed to say....

405
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,190
'I will sleep here so

406
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,790
why don't you used the bed?'

407
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,930
I was kidding.

408
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,360
-You can use the bed. -What?

409
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,150
Um, but if I do that, I would feel bad.

410
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,480
You started this. Which do you want?

411
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,570
Just go to sleep.

412
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,420
Um, but...

413
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,240
Good night.

414
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,520
-I'll turn of the lights. -Y-yes.

415
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,500
Hey...

416
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,030
What is it?

417
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,480
Won't you keep a small light on?

418
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,460
I can't sleep if it's not completely dark.

419
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,640
But I won't be able to go to the bathroom like this.

420
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,500
Geez.

421
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,200
-Is this alright?
-Yes.

422
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,520
I'm sorry, Thank you.

423
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,940
Then, good night.

424
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,400
Hey.

425
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,430
What is it this time?

426
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,270
Aren't you cold, Irie-kun?

427
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,000
Of course I'm cold.

428
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,030
I will sleep on the floor. After all this is your place.

429
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,110
Please just go to sleep already.

430
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,090
But I feel bad. It's cold...

431
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,230
Alright then.

432
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,520
I'll sleep in the bed, too.

433
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,910
What?

434
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,100
W-wait! I'll sleep on the floor.

435
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,020
That's okay. You will be quiet if we are like this.

436
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,720
Good night.

437
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,810
What am I expecting?

438
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,980
When Yuki-kun is not feeling well...

439
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,790
I shouldn't be doing that.

440
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,710
Good night.

441
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:32,640
But we're in the same bed,
and he's not trying to do anything with me.

442
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:39,890
Does this mean I'm not attractive as a woman?

443
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,560
I see. That must be it...

444
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,280
Are you depressed?>

445
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,650
I know you are depressed because

446
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,270
I'm not trying to do anything.

447
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,210
No, I'm not depressed.

448
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,280
I,

449
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,770
don't want it to go the way my mother hopes.

450
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,300
She finds out that you stayed here tonight,

451
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,870
just wait and see if something doesn't happen.

452
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,540
That's exactly what she would want.

453
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,710
Then she will control me the rest of my life.

454
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,780
Kotoko-chan!

455
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,030
You spent the night at Naoki's place?

456
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,650
I kind of understand.

457
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,210
That's why I didn't even tell my family this address.

458
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,980
So that was the reason!

459
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,440
You know how my mother is.

460
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,550
If I tell her, she would make a spare key, invite herself to come...

461
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,630
and cook three meals everyday.

462
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,760
If that happens, there is no point in living by myself.

463
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,170
No point in living by yourself?

464
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,350
If I kept living at home like I used to...

465
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,930
graduated from college, and took over my father's company...

466
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,260
I wondered if that was what I wanted.

467
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,370
I would be just following the path that my parents made for me.

468
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,790
It's fine if it was something that I wanted to do...

469
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,430
but I wasn't sure.

470
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,880
I wanted to live on my own...

471
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,020
to find out what I wanted to do with my life.

472
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,930
Now that you mention it...

473
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,170
when we were in Odaiba, you said...

474
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,210
'I realized that my life is more interesting...'

475
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,090
'when I am facing a challenge rather than having no hardships.'

476
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,760
I did.

477
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,460
So you didn't start living by yourself to avoid me after all.

478
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,640
Why would I go through so much trouble to do something like that?

479
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,830
It's pretty tough to live by myself.

480
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,790
I realized how pampered I was at home.

481
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,780
I see.

482
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,570
But...

483
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,220
this happened because of it.

484
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:58,230
You were always the one who was causing me trouble.

485
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,470
But today I was the one who caused you trouble.

486
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,300
That's not....

487
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,940
As for me . . .

488
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,880
this is the only thing that I can do.

489
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,250
You can do anything because you are a genius.

490
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,380
I thought about this at the hospital today...

491
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,930
That people's lives are dependent on split second decisions.

492
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,540
Something very small could make a curable illness incurable.

493
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,950
I realized..

494
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,710
how fragile a human life was.

495
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,750
It's a curable illness but could be ended up being fatal.

496
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:08,750
Especially when it happens to a little child. This time is no exception. If she had waited until morning...

497
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,110
I was scared, too.

498
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,590
Until then, I thought our lives were decided by God...

499
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,750
and there was nothing we could do.

500
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,600
But I feel like you can, Irie-kun.

501
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,400
You can invent new medicines....

502
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,540
Or you can become a doctor and cure a disease in a second.

503
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,010
You have so much potential.

504
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:53,820
You started living by yourself to search for the possibilities.

505
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,990
Even though there are millions of possibilities...

506
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,590
It doesn't mean anything if you don't know what you want to do.

507
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,150
Until recently I could afford to do everything.

508
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,250
In other words I was bored.

509
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,330
Now that my life turned so busy...

510
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:21,570
What's important to me... What I'm interested in...

511
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,890
Little by little, I started to find out what they are.

512
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,410
You are always like this

513
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,660
at important times.

514
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,910
I'm going on ahead to Yuki-kun's hospital.

515
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,780
Please have some coffee if you'd like.

516
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,850
P.S. We talked a lot last night.

517
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,900
Thank you.

518
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,660
Kotoko.

519
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,240
Kotoko-chan, we are back!

520
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,850
Is she still sleeping?

521
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:35,640
She must be tired, so please don't wake her up.

522
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,030
Well, I will put all the things Yuki needs together.

523
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,450
Yes.

524
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,900
Honey, come, come with me...

525
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,500
What? Okay...

526
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,120
Honey, over here.

527
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,530
You see? And look over here too.

528
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,460
It looks like this is exactly how it was when they left.

529
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,890
Kotoko is not in her room.

530
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,340
It could be that she hasn't come back yet.

531
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,190
Then where could she be?

532
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:20,610
But she said everything was fine on the phone.

533
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,910
Could it be...

534
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,680
that she is at Naoki's apartment?

535
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,610
No way!

536
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,580
Could be.

537
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,610
Since it was an extreme situation...

538
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:43,720
they finally realized each other's feelings...

539
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,070
Your little brother is doing very well.

540
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,390
That's great to hear.

541
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:00,380
The young lady come early this morning and took care of him.

542
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,040
He seems to have felt comforted.

543
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,240
Oh,

544
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,280
she must be so tired.

545
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,590
Let's not wake her up.

546
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,090
Your girlfriend is very cute.

547
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,830
I remember when I was like her.

548
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,350
'I-ri...'

549
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,270
Well, enjoy your stay!

550
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,080
Thank you very much.

551
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,600
Irie-kun.

552
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,490
Yuki is sleeping.

553
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,050
Yes.

554
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,100
It's hard to believe that he was in pain yesterday.

555
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,710
The doctor said he would be able to leave soon.

556
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,730
I see.

557
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,230
Can we talk?

558
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,240
It feels so good!

559
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,620
Hey.

560
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,840
You always say that you love me....

561
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,560
but have you thoughts about my feelings?

562
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:16,460
Your feelings... I know you are not interested in me at all.

563
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,170
Stupid.

564
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,940
That's not true.

565
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,820
The second time!

566
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,980
Oh, it's a dream.

567
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,850
I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

568
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:48,910
What's wrong, Yuki-kun? Your face is red. Maybe your temperature went up again.

569
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:52,680
Never mind. Don't do that.

570
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,380
-I'm sorry.
-Anyway . . . look.

571
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,880
Oh, how did you get this?

572
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,710
Big brother brought them for me. While you were sleeping.

573
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,950
He did? Why didn't he wake me up?

574
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,970
He said he was going to school and left right away.

575
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,760
I see.

576
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,410
Wow, It's beautiful.

577
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,870
I will put them in a vase.

578
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,470
Oh

579
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,490
Ouch.

580
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,280
So it wasn't a dream after all.

581
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,920
Nao . . .

582
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,760
Sorry for taking so long. Look at these flowers! They are beautiful.

583
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,960
Irie-kun surely has good taste.

584
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:48,480
It smells good.

585
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,920
Oh right. I bought you new underwear.

586
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,600
Antibacterial and deodorizing?

587
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,650
With a name tag?

588
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,850
Do people write their names on underwear?

589
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:08,770
♫ My overgrown bangs are gently shaken by the wind ♫

590
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:16,500
♫ It's still slightly chilly on the way home in the evening ♫

591
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:25,990
♫ Suddenly I think of the little happiness that blossomed in my heart ♫

592
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:34,380
♫ I realized many things when I passed through the cycle of the seasons ♫

593
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:42,780
♫ Many tears were shed and there were many arguments ♫

594
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,680
♫ Above all, thank you for your irreplaceable time, ♫

595
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:53,340
♫  your smile, and today ♫

596
00:49:53,340 --> 00:50:01,710
♫ and there were many arguments and there were many arguments ♫

597
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:10,200
♫ Above all, there's the irreplaceable time, your smile, and surely tomorrow as well ♫

598
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:18,510
♫ Your memories and your future,
Hold onto them tightly, so they won't be ruined ♫

599
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:29,770
♫ More than anyone else, I always want to walk by your side ♫

600
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,660
Um, can I come to the party as well?

601
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,480
Christmas is so great!

602
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,350
We will have a party to celebrate on Christmas Eve.

603
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,260
I heard you can't go... because you will spend
Christmas with your girlfriends.

604
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,070
Boyfriends? When did that happen to both of you?

605
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,080
Kotoko is going to be alone.

606
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,100
It's okay that I can't be with Irie-kun.

607
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,690
-A thief has been breaking into houses around here.
-Huh?

608
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:01,210
-It's a big deal!
-You! You! You!
