1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,060
This is time for happily celebrating

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,360
the engagement of Irie Naoki and Oizumi Sahoko.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,850
Will do.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,760
I'll treasure it for long.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,610
Aihara Kotoko,

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,960
PLEASE MARRY ME!

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,270
Kin-chan proposed to you?

8
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,210
So what did you say?

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,800
Nothing yet.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,740
So what are you thinking to answer?

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,530
I like Kin-chan a lot,

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,250
but I've been friends with him for long...

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,670
Well, that's right.

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,950
I think Kin-chan is more suitable for you

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,930
than Irie if you want to know the truth.

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,930
Satomi.

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,230
Because Irie has been showing unclear attitude about you,

18
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,710
even if he kissed you,
yet he's getting engaged to another woman.

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,580
As your friend, I can't forgive him for that.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,930
Right? Kin-chan has been only liking you from before.

21
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,020
You said it, too.

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,290
When you're with Kin-chan, you have so much fun.

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,370
I understand that you admire Irie
for having what you don't have, somehow

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,800
I think a man like Kin-chan is more likely to

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,930
have a long relationship with and

26
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,980
live happily forever.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,670
There's a saying,
"Women are more happy to be loved than love."

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,220
Take this chance to think about Kin-chan seriously.

29
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,800
Here

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,020
are the Japanese Sake you've awaited.

31
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,460
You're bright as always.
-Thanks very much.

32
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,650
I'd be happy If I can have someone like you in my restaurant.

33
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,720
No, no, no.

34
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,410
I own a Japanese restaurant, too.

35
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,360
Where at?

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,980
Well I won't tell you.

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,590
Tell me.

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,220
What would Irie-kun think if he finds out

39
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,120
that Kin-chan proposed to me?

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,520
Would Irie-kun be surprised for a bit?

41
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,260

61
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,100
[#16, Miracle of the Shooting Star]
I appreciate that you decided to invest a great amount of

62
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,690
money to our company.

63
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,410
Stop talking so formal.

64
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,230
We're soon-to-be family.

65
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,590
Let's live for helping each other.

66
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,190
Thank you very much.

67
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,980
So what about picking up the date for their wedding?

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,170
That's up to you.

69
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,330
Okay.

70
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,680
President.

71
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,760
Actually my father is planning to undergo a surgery this year.

72
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,230
Naoki.

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,610
Since you said we're going to be a family from now,

74
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,100
so I want to be honest with you.

75
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,010
Naoki,

76
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,120
you are something.

77
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,890
So I'm hoping to do the ceremony after his surgery,

78
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,460
and I'd appreciate if it's going to be sometime in next year.

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,540
Got it.

80
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,840
It's my precious Sahoko's wedding ceremony. It must take that much of time to prepare.

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,280
Let's do the "June Bride" thing.

82
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,560
Then let's say the next year of this time?

83
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,370
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,030
Is he on schedule?
-Ah.

85
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,680
President, it's about time for the next schedule.

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,530
Okay, got it.

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,790
It's like a dream that

88
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,800
I can become a relative

89
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,310
of a man like you.

90
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,300
Thank you very much.

91
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,980
I came home.

92
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,890
Welcome back.

93
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,740
I'm tired.

94
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,670
You're not fully in condition yet.
You'd better go rest up.

95
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,290
Ah, Naoki.

96
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,090
Thank you.

97
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,980
And yet . . .

98
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,600
are you alright with it?

99
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,540
You've met Sahoko and know it already.

100
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,310
How can I have a complaint
when marrying with someone like her?

101
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,360
That's true.

102
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,590
Naoki is really going to marry her.

103
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,190
We can't take it back now.

104
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,390
Aihara Kotoko-san,

105
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,200
PLEASE MARRY ME!

106
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,490
Marrying with Kin-chan . . .

107
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,640
I haven't got a clue . . .

108
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,580
Yes.

109
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,010
Kotoko, can I come in?

110
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,370
Yes?

111
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,870
What is it, Dad?

112
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,310
Kotoko, take a look at this.

113
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,600
Is this the new house?

114
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,750
Yes.

115
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,180
How is it? It's bigger than the previous one.

116
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,550
It's a bit far from the station, but the rent is reasonable.

117
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,800
Didn't you say that you don't like a place like this?
You said you like detached houses.

118
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,660
Yeah.

119
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,560
Well having a detached house was a promise with your mom.

120
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,640
But having a detached house is off my budget now
so we should rent a house for a while.

121
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,880
When you have a husband, then I'll try hard
to buy a double house to live with him.

122
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,130
Anyway, it's a long shot
if there's guy who would take you.

123
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,340
Dad.

124
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,200
Would you be happy if I got married to Kin-chan?

125
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,780
What?

126
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,150
Wh... What? You with the guy? What?

127
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,710
I'm just saying "what if."

128
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,410
Oh.

129
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,170
Kinnosuke...

130
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,280
Well, with his skills
he definitely has potential to be a good cook.

131
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,210
He's a good person with warm heart,
stupidly honest and decent.

132
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:16,350
If he gets married with you, I would be happy to have someone who can continue my restaurant.

133
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,180
Right?

134
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,920
No, you don't have to marry him because of that.

135
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,290
Your feelings are the most important thing to me.

136
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,670
If you like a guy and he makes you happy,

137
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,300
then I don't care about my restaurant.

138
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,860
- Don't look back, okay?
- Okay.

139
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,320
- After we come up here.
- Got it.

140
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,620
- Not there yet.
- Okay.

141
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,150
- Not there yet.
- Okay.

142
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,170
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

143
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,260
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

144
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,360
Now turn around! Ta-da!

145
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,240
Isn't it awesome?

146
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,030
See that, Kotoko?

147
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,130
Wow, so beautiful!

148
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,570
What do you think, Kotoko?
Let's go over there.

149
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,460
There is an amazing place.

150
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,680
A bonus place.
Look, look!

151
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,100
Come here, come here. Come over here.

152
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,410
Look! How is it?

153
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,570
Look at that!

154
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,700
You see that? It's huge, right?

155
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,260
It's amazing.

156
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,460
No one would ever block our view.

157
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,870
I mean...

158
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,430
I don't mind living in the same house with you.

159
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,250
So you mean...

160
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,730
that you don't...

161
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,750
hate me at all?

162
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,310
I just got many troubles being with you,

163
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,150
but I don't hate you.

164
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,620
Kotoko.

165
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,040
The Rainbow Bridge is over there.

166
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,830
Hey, Kotoko? Kotoko?

167
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,920
Ah, sorry. I was just thinking.

168
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,670
I knew it. You must be hungry, right?

169
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,450
Let's go eat some yummy food before we have some more fun.

170
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:35,210
Just like, you can't fight when you are hungry.

171
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,200
You're right. Let's go.

172
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,360
- Let's go!
- Yes.

173
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,370
Wow,the Rainbow Bridge is awesome!

174
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,640
What's wrong, Kotoko?

175
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,460
Huh? That's Irie, right?

176
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,190
- Come over here.
- Is that girl is his fiance?

177
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,210
She looks just like she's from a rich family!

178
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,120
Oh? Isn't this is Kotoko-san?

179
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,800
Oh, Sahoko-san, it was nice talking to you last time.

180
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,620
What a coincidence.
Are you two on a date too?

181
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,190
This's my fiance, Oizumi Sahoko-san.

182
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,920
How are you? I'm Oizumi Sahoko.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

183
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,730
Hello. I'm Ikezawa Kinnosuke.

184
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm a chef at Kotoko's father's restaurant.

185
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,860
So you must be the successor of his restaurant.

186
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,330
Oh no, no, no. I'm just an apprentice.

187
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,470
So what brings you here today, Sahoko-san?

188
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,530
Actually we were about to go to an art exhibition in Ginza.

189
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,110
But Naoki-san wanted to come here first, then go there.

190
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,070
He said there is a very special place here.

191
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,670
Sahoko-san said she wanted to feel welcome.

192
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,150
This is the place where we came together...but now you brought her here too?

193
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:07,630
So to Irie-kun, our first date doesn't mean anything at all to him.

194
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,990
So I guess he doesn't care about it at all.

195
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,620
That's right. If you would want to, why don't you two come with us, Kotoko-san and Kinnosuke-san?

196
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,110
Pardon?

197
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,800
Francis Bacon's works early today.

198
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,110
B-Bacon?

199
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,460
She meant bacon is sausage, she prefers sausages over bacon.

200
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,730
You shouldn't force them to come with us, Sahoko-san.

201
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,570
What?

202
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,750
It will be too much pain for them to go to a place like that.

203
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,750
So they should stay at their level.

204
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,910
Our level? What do you mean, Irie?

205
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,670
That's right!
Did you mean that we both are stupid?

206
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,770
That's not what I meant.

207
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,820
Naoki-san.

208
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,280
Let's go, Kin-chan.
Let's go to the place that fits our level!

209
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,320
Kotoko-san - - -

210
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,480
Sahoko-san, you can have as much bacon as you would like.

211
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,300
We will have our level sausages until we are full.
Goodbye.

212
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,810
Kotoko!

213
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,590
You both really suit each other.

214
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,670
Thanks for saying so.

215
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,860
What's wrong, Naoki-san?

216
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,190
It's not nice to tell Kotoko-san such a mean thing.
It doesn't seem like you.

217
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,790
It isn't like me?

218
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,770
Don't worry. I would never talk to you that way.

219
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,370
Sahoko-san?

220
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,120
You are a great businessman and you know everything.

221
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,100
However, you still don't get your own feelings yet.

222
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,070
I'll get going first.

223
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,510
I'm so annoyed.

224
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,630
Are you alright, Kotoko?

225
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,120
- About what?
- 'About what?'

226
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,280
I said 'about what?'

227
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,420
Never mind.
Eat lots of sausages
as you want.

228
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,370
Oh, you ARE eating.

229
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,070
Ai-chan.

230
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,580
Aihara-san, are you really leaving?

231
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,210
Yes.

232
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,610
We really don't mind if you stay, you know.

233
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:14,430
Please. Naoki-kun is getting married.
So It's also time for us to leave.

234
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,330
I feel like everything is coming to an end.

235
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,070
[Aihara]

236
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,270
- You've work hard.
- You're work hard.

237
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,990
I have to go see my customers.

238
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,840
So can you take care of this?
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,390
Goodbye.

240
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,290
Tomorrow is weekend.

241
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,710
I worked so hard this week.

242
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,190
- Senior
- What?

243
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,880
We will take care of this, so you can get off first if you want to.

244
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Really?

245
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,270
Then I'm going home.

246
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,120
Goodnight.

247
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,770
Have a goodnight!

248
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,110
Kin-chan, you been working so hard this week too.

249
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,510
Thanks.

250
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,140
- Hey, Kotoko.
- What?

251
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,920
Do you anything to do tomorrow?

252
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,340
Not really.
Do you want to go somewhere?

253
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,210
No,

254
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,420
but do you want to study together?

255
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,040
Study together?

256
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:44,810
You already used to working at the restaurant.
But I know that you need to learn the basics about Japanese food.

257
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,590
I need to think about my own course too.

258
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,050
So you can try my food as we study together.
That's a good idea!

259
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,800
Let's do it then.

260
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,840
- It's good, right?
- Yes!

261
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,190
- It's decided!
- Yes!

262
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,410
I'm home.

263
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,720
Oh Naoki, you're late again.

264
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,730
But Kotoko-chan still not home yet.

265
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,640
I see.

266
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,130
Is she cleaning up the restaurant, again?
She comes home so late all the time.

267
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,790
I wonder if she is cleaning up the restaurant again?

268
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,970
Maybe she went out with the boy named Kin-chan again.

269
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,740
Ah! What if she not come home tonight..?

270
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,850
Good night.

271
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,400
Hey, Naoki...

272
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,210
Aihara-san said they're going to move out.

273
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,480
Are you fine with that?

274
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,200
Aihira contacted me that she won't make it today.

275
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,210
Is that so?

276
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,540
You guys don't know anything about each other
even if you guys live together.

277
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,080
I'm always late to get back home since I'm busy at work.

278
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,600
Wait, Irie.

279
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,720
I heard you're getting married. Congratulation.

280
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,820
Thank you.

281
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,080
Long time no see.

282
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,750
How are you?

283
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,690
Sure.

284
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,510
Even if you dumped me, I'm fine as you can see.

285
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,690
Are you quitting college?

286
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,980
Probably.

287
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,350
I hate her.

288
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,440
A woman who doesn't say what she doesn't like is boring.

289
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,000
It's so like you.

290
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,190
Even if you become someone else's man,

291
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,740
please stay cool as you are now.

292
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,410
Good bye.

293
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,040
-Irie Naoki!
-Why are you at school?

294
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,920
Can't I come to school?

295
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,530
I'm a registered student yet; only taking a break.

296
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,870
Kotoko is not here anymore today.

297
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,980
Sorry for that.

298
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,490
I didn't ask that.

299
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,510
She went to the restaurant already.

300
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,750
The restaurant? Isn't today their regular closing day?

301
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,220
What, you know it that.

302
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,900
You know, she didn't need to,
still she went to work on the day-off.

303
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,290
She's studying with Kin-chan.

304
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,790
Studying together?

305
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,750
That's just an excuse.

306
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,760
Kotoko probably went to answer Kin-chan's proposal.

307
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,160
Proposal?

308
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,630
What, you didn't know that Kin-chan
proposed to Kotoko?

309
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,310
Jinko.

310
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,310
It's okay.

311
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,410
Someone is doing a marriage of convenience
with somewhere's lady.

312
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,150
Of course Kotoko was depressed at first.

313
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,050
However she finally

314
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,160
opened her eyes for real love.

315
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,260
Right, Satomi?

316
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,060
Ah, she's right.

317
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,200
She found the real love that

318
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,050
is not blinded by money, fame or title.

319
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,950
Exactly.

320
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,260
We have a date now.

321
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,000
Excuse us.

322
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,590
Ah, having a date with real loving boyfriend

323
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,670
is greatly enjoyable without money.

324
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,880
Right?

325
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,860
Then excuse us.

326
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,470
Good bye.

327
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,080
Ah~ It feels so good!

328
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,070
Jinko, your leg.

329
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:32,030
Kotoko didn't say a word about answering to the proposal.

330
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,470
Would it be okay if we just said that?

331
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,870
It's frustrating if we didn't put it that way.

332
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,680
It's going to be good medicine
for a cold-blooded guy like him.

333
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,300
Right? Okay.

334
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,780
-It feels so refreshing~
-It feels so refreshing~

335
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,470
Here.

336
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:01,250
Wow~ It's so beautiful. It doesn't seem like
sautéed beef with potatoes.

337
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,140
For Japanese food,
it's not only for the tongue, but for the eyes, too.

338
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,390
Beautiful plating is important as well.

339
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,590
Then please try it.

340
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,360
Yes. Thanks for the food.

341
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,510
Yes.

342
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,010
Potato.

343
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,820
I have never eaten this much delicious one ever!

344
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,860
Right? Up-scale foods are good,

345
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,490
yet I want to make home-made dishes

346
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,760
that everyone knows such as sautéed beef with potatoes,
sautéed burdock or fried tofu.

347
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,190
I want to have a restaurant that offers such dishes.

348
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,530
I think the root of people's tastes are from home.

349
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,860
Use the best ingredients and make the best home-made dishes.

350
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,390
I want everyone to know the greatness of that.

351
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,410
I want my restaurant to be pleasant
and feel like a home.

352
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,050
And there will be a female owner who is loved by everyone.

353
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,990
We can manage the restaurant together.

354
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,540
Kin-chan . . .

355
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,160
You know, Kotoko,

356
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,230
will you let me have your answer for my earlier question?

357
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm sorry.

358
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,770
Can you give me more time to think?

359
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,540
As expected, you can't forget about Irie.

360
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,640
That's not - - -

361
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,670
What the hell is it?

362
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,300
I've been watching you for long.

363
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,890
Please look at me.

364
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,090
Why do you like that cold dude?

365
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,070
Kin-chan!

366
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,410
I'll help you forget about that dude.

367
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,850
Stop! Irie-kun!

368
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,320
I'm sorry, Kin-chan.

369
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,380
So that's it.

370
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,990
It's Irie, no less.

371
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,590
I am sorry.

372
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,380
I'm really sorry.

373
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,670
Damn it!

374
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,170
I'm the worst.

375
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,960
I let Kin-chan expect that much

376
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,620
and acted like I have feelings for him,

377
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,240
yet the word that came out of my mouth

378
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,290
was, in the end, "Irie-kun".

379
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,690
I've kept thinking,

380
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,410
worrying and giving up at the end.

381
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,430
In spite of all that,

382
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,920
Irie-kun is still the one for me.

383
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,500
Seriously...

384
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,810
I don't know what to do.

385
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,020
Yo.

386
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,710
Irie-kun. How...

387
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,800
I'm here to pick . . . you up.

388
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,430
Picking up . . . who, me...?

389
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,020
Were you with him?

390
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,030
What?

391
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,760
I mean Ikezawa.

392
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,680
Yeah, right.

393
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,100
You were proposed to by him . . .

394
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,080
That's right.

395
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,480
It's not like I have no feelings for him.

396
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,240
How did you answer?

397
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,610
How I answer doesn't matter to you.

398
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,680
You are

399
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,970
getting married with Sohoko-san.

400
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,060
That's right.

401
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,830
I

402
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,450
will move out.

403
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,990
My dad and I have decided.

404
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,980
And

405
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,910
I'll get married to Kin-chan.

406
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,050
So I can continue

407
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,680
Dad's restaurant with Kin-chan...

408
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,210
Do you like him?

409
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,770
Kin-chan has kept liking since the first grade of high school.

410
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,380
Can you just like someone
if you're told that the person likes you?

411
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,500
What? Is that bad?

412
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,860
How many years have I had this unrequited love? I grew tired of this fruitless love.

413
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,680
It's all good if you just think
about Sahoko-san and leave me...

414
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,350
You like me.

415
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,630
You can't like anyone else except me.

416
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,240
What's with that confidence...

417
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,280
That's right, you're right! I can't help it.

418
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,600
You don't like me, someone like me...

419
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,490
Don't you say that you like a guy other than me.

420
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,110
Our kiss . . .

421
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,190
The second time.

422
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,120
It's the third time.

423
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,300
What?

424
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,130
No need to count it anymore.

425
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,610
We're going to miss you guys.

426
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,490
Later

427
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,110
we'll come over sometimes.

428
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,420
They came home.

429
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,420
Naoki, Kotoko-chan, what happened? Soaking wet. I'll go get towels now...

430
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,780
No, I have something important to say before that.

431
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,800
You should stay.

432
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,500
Ojisan, I have something to tell you.

433
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,270
Before that, you should change...

434
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,070
With Kotoko-san...

435
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,790
Allow me to get married with your daughter.

436
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,500
Irie-kun...

437
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,570
Fo... Fo... For real, Naoki?

438
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
I mean it.

439
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,340
I mean it.

440
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,130
That I want to marry with Kotoko.

441
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,260
Of course not right away.

442
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,210
I should explain it to the Oizumi family and

443
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,820
wait until the company recovers back to its own track.

444
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,710
I can't think of forever . . .

445
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,590
with anyone else but her.

446
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,680
Sir, would you allow me?

447
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,240
Naoki-kun.

448
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,110
This kid can't do anything.

449
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,280
I know that.

450
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,940
She's not smart.

451
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,180
I know that.

452
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,150
She can't cook.

453
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,710
I know that.

454
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,680
She's clumsy and falsely assume things that leads to failures.

455
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,540
I know that.

456
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,080
However

457
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,590
she's cheerful

458
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,000
and has lots of spirit.

459
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,680
She's also consistent and really a cute kid.

460
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,900
I know that.

461
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,460
Naoki-kun.

462
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,100
Please take care of Kotoko.

463
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,450
Yes.

464
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,060
Is that good for you, Kotoko?

465
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,250
Yes.

466
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,680
Kotoko-chan!

467
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,460
How much I've hoped and waited for this day...!

468
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:56,440
Father, I'm sorry to act as I please.

469
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,240
For this, the investment for Pandai
from President Oizumi is unlikely to happen.

470
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,750
I brought huge loss to the company...

471
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,950
That's right.

472
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,280
This is a serious situation for Pandai.

473
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,420
Dad, that doesn't matter.

474
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,810
No.

475
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:20,810
As an owner of Pandai, I can't allow
one employee to behave like this.

476
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,040
Sir!

477
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,110
If you say you still have to marry with Kotoko-chan,

478
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,690
I have a condition to offer.

479
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,220
You should resign at Pandai.

480
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,580
Dad!

481
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,890
Then go back college

482
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,780
and study for becoming a doctor.

483
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,850
Father.

484
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,120
Were you trying to hide it?
Don't think so little of your parents.

485
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,730
I knew it way before.

486
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,150
Pandai is a company I created.

487
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,510
I'll be responsible for restoring the business.

488
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,960
I'll also talk to President Oizumi.

489
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,980
So you

490
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,580
should chase your dream

491
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,990
together with Kotoko-chan.

492
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,620
Thank you.

493
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,810
Thank you very much.

494
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,740
Then, what would happen to your company?

495
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,280
I'll do it.

496
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,970
I'll continue Dad's company.

497
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:00,950
It's going to take a long time,
so I want you to hold it until then.

498
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,880
Therefore it's okay for you to be a doctor.

499
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:10,300
Then I'll let you do that. Please take care of it, Yuki.

500
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,460
It's all good. All turned out great!

501
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,280
Now everything's good!

502
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,170
Kotoko, we're going to be a real family!

503
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,960
Anyway go change then. Come down after changing.

504
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,580
Let's make a toast.

505
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,250
Oh!

506
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,090
I'm somewhat scared.

507
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:06,280
I'm scared because I feel like you're
going to be back to the mean Irie-kun tomorrow.

508
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,170
Then should we sleep together?

509
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,980
I didn't mean it that way.

510
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,390
Am I really okay?

511
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,370
Yeah.

512
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,470
I like you so much, Irie-kun.

513
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,750
I know, lots, huh.

514
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:57,430
But I didn't know that you like me.

515
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,330
You made me give in to you.

516
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,100
I like you a lot.

517
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,120
The closest Sunday to the day of "best luck" is...

518
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,220
Mom, not there yet?

519
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,380
A little bit more.

520
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,660
Seriously. It's Sunday early morning...

521
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,080
I'm sorry, Ai-chan.

522
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,700
It's alright. I don't mind.

523
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,920
Mrs. Irie, where are we going?

524
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,080
Wedding ceremony.

525
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,230
What?

526
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,950
There.

527
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,380
What?!

528
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,360
No way.

529
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,920
Of course for Naoki-chan and Kotoko-chan.

530
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,040
What?!

531
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,740
I didn't hear anything about that!!

532
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,650
Because... I didn't tell you.

533
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:29,550
Are we really going to have a wedding ceremony today?
Not just rehearsal or something?

534
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,830
It's a surprise present!

535
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,960
Ta-da!

536
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,470
Congratulation on your wedding!

537
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,190
Are you guys surprised?

538
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,530
Stop the face.

539
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,280
Go change, go change quickly~

540
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,550
There, there, there.

541
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,790
I can't believe this day came.

542
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,080
It's like a dream.

543
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,100
Yuki.

544
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,960
"Fair feathers make fair fowls."

545
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,370
Huh?

546
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,940
Can't you even understand this simple English sentence?

547
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,860
You're really a dumb.

548
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,760
Fair something... What does that mean?

549
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,440
"Fair feathers make fair fowls."

550
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,040
The beautiful wings make the bird look beautiful.

551
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,970
It means if anyone wears a beautiful dress,
that dress would make the person looks good.

552
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:06,200
What, you're making fun of me.

553
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,870
As a wedding present, I'll let you know one good thing.

554
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,900
Lend me your ears.

555
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,410
You look great.

556
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,550
You're always good at "looking good."

557
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,970
Ikezawa.

558
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,960
Kotoko,

559
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,930
I'll take her.

560
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,280
Seriously, she doesn't have good eyes for men.

561
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,160
Make Kotoko happy.

562
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,190
I won't forgive you if you make her cry.

563
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,970
Okay.

564
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,290
Don't be too relieved.

565
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,980
I'll be waiting for her anytime.

566
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,980
Right.

567
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,900
I just shook hands, but it's not enough . . .

568
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,780
Seriously, feel better, Naoki.

569
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,610
Right, Naoki~

570
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,090
-That's good.
-Naoki looks so good.

571
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,860
♫ Have you noticed? ♫

572
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:02,270
♫ I keep updating myself ♫

573
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:08,020
♫ Hopefully, I'll reach you someday ♫

574
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,470
♫ Where are your true feelings? ♫

575
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,000
♫ To think that you can neither avoid nor love me, ♫

576
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,670
♫ Isn't that boring? ♫

577
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,300
♫ I thought about this many times ♫

578
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:17,060
I'm not happy about the way this ceremony is processing,

579
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,990
but it's alright since you look beautiful.

580
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,490
When you're sick or sad, both of you should help

581
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:41,820
and be faithful to each other until your last breath.

582
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:46,910
Groom, please unveil her.

583
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,140
You may kiss your bride.

584
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,910
Hey, Irie-kun.

585
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,230
You've been liking me since way before, right?

586
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,510
What? What are you so being cocky about?

587
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,410
I heard about the second kiss between you and me.

588
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,410
Yuki-kun secretly told me.

589
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,110
That kid...

590
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:26,870
You were already falling for me back then.

591
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,740
Wow, I've never seen a Yamato Nadeshiko
(an idealized Japanese wife) like her!

592
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,740
Look at you.
-I lost to you.

593
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,500
I lost to you.

594
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:05,690
Like this, I became Irie Kotoko from Aihara Kotoko.

595
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,540
Congratulation!

596
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,480
Hooray!

597
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,940
Congratulation!

598
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,500
Congratulation!

599
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,430
Congratulation!

600
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,950
Is that a shooting star? In the day time?

601
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:28,780
The possibility of a person to get hit by shooting star
is one out of 10 billion chances.

602
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:34,520
The way I met you is a miracle more than that chances.

603
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,210
Look at here. Pose.

604
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,890
Three, two, one!
