1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:02,102
(How Humorous Are They?)

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,145
(Recommending
their first variety show location)

3
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,893
Let's begin. It should be fun.

4
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:07,234
What is this thing?

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:08,170
What is it?

6
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:10,209
- Look!
- My goodness.

7
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:11,897
- Hello.
- Hello.

8
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:13,674
That's cool.

9
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:14,956
Technology has improved.

10
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,988
- Here come the others.
- Drum roll!

11
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:20,762
(Startled)

12
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,880
- What's going on?
- They have entered.

13
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,318
Here they come.

14
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:27,850
- I can't believe it.
- It's amazing.

15
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,012
I'm so nervous.

16
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,759
(Today is a Partner's Day)

17
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:32,655
(How to partner up?)

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,129
(Choose each other's belongings
without background knowledge.)

19
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,698
Four of you have already chosen the items.

20
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,268
Four of us chose the items.

21
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:46,107
I thought mine was the only one chosen.

22
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:48,442
I thought the same.

23
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,525
(The items found their new owners
without notice.)

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,745
For real?

25
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:54,083
- What did you do?
- We...

26
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:54,876
(30 Minutes earlier)

27
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:58,016
(A-NA, IAN, YE-ON, and CARMEN
were called first.)

28
00:00:58,276 --> 00:00:59,686
- What are these?
- What do we have here?

29
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:01,322
An English book.

30
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,586
It's a doll.

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,260
I see a pen.

32
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,562
And this one is some kind of a toy figure.

33
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,186
(What item drags your attention the most?)

34
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,053
(A doll, a figure, an English book,
and a pen)

35
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,034
I like this one.

36
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:14,059
(The figure captured A-NA's eyes.)

37
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,469
This looks like you, YE-ON.

38
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:16,898
- Really?
- Is that a figure?

39
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,405
An English book?

40
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,374
This is cute.

41
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,877
I'll pick this guy here.

42
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:24,945
I'll choose this one.

43
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,360
I'll take this item.

44
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,449
- I'm excited.
- Who are the owners?

45
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:30,142
I got...

46
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:32,439
Here...

47
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:33,654
(All eyes on her)

48
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,523
(It's in my pocket.)

49
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,326
I chose this pink doll.

50
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:40,895
Why?

51
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:43,764
I assumed this one belonged to YUHA.

52
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:46,166
I was drawn to it.

53
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:47,901
We are destined partners.

54
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,238
Since it was pink everywhere...

55
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:52,787
and all girly and stuff.

56
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,038
(It's totally your cup of tea.)

57
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,277
It could be mine, you know.

58
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,021
(Acting kind of coy)

59
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,348
- She's being coy.
- What if it's not YUHA's?

60
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,818
Too bad, I guess.

61
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,452
Oh, okay.

62
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:06,758
(Revealing the item the youngest picked)

63
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:07,999
"Oh, okay."

64
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:12,092
I chose this macaron figure.

65
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:14,900
Actually, I picked this one
because A-NA told me...

66
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,697
I looked like this figure.

67
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:18,866
- That's cute.
- So cute.

68
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,070
I planned to study harder.

69
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,071
Ta-da! So, I got this pen.

70
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:25,598
I'm guessing it's JIWOO's pen.

71
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:27,468
JIWOO.

72
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:28,642
Ta-da!

73
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:29,910
(Lastly, CARMEN chose an English book.)

74
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:33,046
I wanted to work harder on English.

75
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:35,116
And I chose this English book.

76
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,484
(The items they chose)

77
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,352
(A-NA: a plush, YE-ON: a figure,
CARMEN: an English book, IAN: a pen)

78
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,306
(It's time to greet the partners.)

79
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:45,087
- One by one.
- It'll be one at a time.

80
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,294
- Oh, my!
- This is exciting.

81
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:49,849
Hold on.

82
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,070
I'm getting butterflies.

83
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,931
Drum rolls!

84
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,401
(Groaning)

85
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,336
(Groaning again)

86
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:57,637
(Shrieking)

87
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,105
(A cowardly onion has appeared.)

88
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:00,974
What?

89
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:03,377
(She's really funny.)

90
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,513
(Suddenly, JIWOO makes a move.)

91
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:09,642
(JIWOO stops behind CARMEN?)

92
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:11,819
(Dry mouth)

93
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:13,687
- Who is it?
- Who was that?

94
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,519
Which one is it?

95
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:18,192
(Moving onto the next after a brief touch)

96
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,060
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

97
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:22,028
Who is this?

98
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:23,930
Who are you?

99
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:25,599
- Who is this? Hold on.
- Who is it?

100
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,295
(Feeling her hands)

101
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:29,770
(Their eyes met.)

102
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,690
(Screaming)

103
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,208
I was right.

104
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:38,011
(The first duo, IAN and JIWOO)

105
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:39,240
- Let's have fun.
- I like fun.

106
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:41,373
And be happy and lively.

107
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,341
- Okay.
- Let's make it fun.

108
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:45,419
(JI-AN Duo's passionate footage
will be soon revealed.)

109
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,720
I like it.

110
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:48,388
Here goes JUUN.

111
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:50,455
(Looking mischievous)

112
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,125
(Which one of these three
is JUUN's partner?)

113
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:54,955
Hey.

114
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:57,865
(JUUN's partner is CARMEN.)

115
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,632
What?

116
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:01,681
(The second duo, JUUN and CARMEN)

117
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:03,537
You and I both are wearing blue.

118
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,072
We're The Blues.

119
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,608
Even the book is blue.

120
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,161
The Blues.

121
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,437
(Partners with a matching color,
The Blues)

122
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,507
(STELLA and YUHA will go
at the same time.)

123
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:15,683
(Screaming)

124
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,651
(The cowardly onion is making a fuss.)

125
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,954
(Meanwhile, the youngest one
remains calm.)

126
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:22,176
(So peaceful with a figure just like her)

127
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,997
(Where will this deduction lead?)

128
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:26,620
(Will it be YUHA as A-NA predicted?)

129
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:27,951
Gosh, this makes me nervous.

130
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,223
(That's why I've come.)

131
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,216
(Screaming like a singer)

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
I can feel her!

133
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,297
(What a singer.)

134
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:36,550
(Grabbing)

135
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,184
Who is it?

136
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,005
(So, it was YUHA!)

137
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,558
I got it right!

138
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,472
It must be STELLA behind me.

139
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,544
(She figured it out
from their conversation.)

140
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:46,803
(She is matched with STELLA.)

141
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:49,595
(Everyone is partnered up.)

142
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:50,951
- Let's be the top...
- How did you know?

143
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,203
- Just the first...
- Did it just click?

144
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,521
I just knew it.

145
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:56,656
Geez, I can't believe this.

146
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,792
Do you know what this is called?

147
00:04:58,792 --> 00:04:59,993
- A destiny.
- A destiny.

148
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:01,528
This is nice.

149
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:03,096
I guess we're really destined.

150
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,592
They're such lovey-dovey.

151
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:07,300
We are each other's fate.

152
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,950
- Destined partners.
- Destined partners.

153
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,605
- I never thought we'd pair up.
- I agree.

154
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,640
Did you want to be my partner?

155
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,543
Sure.

156
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:15,993
(Being cute)

157
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:18,679
- We're wearing similar rings too.
- It's quite the same.

158
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:19,846
Let's show them to the camera.

159
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:23,283
- We're a match. This was destined.
- Yes.

160
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,472
This is our destiny.

161
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:26,553
(The Matching Rings with matching taste)

162
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,256
- What?
- What is that?

163
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:30,341
That's the course?

164
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,485
(Please go to each pair's courses.)

165
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,664
What are those?

166
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:33,902
- Let's go.
- Are we really going?

167
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:34,927
This should be fun.

168
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,392
(Where are these mysterious courses?)

169
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:40,976
I'm so excited.

170
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,736
Here we go. Finally!

171
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,571
- Let's get into the car.
- Finally.

172
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:47,341
I want to sit in the middle.

173
00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:49,042
- Come to the middle.
- Yes.

174
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:52,205
(Right next to JIWOO)

175
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:55,215
This camera is very interesting.

176
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,132
(Is my face showing?)

177
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:57,451
Hi.

178
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:58,628
(Discovering another camera)

179
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,153
- Hi!
- What?

180
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:01,889
- Hello.
- That's unexpected.

181
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,625
- I didn't notice the camera there.
- I know.

182
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,918
- Victory!
- See you.

183
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,561
The Partner's Day.

184
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,329
- The light is quite...
- Look at the shadow.

185
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,466
Do we look better at this angle?

186
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:14,552
(They're also being awkward
with the camera.)

187
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,114
(Awkward)

188
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,336
(Nervous laugh)

189
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:22,810
Oh, no.

190
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:24,778
Let's just hold hands.

191
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:27,981
Yes, let's do that at least.

192
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:29,635
To tell you the truth, at first...

193
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:33,019
I heard the new trainee came from Canada.

194
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,236
And her hair color was
much brighter than this.

195
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,399
- That's true.
- It was light brown.

196
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:40,669
- And she was wearing a sleeveless shirt.
- Right.

197
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:42,763
I'd say she seemed very hip.

198
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,565
That was my first impression of her.

199
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:47,868
So, it was pretty difficult for me
to approach her...

200
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,804
because I'm really shy around strangers.

201
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,806
When I first met YE-ON,

202
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:54,937
she seemed so young.

203
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,877
She was really cute and kind.

204
00:06:57,798 --> 00:07:02,550
I've told her numerous times
that she could drop the honorifics,

205
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,018
- but she never did.
- That's true.

206
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:07,120
She's very principled.

207
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,523
Honorifics are way easier for me.

208
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,124
I wonder how others are doing.

209
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,543
Where do you think they went?

210
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:17,506
Earlier, all the other pictures
were fishy except for ours.

211
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:20,376
- Yes, they were puzzling.
- All three were strange.

212
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,552
- Ours is a sofa, for sure.
- That we already know.

213
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,247
- Where we go...
- But what are we doing on a couch?

214
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:28,375
But JUUN and CARMEN...

215
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:31,445
They never left that place.

216
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,045
- They didn't get in a car.
- Gosh.

217
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,070
I'm more worried about them than us.

218
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:37,919
Something feels too fishy
about their course.

219
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,521
They're the only ones
who didn't get in a car.

220
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:42,489
We're finally heading somewhere.

221
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:44,542
Finally. Where are we going?

222
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:47,360
- They wore padded jackets.
- They told them to wear warm.

223
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:49,529
- And get hand warmers.
- They must've got the real deal.

224
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:53,006
- We're the only ones wearing jackets.
- Yes, it's just us.

225
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,343
So, it's somewhere cold.

226
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,036
I can't wait to find out.

227
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,238
I feel bad for JUUN and CARMEN.

228
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,248
Well, it can't be helped.

229
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:01,341
- It is what it is.
- Cheer up.

230
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,739
- We're doing something outside.
- Right.

231
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,180
Fresh air.

232
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:07,642
Nice and fresh air.

233
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,682
- It's so nice to be outside.
- It's cool.

234
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:10,557
I like it.

235
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,853
- I like being outside,
- Yes?

236
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:15,105
but where are we heading?

237
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:17,490
I saw some greens in the picture.

238
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,192
- But where is it?
- Green?

239
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:20,527
Is it near here?

240
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,195
Where is it?

241
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,466
- That must be it.
- The bus?

242
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:27,801
- A bus?
- Are we getting on a bus?

243
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:28,894
Yes, you will...

244
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:33,666
(It was the signpost at the bus stop.)

245
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,460
(We'll take you there safely.)

246
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,144
- A community bus?
- Really?

247
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:38,912
My gosh!

248
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,234
Seriously?

249
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:44,424
Your pair's course is called,

250
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,517
"The Walking of Destiny."

251
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,021
"The Walking of Destiny."

252
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:50,457
- Why are we walking?
- All right.

253
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,293
Okay.

254
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:53,775
(The Walking of Destiny
has hidden missions.)

255
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:55,362
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

256
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,371
(These will decide their fate.)

257
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:57,983
(This one will play a huge role.)

258
00:08:58,178 --> 00:08:59,343
What's the biggest number?

259
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,934
I think it's six.

260
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:03,768
It's three.

261
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,038
(It only has 1 to 3.)

262
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:06,486
(The rule of The Walking of Destiny)

263
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,475
(The bus will take them
to as many stations...)

264
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,796
(as the number rolled on the dice.)

265
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,910
(Bus route)

266
00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:13,981
(They obtain ten dollars per station.)

267
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,717
Ten dollars each? All right.

268
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:18,795
- Okay.
- You have 50 minutes.

269
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:19,687
I see.

270
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:20,787
How should we do this?

271
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:21,779
(Quick return vs. more money)

272
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:23,890
Should we make it quick, then?

273
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,191
We can walk as much as we can.

274
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,160
Think of it as an exercise.

275
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,928
I understand
why we're wearing padded jackets now.

276
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,039
We need a big number.

277
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:32,499
Yes, we have to get a big number.

278
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,302
- Shall I throw it?
- I should pray.

279
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,837
Please, be a three.

280
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,006
Here I go.

281
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:42,335
(Please be the biggest number.)

282
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,646
(We want three!)

283
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:46,686
- It's 2.
- You got 2.

284
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,583
(JUUN earned 20 dollars.)

285
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:48,748
I got two.

286
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:50,683
- It's not bad.
- You should throw it now.

287
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:53,379
(JUUN, I'll get us more money.)

288
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,656
Let it be a large number.

289
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:56,586
Big number!

290
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,651
We want a big number.

291
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,248
(Rolling the dice)

292
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,220
(What will the sum be?)

293
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:04,498
(Currently, JUUN earned 20 dollars.)

294
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,646
I got three!

295
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,537
That's five in total.

296
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:14,417
(They travel up to five stations.)

297
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,877
We should move fast.

298
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:18,490
(Let's go!)

299
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,813
That's our bus.

300
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:21,715
Hello.

301
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,283
- Thanks.
- It's awesome.

302
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:26,887
This station is
Seongdong-gu Citizens' Sports Center.

303
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:30,890
The next station is Kyungil High School.

304
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:34,161
This feels like an actual community bus.

305
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,383
It's so cool.

306
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,965
We used to take walks.

307
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,566
We were always together.

308
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:41,701
We even use the same dorm.

309
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,836
Right. We're in the same dorm.

310
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,030
(What score is you
and your partner's chemistry?)

311
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:47,682
- Of course, it's 100.
- Yes.

312
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:48,789
- No doubt.
- It's 100.

313
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,276
Does that mean it could go lower later?

314
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,003
(Chemistry decreased)

315
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,980
That's not going to happen.

316
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,615
- That won't happen.
- Never.

317
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:58,905
- We're very close.
- That's true.

318
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,087
We had this thing.

319
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:01,221
Wait a second.

320
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,089
- It's 70.
- We're a 70.

321
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,591
I think this is the first time
we're out together.

322
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:06,517
Yes.

323
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:09,971
Let's try to get
to know each other better.

324
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:12,565
I know what JIWOO's hobby is.

325
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:13,619
What is it?

326
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:15,736
Don't you like animations?

327
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,013
- You like watching animations.
- Yes, and...

328
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,774
It's not exactly a hobby,
but there's something I'm into lately.

329
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:27,298
I'm very interested in aliens and space.

330
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,849
- The mysterious stories?
- Yes, the mystery of them.

331
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:32,085
Do you know that our brains...

332
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,998
are very similar to space?

333
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:40,301
So, for the people
who are inside my brain,

334
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,159
for those living things,

335
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:47,776
I try to work my brain in a better way...

336
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:51,894
to have a good influence on them.

337
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,473
That's been on my mind lately.

338
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:55,177
(Well...)

339
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:57,377
So, people are living inside your head?

340
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:00,313
That's right
because my head is like space.

341
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,213
(Her head is confused.)

342
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:05,118
- Okay.
- This is because she's a thinker.

343
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,497
Her MBTI type is ISTJ.

344
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:10,219
And mine is ENFP.

345
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:11,862
- It's the opposite.
- It's the complete opposite.

346
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:13,201
We should be The Complete Opposites.

347
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,103
- The Complete Opposites.
- The Complete Opposites.

348
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:17,739
But because we're the complete opposite,
we get along well.

349
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:21,235
One of JIWOO's charms is
that she's both pretty and handsome.

350
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,669
When you see her at this angle,
she's very pretty.

351
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,039
She's beautiful under the sunlight.

352
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:27,674
Look at her in this angle.

353
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,552
You look gorgeous.
Show them how pretty you are.

354
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:34,415
(IAN, the excited extrovert,
please show your charms.)

355
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,140
(Ew)

356
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,321
Come on!

357
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,252
She's not good with these things.

358
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,430
- Hold the camera for me. Let me try.
- Okay.

359
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:43,982
IAN is great with this.

360
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,900
Yes, but I'm not sure about this angle.

361
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,268
What do you consider beautiful?

362
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:48,529
How I want to be seen...

363
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:51,431
and how others perceive me
is a bit different.

364
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:52,739
I'd like to be seen...

365
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:55,335
- A sexy girl?
- Yes, sexy and cute.

366
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,607
I can proudly say that.

367
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:57,746
Okay, show us how sexy and cute you are.

368
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:59,606
Ready, action!

369
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:02,779
(No subtitles added)

370
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:05,082
(Genuine reaction)

371
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,049
(Embarrassed)

372
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,516
- Okay.
- Okay.

373
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:11,316
Okay. That'll be all!

374
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,695
I've never seen anyone like her
in my life.

375
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,621
Good.

376
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,292
About 80 percent?

377
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:17,439
- Maybe 75?
- It's 80?

378
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,859
- Right. It's about 75 percent.
- Yes, that's about right.

379
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,029
We've been living in the same dorm
for quite a long,

380
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,606
- and we were roommates.
- She's right.

381
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:27,956
So, we know each other pretty well
since we hung out often.

382
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:30,212
- I think it's team number four.
- They should have the most chemistry.

383
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,905
- Yes, YUHA and A-NA.
- YUHA and A-NA.

384
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,974
- I predict they'd say 100.
- Yes, 100.

385
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:35,974
That's what I think too.

386
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,515
- They're like a married couple.
- They're really a couple.

387
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:41,547
- They're actually in love.
- Yes, they love each other.

388
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:44,047
(Leaning)

389
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,925
(They say A-NA and YUHA's chemistry is
like that of a married couple.)

390
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,821
I look funny on camera.

391
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,590
- How do I look?
- You look great.

392
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:51,533
(Boasting each other's beauty)

393
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,037
- Is it on?
- Yes.

394
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,108
- You look great on camera.
- Really?

395
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,234
How did you feel
when I said I chose your plush?

396
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:03,970
I already knew
we were going to be partners.

397
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:05,435
(Her flirty comment got her thrilled.)

398
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:06,606
There you go again.

399
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,709
- Because we're meant to be.
- That's right.

400
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:12,346
What score do you think our chemistry is?

401
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,780
It's 100 out of 100.

402
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,083
I'd say 200 out of 100.

403
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:18,678
(She continues with her flirting words.)

404
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:20,222
How insensitive of me.

405
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,298
Should we do some kind of a quiz?

406
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:24,323
- For each other.
- I'd like that.

407
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,834
Let's choose between cold noodles
and spicy noodles.

408
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:27,352
- Okay.
- Cold or spicy.

409
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:28,328
In 1, 2, 3!

410
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,321
- Cold!
- Cold!

411
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:31,240
My goodness.

412
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,274
Beef or pork.

413
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,345
In 1, 2, 3!

414
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,346
- Beef.
- Beef.

415
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,871
- It's going well.
- We're such a perfect pair...

416
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,473
that I'm almost getting mad.

417
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,616
Favorite season.

418
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,473
- Among four seasons?
- Yes.

419
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:44,498
(Spring vs. Summer vs. Fall vs. Winter)

420
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:45,512
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

421
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:46,280
- Spring.
- Spring.

422
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,615
- Hey. Is this real?
- I mean...

423
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,498
I think we actually have some connection.

424
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,704
Can you see this line connecting us?

425
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,389
Let's try some more.

426
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,469
- Mountain or sea.
- In 1, 2, 3.

427
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,470
- Mountain.
- Sea.

428
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,393
How come? You love the ocean.

429
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,128
When did I ever say that?

430
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,633
They get sulky at each other.

431
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,999
They have a lovers' quarrel
over petty things.

432
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,967
Why mountain?
Why would you choose the mountain?

433
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,203
I like both. I'll change it to sea, then.

434
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,336
Okay.

435
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,263
- Shall we go again?
- Yes.

436
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,816
- Mountain or sea?
- In 1, 2, 3.

437
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:15,841
- Sea.
- Sea.

438
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,089
Okay.

439
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,352
Dipping sauce or pouring sauce.

440
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:19,378
One...

441
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:20,389
(Let's make up for earlier.)

442
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:21,657
(Dipping sauce vs. pouring sauce)

443
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:22,816
- In 1, 2, 3...
- In 1, 2, 3.

444
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:23,575
- Dipping sauce.
- Pouring sauce.

445
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,868
Actually, I'm not sure.

446
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,198
Dipping... I mean...

447
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:30,202
I'm not sure.

448
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:33,119
I dip it in so much
that it's practically pouring the sauce.

449
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:34,293
That's still dipping the sauce.

450
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,158
Right. Let's try it again.

451
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:36,704
Dipping sauce or pouring sauce.

452
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,338
- Dipping sauce.
- Dipping sauce.

453
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:39,232
Yes, we agree on that one too.

454
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,102
Being so similar isn't always good,
you know.

455
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:44,083
(Giggling together)

456
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:48,174
Other members are already
pretty fed up with us.

457
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:51,371
I bet they'll break up
over a small lover's quarrel...

458
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:53,074
and return after making up.

459
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:55,115
- We've been like this for a long time.
- Yes.

460
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,792
It's been about three years. Right?

461
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,794
- We've been together for three years now?
- Yes.

462
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,520
- It's a bit over three years.
- Really?

463
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,389
What are we really doing today?

464
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,327
- It's no joke.
- I can already feel it.

465
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:06,352
That must be so much fun.

466
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:08,261
- That should be so fun.
- I'm scared.

467
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:10,197
That'll show our chemistry.

468
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,896
Hello.

469
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,166
Where are we?

470
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,702
Where is this place?

471
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:18,438
We're here,
but I can't still grasp where we are.

472
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,540
(Exploring)

473
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,675
- There are books.
- I see books over there.

474
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,120
But they're all about psychology.

475
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,210
- They're about mental health.
- Psychology?

476
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:28,457
"Hypnocounseling?"

477
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,016
Maybe we're getting hypnotized.

478
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,719
Our hint picture was a part of a sofa too.

479
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,089
Past life experience, maybe?

480
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:38,767
- That's awesome.
- I think we're getting hypnotized.

481
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,791
Hypnosis?

482
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:41,435
(The Meant-To-Be's course is revealed.)

483
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:46,161
(They'll experience their past lives.)

484
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,883
I think in my past life,

485
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,847
I was one of the characters
in "Case Closed."

486
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:52,956
Because...

487
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:54,838
(A-NA is a self-claimed detective.)

488
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:57,010
Every time I watched "Case Closed" films,

489
00:16:57,035 --> 00:17:00,380
it hit me somewhat differently.

490
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,748
I think I was a person
from the Joseon dynasty.

491
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,181
(YUHA can make her laugh just by talking.)

492
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:06,361
I really like historical drama series.

493
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:08,755
And I feel very sentimental
when I watch them.

494
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,700
(She's convinced.)

495
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,105
You have a special mission.

496
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,826
You need to guess each other's past life.

497
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,771
The one who gets the closer answer
will get a prize.

498
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,065
(We're excited.)

499
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,933
Who was she in her past life?

500
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,307
(Let me think.)

501
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:25,380
(It's time for the detective to shine.)

502
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,768
(Will they be able to guess correctly?)

503
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,742
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

504
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:30,656
(The past life experience starts.)

505
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,478
I'm not supposed to get tensed, right?

506
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:35,181
- Are you tensed up?
- I'm a bit nervous.

507
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:37,950
Oh, dear.

508
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,918
(Monitoring her in real-time)

509
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,244
(How did YUHA predict A-NA's past life?)

510
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,232
First of all, I think she was
some kind of a detective.

511
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:47,302
And a boy from the Joseon dynasty.

512
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,471
She was someone who went after bad guys.

513
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:52,632
So, I think she was a policeman
in the Joseon dynasty.

514
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,001
- We'll now get started.
- Yes.

515
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:57,295
Please close your eyes.

516
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,292
Loosen up and relax as much as you can.

517
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,224
(She's also focused.)

518
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,819
You're lying on the grass...

519
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:07,513
and looking up at the blue sky.

520
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:13,987
White cotton clouds are floating
in the sky above your head.

521
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:20,527
Imagine your body is getting lighter
as the clouds in the sky.

522
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,197
Now, you'll hold your arm up...

523
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:27,801
and imagine your fingertip is
slightly touching...

524
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,863
that white cotton cloud.

525
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:31,237
From this fingertip,

526
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:35,281
you'll now slowly turn
into the white cotton cloud.

527
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:37,461
(She's fascinated.)

528
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:42,434
Your right arm and head are turned
into a cloud.

529
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:46,761
Your knees, calves, and now the feet.

530
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:48,087
They're all turned into clouds.

531
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:53,426
A-NA's whole body has turned into clouds
and become very light.

532
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:57,969
Become a white cotton cloud in 1, 2, 3.

533
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:02,328
(Is A-NA successfully hypnotized?)

534
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:04,904
This arm that you're holding up...

535
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:07,610
will turn into clouds.

536
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:10,276
Try to feel its lightness
as if it's floating.

537
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:12,801
(It's time to confirm whether she's
hypnotized by testing her arm.)

538
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,852
It'll float lightly with comfort.

539
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:17,877
(Floating)

540
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:19,419
Gosh.

541
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:21,621
She's just holding her arm.

542
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:26,801
There's an observatory
at the top of a very tall building.

543
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:30,496
And you see an elevator
at the observatory.

544
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,634
What color is the door of the elevator?

545
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:36,936
- Purple.
- It's purple.

546
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:42,809
That elevator will take you
to your past life.

547
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,349
This is so cool.

548
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:49,843
There's a small button by the elevator.

549
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:52,710
The button makes the elevator go down.

550
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:57,610
The light on the button just came on.

551
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,010
(Time to get into her subconscious
and the past.)

552
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,176
You're on the same floor as your age,

553
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,376
the 17th floor.

554
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:11,843
The elevator slowly goes down
from the 17th floor.

555
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:16,243
You're passing
through your middle and high school years.

556
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:20,343
A-NA looks very serious.

557
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:23,276
Recall the most memorable moment.

558
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,576
I played volleyball with my friends...

559
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,610
- in the school gym.
- Volleyball?

560
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,810
Are you enjoying the volleyball game?

561
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:34,576
I was so good.

562
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,476
(A-NA, the volleyball queen)

563
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,610
What kind of a student were you?

564
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,210
Chatty...

565
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:47,810
and always laughing.

566
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,076
- You're always laughing.
- Yes.

567
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,810
That's the same as now.

568
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,743
The elevator is going
further into the past.

569
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,876
It's reaching
the earliest memory you have.

570
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:07,043
What's the earliest memory you have?

571
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:08,676
When I was 5 or 6,

572
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:12,610
I followed my dad somewhere,

573
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:17,543
and there were many elderly men and women.

574
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,610
Did your dad love you a lot?

575
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:22,276
- Yes, he did.
- I see.

576
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,810
Okay, then.

577
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,810
She looks like she's about to cry.

578
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,110
You've recalled your first memory.

579
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,943
Now, go beyond that...

580
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:33,410
(Are you crying?)

581
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,843
She's crying!

582
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:37,643
(Confused by the sudden tears)

583
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:38,510
She's crying.

584
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,643
The elevator is going even further down.

585
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:44,876
This time, you reach...

586
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:49,076
your previous life
on the second basement level.

587
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,976
In a count of three,

588
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,876
the doors will open,
and you'll see your past life.

589
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,976
In 1, 2, 3.

590
00:21:56,976 --> 00:21:58,710
(A-NA's door to her previous life
is open.)

591
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:03,376
Recall your outfit.

592
00:22:05,743 --> 00:22:07,910
- Hanbok.
- Hanbok?

593
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,010
(Was she a man like YUHA predicted?)

594
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:15,243
Pink shoes with flower embroidery.

595
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:17,610
Pink shoes with flower embroidery!

596
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,976
(Hold on.)

597
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,110
(Checking something)

598
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:22,943
She wasn't a police officer, then.

599
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,910
You're wearing a hanbok
and pink shoes with flower embroidery.

600
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,843
That sounds like a woman.

601
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:31,776
(A girl in a hanbok)

602
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:33,276
I was 19.

603
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:35,043
You're about 19 years old?

604
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:37,043
I'm already wrong.

605
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:39,110
She wasn't a man or a police officer.

606
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,110
(Failing as soon as her past life
was revealed)

607
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,910
Get a good look at your appearance.

608
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,310
- I look okay to me,
- Just okay?

609
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,376
but people keep calling me pretty.

610
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,676
(I'm pretty, but I don't know it!)

611
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,110
What kind of a house do you live in?

612
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,943
It looks ordinary.

613
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,876
It has a yard,

614
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:00,443
many rooms,

615
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:02,210
and a gazebo.

616
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,010
Can you guess the period?

617
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:09,343
- About 200 years ago.
- About 200 years ago?

618
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:11,343
About 200 years ago.

619
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:12,576
(That's the Joseon dynasty.)

620
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,476
How do others call you?

621
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:18,210
- Bo Reum.
- Bo Reum?

622
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,710
Bo Reum?

623
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,343
Who do you live with?

624
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:24,010
Recall your family members.

625
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:26,243
Mom and Dad.

626
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:27,443
Your mom? I see.

627
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:28,543
And your dad is there too?

628
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,976
How does your mom look?

629
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,710
She's sick and struggling.

630
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,176
(It sounds very serious from the start.)

631
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:39,810
And how's your dad?

632
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,010
He seems like he's struggling
to make money.

633
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,343
He's struggling to make a living?

634
00:23:43,343 --> 00:23:45,210
To raise me.

635
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,643
(A heartfelt drama plot
about Bo Reum's family)

636
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:48,943
I'm the only child.

637
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:51,476
You're the only child? I see.

638
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:52,410
She's crying again.

639
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:53,676
All right.

640
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:55,410
(Bo Reum cries
every time she thinks of her dad.)

641
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,776
(So sad)

642
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:00,943
Bo Reum, are you loved by your parents?

643
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:03,276
- I'm loved,
- Yes.

644
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,743
but I dislike my parents.

645
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:09,443
- You dislike your parents?
- Yes.

646
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:11,243
(Why?)

647
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:15,843
I love being with people...

648
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:17,776
and want to be out and about,

649
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:19,776
but my parents keep making me work.

650
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:20,910
They keep making you work?

651
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,476
(A teenage girl
who just wants to have fun)

652
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,376
What kind of talent do you have?

653
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:31,010
I'm great at playing janggu,
the Korean drums.

654
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,276
You're good at playing janggu?

655
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,643
(A music lover, even in her past life)

656
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:39,910
Let's follow Bo Reum's timeline
and memories.

657
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,043
Go to where she's in her 20s.

658
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:44,643
In 1, 2, 3.

659
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:47,743
My dad is very ill.

660
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,443
He keeps vomiting blood.

661
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:51,610
He's vomiting blood?

662
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:53,010
- And...
- Yes?

663
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,210
- I can't see my mom.
- You can't see your mom?

664
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,476
(What does she mean?)

665
00:24:58,343 --> 00:24:59,776
She seems to have run away.

666
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:01,076
- Run away?
- Yes.

667
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:02,476
I saw her run away.

668
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:05,076
Why did your mom run away?

669
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,776
Because life was hard.

670
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:11,143
Because life was getting hard.

671
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:14,643
Do you resent your mom for running away?

672
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,376
I just miss her.

673
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:18,010
You just miss her.

674
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,376
It's like a movie.

675
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:24,810
Bo Reum, what kind of a life
do you live in your 30s?

676
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,876
I'm selling something at the market.

677
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,043
Really?

678
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,610
What are you selling?

679
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,710
Spinach.

680
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,143
- Spinach?
- Yes.

681
00:25:33,143 --> 00:25:34,676
I see.

682
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:37,410
Spinach!

683
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,743
(Suddenly becoming a spinach seller)

684
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,843
Did you grow the spinach on your farm?

685
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:44,143
No, someone gave it to me.

686
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,210
- You got it from someone?
- Yes.

687
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:48,110
- As a gift.
- As a gift?

688
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:49,576
What?

689
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:50,876
(The miracle of one spinach plant)

690
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:53,943
Jump to your 40s.

691
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,710
I'm alone.

692
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,743
My dad seems to have passed away.

693
00:25:57,743 --> 00:25:59,210
I see.

694
00:25:59,943 --> 00:26:01,043
(In shock)

695
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,543
She was alone all through her life.

696
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,410
What kind of a life do you live
after your dad's passing?

697
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,576
I keep selling things at the market.

698
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:13,510
What do you mostly sell?

699
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,876
- Zucchini,
- Zucchini.

700
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,710
carrot,

701
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,710
other greens,

702
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:21,743
and spinach.

703
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:25,476
(Succeeded with her business expansion)

704
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:28,076
Is this why she isn't picky about food?

705
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,343
Have you found yourself a good man?

706
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:32,610
No, I haven't.

707
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,143
I kept getting involved with bad men...

708
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,310
and got sick of them.

709
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,776
You're sick of men?

710
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,610
(Failed to find love)

711
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,576
Oh, no.

712
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,376
Jump to your older years.

713
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,543
I still don't have a man.

714
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:47,743
(I am single.)

715
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,610
Do you live alone?

716
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,843
Yes, but in comfort.

717
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:52,943
In comfort!

718
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:56,110
Oh, I have a dog!

719
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:59,310
It's an adorable baby Jindo dog.

720
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,876
I see.

721
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,576
You must see the dog as your child.

722
00:27:03,576 --> 00:27:04,376
Yes.

723
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:06,543
(So relieved)

724
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:12,810
How do people see and think of you?

725
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,510
A generous elderly lady...

726
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:18,443
who's very kind.

727
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:20,643
A generous and kind elderly lady?

728
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:24,276
I try to be kinder to people...

729
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:30,010
after growing up
with parents who didn't love me enough.

730
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,876
Where and how do you die?

731
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,743
I was walking
with a black bag full of spinach...

732
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,185
and got run over by a car, I guess.

733
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,543
Spinach!

734
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,276
A car ran you over?

735
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:45,576
(A car in the Joseon dynasty?)

736
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:47,876
It's a big black car.

737
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,643
You get run over by a big black car
and die?

738
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,210
Didn't she say
this was in the Joseon dynasty?

739
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,776
Try to feel your emotions
at the moment of your death.

740
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,843
(Getting teary again)

741
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,010
She's crying again.

742
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,576
I resent my parents so much...

743
00:28:08,143 --> 00:28:11,043
but I regret not having treated
them better.

744
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,210
What a sad past life!

745
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:18,910
Is there anything you want to hold onto
as A-NA...

746
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,610
among the things you had as Bo Reum?

747
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,076
I can't stop thinking about the dog.

748
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:27,576
(The dog?)

749
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:32,076
The dog is with me on my lap.

750
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:33,610
The dog?

751
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,010
Hug the dog.

752
00:28:37,743 --> 00:28:39,810
It's wagging its tail on your lap.

753
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,776
Hug the dog.

754
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,110
Put your hand over your heart...

755
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:49,043
and remember Bo Reum's life
deep in your heart.

756
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:52,810
You'll now be reborn as A-NA, okay?

757
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,243
Relax and open your eyes.

758
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,810
(Back to her current life)

759
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:57,976
Yes.

760
00:28:57,976 --> 00:28:59,310
(Getting emotional)

761
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:01,076
Good job.

762
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:02,676
Thank you.

763
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,876
(She got one right.)

764
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:08,643
(Teary)

765
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,210
How was it?

766
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,076
- It was...
- Could you see things?

767
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:13,243
Yes, I could.

768
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,043
- Really?
- It was so cool.

769
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:15,910
That's so magical!

770
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:18,310
Why did you keep talking about spinach?

771
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,276
I was a spinach seller.

772
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:23,043
I sold spinach for a living.

773
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:27,076
Let's go.

774
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:29,276
(The Partner Mission
for the eager beaver H2H members...)

775
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:32,210
(has been updated!)

776
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:34,743
(Bring on the mission!)

777
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:37,510
(Confidence at its maximum)

778
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,610
I messed up.

779
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,176
- Lies!
- This must've been doctored!

780
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:42,210
No way!

781
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,443
(It may be hard alone...)

782
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,610
(but so much fun together!)

783
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,876
(The final Partner's Day is filled
with H2H's best teamwork!)

784
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:52,910
(We're not done
with exploring their past lives.)

785
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,476
(Why is YUHA crying?)

786
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,485
(Stay tuned for the next episode.)
