1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:01,401
In the first round,

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,936
you'll guess the right member.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,609
Maybe she should guess things
about each of us.

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,476
I think so.

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,078
(What's the mission for the first round?)

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,714
(Find the member hiding in the tent.)

7
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,217
(This will test the teamwork
between the leader and each member.)

8
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,253
(Each tent has different keywords.)

9
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,622
(Guess the member
that matches the keyword!)

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,426
(They have only three chances.)

11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,793
(Find all the members hiding
in the tents. Then you pass!)

12
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,495
(Will she be able to find the food
and guess the members?)

13
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,131
(Stunned)

14
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,064
Oh, dear.

15
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,999
She'll pull it off, right?

16
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,869
I'd feel said if she didn't say my name.

17
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,539
Don't worry. JIWOO can do it.

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,806
Yes, she can.

19
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,211
- JIWOO, you can do it!
- Way to go!

20
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,813
(JIWOO also found out about the mission.)

21
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,314
What?

22
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,183
(A lot of pressure)

23
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,683
I think I can nail it.

24
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,353
I'm confident.

25
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,889
Guessing my members
based on keywords is...

26
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,224
a piece of cake.

27
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,861
I can specifically find YUHA really fast.

28
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,532
I've known her for the longest time,

29
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,266
so we know each other very well.

30
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,869
We're on the same wavelength.

31
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,307
JIWOO and I have known each other
the longest,

32
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,910
so I'm sure she'll find me right away.

33
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,546
What if she's the last one to guess...

34
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,715
after everything I said about her?

35
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,818
(That will make the show
more entertaining.)

36
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:29,622
Girls, I'll guess
every single one of you right.

37
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,559
You want pork? Or beef? Just count on me.

38
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,663
Wait there! I'm going to find you all.

39
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,865
(What are the members doing, then?)

40
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,501
- IAN, good luck.
- Cheer up!

41
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,634
- Bye.
- See you.

42
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,003
(Farewell)

43
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,738
I don't know where I'm going.

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,508
(They all entered their tents.)

45
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,243
(The first one is A-NA's tent.)

46
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,079
If she sees words like "horror"
or "mystery,"

47
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,081
she'll call out my name.

48
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,184
(Confident)

49
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,287
I think JIWOO will find me.

50
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,623
She knows me really well.

51
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:07,693
JIWOO is meticulous
and knows a lot about us.

52
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,863
I believe she'll guess all of us right
with the keywords given.

53
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,500
(YUHA, a true believer in JIWOO,)

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,667
(is quietly waiting to be found.)

55
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,336
I'm so nervous.

56
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,740
(Is the tofu girl frozen with nerves?)

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,874
I'm anxious and nervous.

58
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,876
(Groaning)

59
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,746
(JUUN has become Anxiety.)

60
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,749
Can I have a room tour here?

61
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,650
I want to see what's in here.

62
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,987
I have this at home too.

63
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,256
(Taking a look at the items)

64
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,491
Is there food too?

65
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,393
(Checking under the bed in search of food)

66
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,095
My life is up to JIWOO.

67
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,265
(The sunny girl is just having fun.)

68
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,800
(Lastly, YE-ON)

69
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,503
Guys, can you hear me?

70
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:54,707
I am shaking with nerves.

71
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,378
I hope JIWOO finds me as soon as possible.

72
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,048
Do I start now?

73
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,950
Do I start from the farthest tent?

74
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,453
Oh, gosh!

75
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,521
Hold up.

76
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,692
It looks harder than I thought.

77
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,227
Wait.

78
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,265
She's coming now.

79
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,466
Is she here?

80
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,967
She's here.

81
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,269
She's getting...

82
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,670
closer to the tent.

83
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,406
(The sunny girl is excited.)

84
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,175
(Checking the keywords of the first tent)

85
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,345
(Alphabet "E")

86
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,747
(A photo of the finger heart)

87
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,857
(Frog)

88
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,082
(Which member is in the first tent?)

89
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,484
When did she take a photo of her hand?

90
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,421
I guess everyone did except for me.

91
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:44,857
A photo of a hand?

92
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,692
A week ago,

93
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,196
all of us were told to take one each.

94
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,097
I didn't know it was for this.

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,504
There's only one extrovert member
in our team.

96
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,605
"Frog."

97
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:03,309
We even formed a duo and named it "Frogs."

98
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,144
It's so easy.

99
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,546
Do I just call her name?

100
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:13,686
(Who does JIWOO think is
staying in the first tent?)

101
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,255
IAN, come out!

102
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,393
(Is IAN really in the first tent?)

103
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,561
What?

104
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,032
(Loud appearance)

105
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,100
(Extrovert IAN is here!)

106
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,203
(She succeeded in guessing
the first tent's member.)

107
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,704
- We're Frogs.
- I got it right.

108
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,140
How did you know that?

109
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,075
They all pointed to you.

110
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,410
Did you like the photo of my hand?

111
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,544
- I took it for you.
- Is the heart for me?

112
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,646
That's right.

113
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,915
If other keywords aren't so difficult,

114
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,985
I think I can find other members too.

115
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,553
She got it!

116
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,088
(A party has already begun here.)

117
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,189
You can do it!

118
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,458
(I knew you'd make it!)

119
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,692
She can do it.

120
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,060
(Positive energy)

121
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,662
I'll get ready to be called out.

122
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,665
I can't wait.

123
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,567
I need some stretching now.

124
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,770
(Stretching hard)

125
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,439
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

126
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,909
Please find me too.

127
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,847
It's time to try the second tent.

128
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,849
Wait!

129
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,518
- What's this?
- What are those?

130
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,288
- "MVP."
- "MVP."

131
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:23,289
- A photo of the hands.
- "Corn."

132
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,557
MVP?

133
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,626
- MVP of what?
- MVP of what?

134
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,361
What about corn?

135
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,229
Why corn, anyway?

136
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,499
Is there a member who likes corn?

137
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,001
(Let me think.)

138
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,738
(Changing the target to the hand photo)

139
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,639
(Looking carefully)

140
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,675
I think I know the answer.

141
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,011
- Who is it?
- It's either STELLA or YUHA.

142
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,948
Or YE-ON.

143
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,949
Look at this.

144
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,653
Not many members have
such small and cute hands.

145
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,288
(The three have adorable, tiny hands.)

146
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,891
They say I can go wrong twice.

147
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,560
Still, I have to guess everyone right.

148
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,028
- Exactly.
- They're all my members.

149
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,129
How about trying a telepathic connection?

150
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,564
(Let's call upon the universe for help.)

151
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,267
We put our hands on the wall.

152
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,803
(Shaking)

153
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:11,904
Here?

154
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,273
(No spoilers!
This member is tapping the wall hard.)

155
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,207
Oh, no!

156
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,976
No way.

157
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,945
(Will one of the three be in the tent?)

158
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,614
Seeing how she tapped the wall,
it's not YE-ON.

159
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,717
- If there's a twist, it could be YE-ON.
- I doubt it.

160
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,121
(There are two candidates now.)

161
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,822
It must be YUHA.

162
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,658
But the keywords don't indicate YUHA.

163
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,059
I don't think it's her.

164
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,962
(Then, is it STELLA, the last one?)

165
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,665
But look. It's all in English.

166
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,835
- It must be STELLA.
- Let's call her name.

167
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,859
- Sounds great. Let's do it.
- I'm sure it's her.

168
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,672
STELLA, come out, please, if it's you.

169
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,440
Please come out.

170
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,642
(Will she make the right guess again?)

171
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,178
- It's not her.
- Oh, no.

172
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,632
- Let's move on to the next tent.
- Let's move.

173
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,417
Oh, my. She just called my name.

174
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,186
But it's not me!

175
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,791
She got it wrong once, right?

176
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,560
What?

177
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,362
(It's no good.)

178
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,365
Once I'm out, it's all over.

179
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,467
Now, I'll start praying.

180
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,569
(Please guess the rest right!)

181
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,207
(With only one chance to get it wrong,
there are six members left.)

182
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,108
It's YUHA.

183
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,277
Really?

184
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,813
- How could it be her?
- I've known YUHA for the longest time.

185
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,626
(They'll visit the third tent for now.)

186
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,652
"Only One."

187
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,488
That cute baby sound must be JUUN.

188
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,491
- It's just so obvious.
- It's JUUN, for sure.

189
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,292
Let's say her name right away. Shall we?

190
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,494
Why does "Only One" remind me of JUUN?

191
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,397
She started to dream
of becoming a singer...

192
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,599
- after watching the "Only One" stage.
- Right.

193
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,535
That's what made her have a dream
of becoming an idol singer.

194
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,140
The way BoA completely took
over the stage...

195
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,274
fascinated me so much...

196
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,444
and made me want to become a singer too.

197
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,678
That baby sound.

198
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,446
JUUN tries to appeal to her cute side...

199
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,449
- Right.
- quietly.

200
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,053
(Master of natural cuteness)

201
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,288
(Based on all the given clues,)

202
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,691
(it's JUUN, of course.)

203
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,660
(She's become Happy from Anxiety.)

204
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,129
Look at the hands.

205
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,933
JUUN has a habit of picking off
the hangnails.

206
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,803
And these hands look very dry.

207
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,338
- The skin is peeling off.
- You noticed such detail.

208
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,873
Also,

209
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,610
JUUN's pinky won't bend
when she makes a heart with her hands.

210
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,379
Look, it's straight.

211
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,448
(She's happy to be recognized.)

212
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,649
- Let's call her.
- Let's do it.

213
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,020
In 1, 2, 3.

214
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,886
- JUUN!
- JUUN, come out!

215
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,321
JUUN!

216
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,289
(Quiet)

217
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,257
No way.

218
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,659
Please.

219
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,527
JUUN?

220
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,329
JUUN!

221
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,298
Please come out.

222
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,066
(Shaking stiffly)

223
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,067
Oh, gosh.

224
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,835
(Ta-da!)

225
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,871
(An unexpected thrill)

226
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,206
Hey!

227
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,741
You really got it right away.

228
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,009
(Here's to our teamwork!)

229
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,845
She found JUUN.

230
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,681
Geez. It must be fun.

231
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,048
I want to go out too.

232
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,753
While waiting, I'll show you my specialty.

233
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,522
Finger magic!

234
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,257
Ta-da!

235
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,894
(Her long fingers are very flexible.)

236
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,062
Look.

237
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,664
(One-of-a-kind specialty)

238
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,624
I think she'll notice
as soon as she sees a photo of my hand.

239
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,601
(Find me!)

240
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,602
This is the tent.

241
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,438
- Hold up. "Long hair."
- "Long hair." "164cm?"

242
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,642
(Long hair, finger heart, 164cm)

243
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,744
Look at her hands.

244
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,844
It's YE-ON, for sure.

245
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,281
- It's obviously YE-ON.
- Absolutely.

246
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,583
It says she's 164cm...

247
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,585
- Is it YE-ON's height?
- She's 165cm tall.

248
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,953
Right?

249
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,223
She said she was 165.5cm tall
on the way here.

250
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,126
- She's not 164cm.
- Did they pick the wrong keyword, then?

251
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,761
YE-ON,

252
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,030
you can become the tallest member later.

253
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,199
- Right.
- Do you think so?

254
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,701
- I want to grow taller.
- I think so.

255
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,736
How tall are you now?

256
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,838
I'm 165.5cm tall.

257
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,641
You're already tall enough.

258
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,279
Don't you and YUHA always fight,
saying each is 164cm tall?

259
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,578
And she has long hair too!

260
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,914
Isn't it YUHA?

261
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,718
- YUHA?
- But her hands don't look like this.

262
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,986
YUHA's nails aren't like these.

263
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,388
- Look closely.
- It's YE-ON's hands.

264
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,590
Right. They're YE-ON's.

265
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,828
I'm sure they are YE-ON's hands.

266
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,163
Then why does it say 164cm?

267
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,765
Could the staff have mistaken the photo?

268
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,367
The hands are certainly YE-ON's,

269
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,771
- but "Long hair" reminds me of YUHA.
- Right.

270
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,407
- But YE-ON also has pretty long hair.
- That's true.

271
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,175
- But she's not 164cm tall.
- She is not.

272
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,843
I know.

273
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,346
- What's going on?
- Maybe she took her height at night.

274
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,949
(Such an unexpected reasoning)

275
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,150
So, the staff thought she was 164cm tall.

276
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,453
That makes sense.

277
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,587
I don't think so.

278
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,789
I think it's YUHA.

279
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,458
But you said these are YE-ON's hands.

280
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,260
(Having a headache)

281
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,696
But I'm sure these are YE-ON's hands.

282
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,699
I'm confident as her roommate.

283
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
It's YE-ON.

284
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,952
(Is it YUHA or YE-ON?)

285
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,905
- Should we say her name, then?
- YE-ON.

286
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,208
What if it's not her?

287
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,609
- Then...
- Shall we go for it?

288
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,176
Say it on the count of three.

289
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,312
- Are you sure about it?
- Let's just take a chance.

290
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,147
In 1, 2, 3.

291
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,449
- YE-ON, come out!
- YE-ON, come out!

292
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,284
Please come out.

293
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,553
- Please.
- Our youngest.

294
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,256
- Please.
- Please, YE-ON.

295
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,160
I said she was 165.5cm tall.

296
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,163
You have one chance left.

297
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,233
(But there are five members left.)

298
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,801
(It's not me!)

299
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,837
She has only one chance left.

300
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,874
(Deep sigh)

301
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,477
(You're wrong!)

302
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,178
This isn't good.

303
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,648
Will we lose our meat?

304
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,950
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

305
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,820
Then, who is in that tent?

306
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,589
(Heading toward the fifth tent)

307
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,823
- A-NA!
- A-NA!

308
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,024
- A-NA!
- Hi.

309
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,459
It can't be anyone but A-NA.

310
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,760
("Mystery" means it's A-NA.)

311
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,295
- Here is "Mystery."
- "Mystery."

312
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,998
So, "a" equals "Yu Na."

313
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,399
The "y" is her name.

314
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,335
- You're so smart. I think she's right.
- Shall we call her out?

315
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,438
- A-NA!
- A-NA, come out!

316
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,042
(A-NA was in the fifth tent.)

317
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,046
Are there only this many of you?

318
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,447
- We have just one more chance left.
- One chance.

319
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,650
- We have one chance left.
- Just count on me.

320
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,753
- You know the first one...
- Time to realize my dream.

321
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,787
Yes.

322
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,923
This is CARMEN, for sure.

323
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,658
- It's CARMEN.
- It is.

324
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,460
(Do these keywords refer to CARMEN?)

325
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,962
The hands are CARMEN's.

326
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,665
(Is it CARMEN, like everyone guessed?)

327
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,668
(Or could it be one of the three?)

328
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,440
- This one is...
- Tteokbokki is CARMEN's favorite food.

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,807
- That's right.
- Yes.

330
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,477
The knuckles are thin and soft.

331
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,112
I'm sure it's her.

332
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,314
(Who's inside the sixth tent?)

333
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,382
Right.

334
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,786
Tteokbokki is my favorite food.

335
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,821
I have really long fingers,

336
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,357
so I bet they'll notice
once they see my fingers making a heart.

337
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:13,559
They're long.

338
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,693
(The hand detective noticed it from afar.)

339
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,730
I'm going to hide!

340
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,365
(Hiding myself)

341
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,468
(She's hiding
from her members' reasoning.)

342
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,663
(A hand heart and tteokbokki)

343
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,772
(What is the keyword that's left?)

344
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,607
It's CARMEN when it comes to opera.

345
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,443
("Carmen," composed by Georges Bizet)

346
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,477
Should we call her out?

347
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,946
- CARMEN!
- CARMEN!

348
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,917
(The crowd waits for the door to open.)

349
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,856
(CARMEN, also known as the Opera)

350
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,391
- Let's go!
- Come out.

351
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:47,993
Here she is.

352
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,979
(The opera star finally appears.)

353
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,100
(Celebrating on the wooden stage)

354
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,692
- You're cute.
- Well done.

355
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,138
Currently, we got it wrong a few times.

356
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,741
YE-ON, YUHA, and STEALLA are left.

357
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,476
I think we can get them right.

358
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,479
(Now, it's my turn to step up.)

359
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,913
(The keywords for the seventh tent)

360
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,749
- "Gemini?"
- Oh, this one is...

361
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,250
What months are the Gemini?

362
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,619
Which months does Gemini cover?

363
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,155
- They wouldn't tell us.
- They're not telling.

364
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,059
(Sting operation failed.)

365
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,426
This must be YUHA.

366
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,228
YUHA isn't the Gemini.

367
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,941
(Then, is it one of these two?)

368
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,833
These are STELLA's hands! This mole!

369
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,437
- There's a mole?
- Doesn't STELLA have a mole on her hand?

370
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,571
This one is pink,
and the one below is purple.

371
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,741
Someone who likes pink and purple.

372
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,076
- STELLA!
- It has to be STELLA!

373
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,078
(She's the finalist.)

374
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,546
- In 1, 2, 3!
- In 1, 2, 3!

375
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,248
- STELLA!
- STELLA!

376
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,618
(Will it be STELLA?)

377
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,655
(Who's in the seventh tent?)

378
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,656
Come out.

379
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,226
(It is STELLA.)

380
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,796
(Celebrating on her own)

381
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,263
How did you know?

382
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,398
(We have an awesome teamwork.)

383
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,701
I heard you guys guessing.

384
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,769
Really?

385
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,672
(The moment others approached her tent)

386
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,938
(On her feet)

387
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,554
These are STELLA's hands! This mole!

388
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,677
(She was amazed
by the hand detective's skill.)

389
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,312
(My birthday is June 18,
so my zodiac sign is Gemini!)

390
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,648
(That's correct!)

391
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,788
(A silent approval)

392
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,884
- I got your favorite colors right.
- You did?

393
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,154
(However, this keyword was...)

394
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,332
(Red and white, red and blue)

395
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,557
(symbolizing STELLA's dual nationality)

396
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,659
(Cheering from outside)

397
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,793
So, are there YE-ON...

398
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,997
- and me left?
- Please call me out already.

399
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,199
- Let's check your current status.
- Okay.

400
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:36,368
(There are eight tents to guess.)

401
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,336
(So far, JIWOO has found five members.)

402
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,272
(She hasn't found YUHA and YE-ON.)

403
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,077
(There are only two guesses left,
both used up,)

404
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,579
(so if she's wrong this time,
she fails the mission.)

405
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,980
Did you notice something weird?

406
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,416
What?

407
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,787
(What is weird?)

408
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,222
(They have no clue.)

409
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,991
There are eight tents.

410
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,793
- How many members are there?
- Eight?

411
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:02,695
(Screaming)

412
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,864
There's a tent without a member!

413
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,065
Come again?

414
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,266
Without a member?

415
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,646
- I just got goosebumps.
- I'm out here,

416
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,603
- so why are there eight?
- That's what I'm saying!

417
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,371
Dang!

418
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,440
(The most terrifying horror they ever had)

419
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,908
- Oh, no!
- My gosh.

420
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,076
Hey!

421
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,344
(This is what happened.)

422
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,580
(JIWOO had to find seven members.)

423
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,015
(She found five members.)

424
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,750
(And two members are left.)

425
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,586
(So, who's in the extra tent?)

426
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,355
What? There's one more?

427
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,823
(There's a mole among the members!)

428
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,592
("The unexpected twist surprised us."
- Hearts2Hearts)

429
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,527
Is that the extra tent?

430
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,165
(At the end of the line of tents)

431
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,400
- Let's go.
- Shall we go?

432
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,368
No wonder why they kept saying...

433
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,737
there were eight people
during my interview.

434
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,405
I just thought they were confused.

435
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,673
Wait a minute.

436
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,707
- What is happening?
- So, there's one more?

437
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,277
Gosh, this is on a pretty huge scale.

438
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,379
So, this is how showbiz works.

439
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,214
- No wonder.
- I knew something was off.

440
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,084
(They're finally at the eighth tent.)

441
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,220
(Who's in this tent?)

442
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,690
(Keyword reveal)

443
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:03,456
It says, "FM."

444
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,223
- This one is YE-ON!
- It's YE-ON.

445
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,191
It's absolutely her.

446
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,927
- They're the youngest members.
- The youngest members of each group.

447
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,795
- I think it's her.
- Yes, it's YE-ON.

448
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,330
(Everyone can tell it's YE-ON.)

449
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,966
(It's YE-ON.)

450
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,902
Yes, I think it's YE-ON.

451
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,270
These hands are YE-ON's.

452
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,838
Yes, it's YE-ON.

453
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,907
Then, who's the one in that tent?

454
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,308
Who is hiding in those two?

455
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,011
I think "MVP" and "Corn" were just...

456
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,280
- a red herring.
- That meant nothing?

457
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,149
Then, whose hands are they?

458
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,718
- I don't know.
- Maybe YE-ON took two photos.

459
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,387
What if we're wrong?

460
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,389
- But I'm sure about this one.
- Okay.

461
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,292
(YE-ON,
who's waiting to be called out, was...)

462
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,061
I like the vibe in here.

463
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,263
(She was looking around
inside of the tent.)

464
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,333
(Listening to the sound)

465
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,069
(While they longed for YE-ON
before the fourth tent,)

466
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,138
(YE-ON was frustrated.)

467
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,406
I'm confident as her roommate.

468
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,910
(Are you sure you're my roommate?)

469
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,347
(She waited and waited...)

470
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,450
(and almost turned into a statue.)

471
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,819
I hope they will guess me soon.

472
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,919
(Quietly calling out for them)

473
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:13,458
(She's praying for them to guess wisely.)

474
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,128
What are the keywords for YE-ON?

475
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,996
"Seohyun, NINGNING, Yeri?"

476
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,932
Is it because she's the youngest?

477
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,367
They're so dumb.

478
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,036
So dumb.

479
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:25,937
Geez.

480
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,773
Are they still struggling with the answer?

481
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,274
How can't they see this?

482
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,845
(They're still debating
before the eighth tent.)

483
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,314
- Let's call YE-ON out first.
- Yes.

484
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,649
What if it's not her?

485
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,552
- It has to be her.
- But it could be her.

486
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,053
Why don't we be more careful?

487
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,788
- But I'm sure this one is YE-ON.
- I agree.

488
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,156
This picture...

489
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,925
I took a photo with my hands like this.

490
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,427
I even did this one too.

491
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,131
Some of us took several.

492
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,463
- I made this heart too.
- Me too.

493
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,664
- I took that photo.
- I did too.

494
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,900
I made the same heart.

495
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,933
Maybe it's not?

496
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,035
I think these are my hands.

497
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,937
- No, they're not yours.
- They're definitely not yours.

498
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,307
(YE-ON is getting sad now...)

499
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,610
- From what I think,
- Let's not overthink it.

500
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,111
- we can just call her out.
- Let's call her.

501
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,712
- Let's go ahead.
- Yes, let's do this.

502
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,947
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

503
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,049
- YE-ON, come out!
- YE-ON, come out!

504
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,618
(Escaping instantly)

505
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,020
(Opening without hesitant)

506
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,723
Hey, YE-ON.

507
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,292
You guys took a longer time
than I thought.

508
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,828
- I know.
- We weren't so sure.

509
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,866
(They found six members except for YUHA.)

510
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,969
(Between the second and fourth tents,
which one is YUHA in?)

511
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,372
We're in trouble
with a big question mark in our heads.

512
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:37,377
One of them is YUHA,

513
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,846
- and another is...
- Someone very strange.

514
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,783
- I was listening to you guys inside,
- Yes.

515
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,117
and I thought "Corn" meant Gangwon-do.

516
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,262
She says Gangwon-do is famous for corn.

517
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,923
Then, what is "MVP" for?

518
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,025
YUHA won an MVP at the showcase stage.

519
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,562
(With YE-ON's help,
is YUHA in the second tent?)

520
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,899
But "long hair" and "164cm-tall"
perfectly describe YUHA.

521
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,932
Right.

522
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,200
That's literally her.

523
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,069
(She might be in the fourth tent.)

524
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:05,770
Fools.

525
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,804
(Have you figured it out?)

526
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,808
(We'll let the viewers know first
where YUHA is.)

527
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,309
Why can't they get me right?

528
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,710
(The sad one who hasn't been called...)

529
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,113
(is inside the second tent.)

530
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,781
Wonju is my hometown.

531
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,182
Gangwon-do is famous for corn.

532
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,619
I won an MVP at a dodgeball game.

533
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,055
(She was happily getting ready to leave
when the JI-AN Duo came.)

534
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,392
(They even exchanged telepathy.)

535
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,562
(But they called out STELLA instead.)

536
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,165
(Unexpectedly,
she was forced to stay longer.)

537
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,411
(Her trust in JIWOO was betrayed.)

538
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,238
I'm very disappointed in JIWOO.

539
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,939
I guess the keywords were a bit tricky.

540
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,612
(After JIWOO and IAN left,)

541
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:52,276
(she got more nervous
as the members walked away from her.)

542
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,520
(The tent felt somewhat too spacious.)

543
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,056
They're getting everyone but me.

544
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,025
I can barely hear them now.

545
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,225
They're too far away.

546
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,028
Will I be able to leave here?

547
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,263
(Is there another way out?)

548
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,101
- Let's try the second one.
- This one.

549
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,169
(I believed in you, A-NA!)

550
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,438
Those are definitely YUHA's hands, though.

551
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,339
Let me see.

552
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,708
Let me take a good look at YUHA's hands.

553
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,209
This is her, your lover, right?

554
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,746
(The Meant-To-Be duo)

555
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,580
No, I don't think this is YUHA.

556
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,615
It is me!

557
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,819
Let's check out the fourth one too.

558
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,186
Let's have a look.

559
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,754
(She's left alone again.)

560
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,157
This one is totally YUHA.

561
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,626
But these are not YUHA's hands.

562
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,595
I think the hands at the second tent
belong to YUHA.

563
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,798
They're YUHA's hands?

564
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,234
(After comparing and analyzing,
she's sure it's the second tent.)

565
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:43,801
- Let's go back and see.
- Let's check the second tent.

566
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,803
(Returning to the second tent)

567
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:48,340
(Getting ready as she hears them coming)

568
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,241
This one is YUHA.

569
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,011
(Please get me out of here.)

570
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,545
It's YUHA.

571
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,014
Gangwon-do is known for its corn.

572
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,384
- She's right.
- YUHA is from Gangwon-do.

573
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,385
Wonju, Gangwon-do.

574
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,988
(Nice job, YE-ON.)

575
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,856
Aren't potatoes also famous in Gangwon-do?

576
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,125
They came up with a tricky hint here...

577
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,928
and made the keywords for the fourth tent
somewhat like YUHA.

578
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,263
- Shall we call YUHA out?
- Do you all...

579
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,363
I think it's her.

580
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,698
YUHA is here.

581
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,235
- And those are definitely YUHA's hands.
- Should we decide?

582
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:18,603
And YUHA can't bend her thumb like this.

583
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,904
She's right.

584
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,741
But what if I'm wrong?

585
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,475
I know. What if she's in the fourth one?

586
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:27,355
- I'm sure we're right.
- I agree.

587
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,248
There's just no way
that these hands aren't YUHA's.

588
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,449
- These are YUHA's hands.
- It's obvious.

589
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,151
(The younger members are sure.)

590
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,886
- Should we call her now?
- Let's call her out.

591
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,187
- The height is...
- It's YUHA.

592
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,255
(Trust me, girls.)

593
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,825
In 3, 2, 1!

594
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,425
- YUHA!
- YUHA!

595
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,697
(They loudly call out her name.)

596
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,200
(My love, are you there?)

597
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,103
(She's been stuck inside for a long time.)

598
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,905
(Her tent was rather
at the front of the line,)

599
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:58,376
(so it took a long time
for them to find YUHA.)

600
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,345
Is she coming out?

601
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,547
Please. Come out!

602
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,983
(Cheering)

603
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:09,221
(Finally, YUHA escapes the tent.)

604
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,523
(Greeting her with both arms)

605
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,125
You fools!

606
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,026
How could you guys be so dumb?

607
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,861
(Still, it's a happy ending.)

608
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:19,364
You silly fools.

609
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,233
I thought you were so dumb.

610
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,368
But you were so smart, YE-ON.

611
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,398
(We did it.)

612
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,539
(But, hold on.)

613
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,639
Who's in there?

614
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,675
(Who are you in the fourth tent?)

615
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,378
Let's go check it out.

616
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,980
Who is the 164cm tall person
with a long hair?

617
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,048
- Seriously.
- Who is it?

618
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,183
- Who is inside?
- I'm curious.

619
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,451
I'm a bit scared.

620
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,520
I don't want to see this person.

621
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,189
- I'm too scared to find out.
- I'm scared.

622
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,491
What if she goes like this?

623
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,927
- Let's call her out.
- Ready, go.

624
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,863
- The 164cm tall person with long hair,
- The 164cm tall person with long hair,

625
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,398
- please come out.
- please come out.

626
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,200
Please show yourself.

627
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,111
(We're scared.)

628
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:56,968
Excuse me?

629
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,265
(Three seconds before the reveal)

630
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,305
Excuse me?

631
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,943
(Coming out in a very weird way)

632
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,145
(The one with long hair...)

633
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,580
(was the one who suddenly appeared
on Partner's Day...)

634
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,949
(and became the judge
for hopeless cookies.)

635
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,419
(The SMChelin three-star judge)

636
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,489
(She's here again!)

637
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,595
(Glad)

638
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,194
- Hello.
- Hello.

639
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,459
We met again.

640
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,665
- But you seem taller than 164cm.
- She's right.

641
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,000
(It's the heels.)

642
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,003
(They happily confirmed the fourth tent.)

643
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,906
You guys passed
the first teamwork mission.

644
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,677
(They can retrieve one of the three:
beef, pork, fruit.)

645
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,412
We should choose one of the meat.
Pork or beef.

646
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,080
- Beef.
- Pork or beef.

647
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,316
- The Korean beef.
- Korean beef?

648
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,652
Does everyone prefer beef?

649
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,722
I actually want to eat pork belly.

650
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,090
If we want to keep eating,
pork is a better option.

651
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,593
- I want pork belly.
- I want to eat pork too.

652
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,060
I also want pork belly.

653
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,198
(Their opinions diverge again.)

654
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,764
Let's secure pork first.

655
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,034
- We're getting beef back too.
- Right.

656
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:03,234
(We'll choose beef next time.)

657
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,468
She's right.

658
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,304
Yes, let's get everything back.

659
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,805
We'll have pork back first.

660
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,575
Yum.

661
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,976
(Beef, pork, fruit)

662
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,244
(Pork obtained)

663
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,912
(They got pork for the dinner.)

664
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,313
Thank you.

665
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:18,984
Pork!

666
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:21,086
See you soon.

667
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,988
(Next mission, please.)

668
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,523
(Next episode)

669
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,626
(H2H has teamwork and competitive spirit!)

670
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,294
- This should be so much fun!
- I'm excited.

671
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,331
(Boosting their passion to obtain meat)

672
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:36,668
(Turning up the game skills!)

673
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:38,002
Do you expect us to be scared?

674
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,338
Well, we're not.

675
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,506
(Actually, that was a lie.)

676
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,301
(Error detected.
It's going to be unpredictable.)

677
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,945
(Their bodies aren't keeping up
with their minds.)

678
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,346
(Upset)

679
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,583
We can't have meat if you do that!

680
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,285
(How will H2H's dinnertime turn out?)
