1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,234
(Tell me
about the H2H members' personalities!)

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,005
(Watch this video to find out
each member's personality.)

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,840
- Oh, gosh!
- I'm nervous!

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,709
Look at the tangerines!

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,645
- Tangerines!
- My goodness!

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,014
- Look at the tangerines!
- They look delicious.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,349
I see something written on the board.

8
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,118
What is this?

9
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,786
What does it say?

10
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,390
- "Self PR Pop-Up Open!"
- "Self PR Pop-Up Open!"

11
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,394
- "Promote yourself using the props."
- "Promote yourself using the props."

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,565
(Making individual mini pop-up stores
using various props)

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,134
"How you do
in the tangerine art contest..."

14
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,170
"determines how many props
you can use for the pop-up."

15
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,107
(A tangerine art contest for pop-up props)

16
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,543
(First, make art using tangerine peels.)

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,380
(Second, choose as many props as allowed
according to your ranking.)

18
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,717
Get as many as needed in the basket.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,217
(Harvesting their own tangerines
for the art)

20
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,786
- Take one each.
- Okay.

21
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,421
(Each taking a tangerine basket)

22
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,390
Hello!

23
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,591
Hey!

24
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,396
- There's a keyring inside!
- A keyring!

25
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,997
It's a dol hareubang.

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,399
It's adorable!

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,501
- They're all different!
- No way!

28
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,302
They're all different!

29
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,604
(What are these keyrings for?)

30
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,341
(Those with matching keyrings
will harvest the tangerines together.)

31
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:17,744
Pairs?

32
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,279
(IAN, you!)

33
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,313
Really?

34
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,449
No way!

35
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,017
(Dramatic reactions from everyone)

36
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,952
No way.

37
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:26,986
- How can this be?
- My gosh!

38
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,921
- This is destiny!
- It's destiny!

39
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,091
- We're meant to be!
- Yes, we are!

40
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,359
This is our fate.

41
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,661
- What?
- Is this fate?

42
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,497
- They're the same pairs!
- The same pairs as before!

43
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:39,665
It's meant to be.

44
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,200
Did you plan this?

45
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,937
Really? Unbelievable!

46
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,972
- It's our destiny.
- Destiny!

47
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:47,807
How can it be?

48
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,077
- We're destined to be together!
- It's destiny!

49
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,447
- We aren't the only ones back together.
- I thought we were the only ones.

50
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,782
(But we're still happy!)

51
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,017
- Let's go!
- Off we go!

52
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,019
Off we go to pick the tangerines!

53
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,254
There are so many of them!

54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,222
It's unbelievable!

55
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,725
- Look at the tangerines!
- Tangerines!

56
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,394
The colors are so vibrant!

57
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,730
They're bright orange.

58
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,132
I want to get on this!

59
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,668
Don't you love this?

60
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,604
- Let's pick the tangerines instead.
- And not waste time!

61
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,372
We'll be productive.

62
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,009
(I'm going to pick tangerines
and enjoy the swing.)

63
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,144
(JIWOO, a babysitter
who loves active playtime)

64
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,079
- Is it fun?
- It's the best!

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,380
What's this? How do I ride it?

66
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,183
(CARMEN and STELLA are joining them
at the swings.)

67
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,185
Come here.

68
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,420
We have to pick the tangerines!

69
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,156
- You might crash. Be careful.
- They're going to crash!

70
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,490
JUUN!

71
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,261
- I'll fly to you!
- CARMEN!

72
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,462
(Mom JUUN has
successfully arrested CARMEN.)

73
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,566
- We have to pick tangerines.
- Yes, we do.

74
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,268
Let's pick some tangerines now.

75
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,471
- Hurry. Let's go.
- Okay.

76
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,938
We'll be last at this rate.

77
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,807
We'd better get going
before we place last.

78
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,509
Thank you! Let's go.

79
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,844
(JIWOO's babysitting is over.)

80
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,947
- How are there so many tangerines?
- So pretty!

81
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,950
Doesn't this look
like a Hallabong tangerine?

82
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,986
(I picked a tangerine!)

83
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,187
So big.

84
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,722
(Looking around)

85
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,057
- Let me sneakily eat one.
- Sneakily.

86
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,558
Let's cover ourselves.

87
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,294
(Ditching their basket for secret tasting)

88
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,228
It looks good.

89
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,431
(How do the Jeju tangerines taste?)

90
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,001
It's winter, which means it's...

91
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,402
tangerine season.

92
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,037
(Try some!)

93
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,806
(I can't believe how good it is!)

94
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,274
- I'm dying.
- It's so good!

95
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,142
Unbelievable!

96
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:33,479
I don't know what tangerine art is,

97
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,748
but I want to make an animal.

98
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,218
I'm going to make a project
for someone I love.

99
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,353
The tangerine...

100
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,221
My gosh.

101
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,725
(Sharing love with tangerines)

102
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,093
Hey, IAN!

103
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,962
You can't ditch me, your partner!

104
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,297
There are giant tangerines here!

105
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,200
(Babysitting is all about the stamina.)

106
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,835
The tangerines are bigger here.

107
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,104
I'll just take the whole branch.

108
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,108
- IAN!
- What is this doing here?

109
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,042
This is huge.

110
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,677
I can't reach it.

111
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,179
(Quietly picking it off)

112
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,948
A present for me? Thank you!

113
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,151
I want a big one.

114
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,153
Me too. That'll be better.

115
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,187
Indeed.

116
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,822
(YE-ON is looking for a big tangerine.)

117
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,892
Making art with it will be easier
if the surface area is bigger.

118
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,293
(YE-ON is harvesting a big tangerine.)

119
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,396
The tangerines are huge.

120
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,767
(Harvesting the next one
after showing off for three seconds)

121
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,636
This is legendary!

122
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,837
I'll pick it off.

123
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,372
I only go for the big ones.

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,443
This isn't just a tangerine.
It doesn't look like it.

125
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,245
CARMEN, it's your first time in Jeju.

126
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,646
It's also your first time
picking tangerines, right?

127
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,715
Yes, everything is new to me.

128
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,851
I'm new to everything.

129
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,887
This is adorable.

130
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,857
This is enough for us.

131
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,426
We have enough!

132
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,661
You picked so many tangerines.

133
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,962
- Should we eat some on the way?
- Sure.

134
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,931
Let's go.

135
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,733
- Off we go.
- Come on.

136
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,268
You get ten minutes.

137
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,936
Ready, go!

138
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,938
I only picked four.

139
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,406
Why did you pick so many?

140
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,541
Me? I know, right?

141
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,444
(Quantity over quality)

142
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,845
Aren't mine huge?

143
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,380
They're so big!

144
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,614
This is pretty.

145
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:16,849
Look.

146
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,618
(What is YUHA doing
after getting the pen first?)

147
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,721
(Sketching the draft without hesitation)

148
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,123
What should I do?

149
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,694
- I'll just go for it. Keep going.
- Keep going!

150
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,762
Let's go!

151
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,864
(Sketching away)

152
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,265
I think I can nail it.

153
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,969
(Breaking the peel first)

154
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,304
Good idea!

155
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,840
(Sketching a draft and breaking the peel)

156
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,675
(Undoubtedly a bold type)

157
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,076
Am I a genius?

158
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,247
What should I do?

159
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,748
(The only hesitant one)

160
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,649
A tangerine heart?

161
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,318
What should I do?

162
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,387
(Worrying about her tangerine art)

163
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,856
- I'm terrible at such things.
- So am I.

164
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,692
But what can we do?

165
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,194
Go for it.

166
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,661
Tangerine art.

167
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,697
(Okay, let's try it.)

168
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,266
What does this look like?

169
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,337
Is it a butterfly?

170
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,505
Am I right?

171
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,608
How did you know? Amazing!

172
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,909
Maybe I'm not so bad.

173
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,747
You got it! It's a butterfly.

174
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,418
Maybe three, just in case.

175
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,618
(Talking to herself)

176
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,955
(YE-ON is planning
for her tangerine art project.)

177
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,958
(Looking for the perfect tangerines)

178
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,927
(Running a simulation)

179
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,729
Like this.

180
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,096
I have to be careful.

181
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,732
(Brainstorming for five minutes)

182
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,135
(The older girls aren't taking any time!)

183
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,107
It doesn't look like anything I planned.

184
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,408
This isn't it.

185
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,043
(It's okay. I've failed too.)

186
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,611
(Falling off)

187
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,714
What? What is this?

188
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,915
(Dumbfounded)

189
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,984
Will people recognize what this is?

190
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,386
I'm so good!

191
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,256
Yes!

192
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,994
(A-NA is the only one
satisfied with her work.)

193
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,330
I did so well!

194
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,501
(So cute)

195
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,138
I'm doing an amazing job!

196
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,074
All done! It's cute.

197
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,343
I have to get very artistic.

198
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,011
(Dotting the peel with her artist spirit)

199
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,282
(Slightly intimidated)

200
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,717
Be honest. How is mine?

201
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,253
- It's not bad, is it?
- Yes, you did well.

202
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,689
- Sorry, but you're amazing!
- I did so well!

203
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,223
I bet I'm going to win first place.

204
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,225
- No, I will. I'm serious.
- I mean it.

205
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,227
I'd say JUUN's art is legendary.

206
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,596
Everyone, you better look forward
to JUUN's artwork.

207
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,233
I've never seen anything like it.

208
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,569
(The last push)

209
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,439
(They have 30 more seconds.)

210
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,243
I can't wait to see
what everyone has made.

211
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,246
(Who will win first place?)

212
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,482
(YE-ON, the youngest, is going first.)

213
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,351
(I'm excited.)

214
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,186
- So cute!
- Do you see it?

215
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,187
- Yes!
- Yes, we do!

216
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,989
- You did well!
- That's adorable!

217
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,224
It's called "Nature."

218
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,659
("Nature" by YE-ON)

219
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,894
The bear is the highlight.

220
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,664
I even made its stem.

221
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,634
It's a lucky four-leaf clover.

222
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,369
(Even adding a stem for detail)

223
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,172
- I thought about Jeju and animals.
- Good one!

224
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,005
You did well.

225
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,508
Next is JUUN.

226
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,643
Here it is.

227
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,811
(This is my artwork.)

228
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,646
This is my art.

229
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,550
(Everyone is in awe.)

230
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,886
- What?
- It looks so cool!

231
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,019
Yes, it does!

232
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,955
This is a cheetah and the sun.

233
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,193
The sun represents my dream.

234
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:49,829
You're a total artist!

235
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,129
It's so artistic.

236
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,600
As you know, cheetahs are
the fastest animals in the world.

237
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,501
- Yes.
- Right.

238
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,270
The message is, "I'll run
to my dream as fast as a cheetah."

239
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,206
(Title: "I'm on 'The Chase' for my dream")

240
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,074
That's incredible.

241
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,510
- It's inspiring!
- Great job!

242
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,012
I love what your art means.

243
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:06,979
Really?

244
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,380
(Excited to hear YE-ON's compliments)

245
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,681
Great work!

246
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,817
(JUUN wasn't so bad.)

247
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,486
I feel so much pressure now.

248
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,758
This is a monkey.

249
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,629
(A monkey?)

250
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,032
(Oh, wow! It's a monkey!)

251
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,835
(Please believe I'm a monkey.)

252
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:29,802
A monkey?

253
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,436
(Why are they laughing?)

254
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,640
Why are you laughing so much?

255
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,808
You did so well!

256
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,445
(The monkey has escaped.)

257
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,881
(Even monkeys fall
from the tree sometimes.)

258
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,751
(The artist is shocked.)

259
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,353
(The monkey is monkeying around!)

260
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:49,855
Monkey!

261
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,457
Hold on! Let me save it first.

262
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,559
(Conducting CPR)

263
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,228
- This is hilarious!
- Hey!

264
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,365
- Monkey!
- Monkey!

265
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,333
Oh, no!

266
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,267
(In a coma)

267
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,169
- We have to pin it.
- You dummy!

268
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,370
(Coming back to life with pins)

269
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,339
(JUUN, the miraculous doctor)

270
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,308
- All done.
- You pinned its head!

271
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,510
It's okay.

272
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,045
- I feel so bad.
- This is art.

273
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,647
Why is it missing a leg?

274
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,551
It's not missing a leg.

275
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,885
This is the tail.

276
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,120
This is the tail.

277
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,890
(Nobody thought it was a tail.)

278
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,392
(Please believe me. I'm a tail.)

279
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,327
It's a monkey sitting down.

280
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,330
(In awe)

281
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:34,500
It's too straight. Hold on.

282
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,268
It's supposed to be...

283
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,103
like this.

284
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,606
(Crying in laughter)

285
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,108
I'll explain the artwork.

286
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,711
The monkey represents me,

287
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,913
and this resembles YUHA.

288
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:49,381
She...

289
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,017
(We don't need a couple here!)

290
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,852
has a special place in my heart.

291
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,622
(A stubborn lover)

292
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,692
I made YUHA and me.

293
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,394
The tangerine represents...

294
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,363
our memory of tangerine picking
in Jeju today.

295
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,598
That's my art.

296
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,232
Great job!

297
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,366
(Title: "Jeju, Tangerines, and YUHA")

298
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,302
She's getting ready!

299
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,237
What are you doing?

300
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,608
(Getting ready for a dopamine rush)

301
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,744
("The Tangerine Code: Dr. IAN on Call")

302
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,248
(This is the front line for art.
I must save this tangerine art.)

303
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,550
Let's start in earnest.

304
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,884
(Dr. IAN's briefing begins now.)

305
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,087
Ta-da!

306
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,955
(Operation Frog by Dr. IAN)

307
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,757
(The tangerine art operation was
a huge success!)

308
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,560
It's called "Gratitude."

309
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,997
The frog looks very extravagant.

310
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,232
It's not just any frog.

311
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,935
It's wearing lots of mascara.

312
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,305
Before a frog becomes this fancy,

313
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,241
it must endure its days...

314
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,744
as an egg and a tadpole.

315
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,180
(It's a story about its life!)

316
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,416
This is to say I won't forget...

317
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,586
my egg and tadpole days...

318
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:03,934
even after becoming a fancy frog,
don't forget to be grateful.

319
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:07,565
That's my life principle,

320
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:10,101
and I expressed it through this art piece.

321
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,936
(That was a good one.)

322
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,004
Well done.

323
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,083
Thank you.

324
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,673
(Frog-IAN never forgets
that she was once a tadpole.)

325
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,469
Ta-da.

326
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,577
(It's time to unveil
YUHA's tangerine artwork.)

327
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,881
My piece is about Christmas.

328
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:23,116
(A snowy white Christmas)

329
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,684
First, this is a snowman.

330
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:29,855
Here's the Christmas tree,
and this is Santa's hat.

331
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:31,425
I have a question.

332
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:34,159
Who is the heart shape for?

333
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,431
(Is that heart for me?)

334
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,032
(Shy)

335
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,634
(You and I are destined.)

336
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:44,336
(Here she goes again.)

337
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,272
This heart...

338
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,173
doesn't really mean anything.

339
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,443
(It's still one-sided.)

340
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:51,911
I guess that's it for us.

341
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:53,403
(They'll be lovey-dovey soon.)

342
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:54,681
(Pouting)

343
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,950
- Next up is STELLA.
- Geez.

344
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,317
(Here comes the gorgeous girl!)

345
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:02,564
What do you think I made here?

346
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:03,856
- Shooting stars!
- Shooting Stars.

347
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:04,623
That's right.

348
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,127
The title of my piece is "Wish."

349
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:09,128
You make a wish
upon a shooting star, right?

350
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,263
There were supposed to be all eight of us,

351
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,533
but I ran out of time
and couldn't make eight.

352
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,835
I hope you can imagine there are eight.

353
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,896
Okay. We got it.

354
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,641
It's us making a wish together.

355
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,077
(Please grant our wishes!)

356
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,313
That's awesome.

357
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:29,148
The shooting stars turned out really well.

358
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,785
Yours has so many on the surface.

359
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:34,887
It looks glamorous.

360
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,823
(Grand reveal of CARMEN's piece)

361
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,029
I bet all our members recognize this.

362
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,063
You remember who this is, right?

363
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,898
- It's Anxiety.
- Anxiety.

364
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,934
The title of my piece is "Anxiety."

365
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:52,838
It's a character I created myself.

366
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,273
Do you know why I made Anxiety?

367
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:57,977
Because Anxiety is here
to take all our worries away.

368
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,745
That's so cool.

369
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:00,846
How sweet.

370
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:03,682
I feel pressure being the last one.

371
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,184
Let's go!

372
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:06,552
JIWOO!

373
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,020
- Let's go, JIWOO!
- You got this!

374
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:11,057
- Ta-da.
- So cute!

375
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:15,861
There are 4 butterflies and 4 flowers.

376
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:20,199
As you know, butterflies
and flowers help each other to live.

377
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,967
(You don't say!)

378
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,237
I think that's just like our team.

379
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:25,638
(H2H works together
like butterflies and flowers.)

380
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,340
This heart sign is a symbol of our love.

381
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:29,842
(It's for all of you.)

382
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,011
You know what I mean, right?

383
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:33,713
- Yes.
- I love you.

384
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:34,747
- How nice.
- That's so meaningful.

385
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,883
Well done.

386
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:37,416
Everyone did such a great job.

387
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,386
It's going to be really hard
to pick a winner.

388
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:41,220
- I know.
- Right.

389
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,935
Let's take a vote right away.

390
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:44,023
- Okay.
- All right.

391
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,789
(Show of hands! Pick your two
favorite works, including your own!)

392
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:52,197
(Tension rises,
just like during the "Mafia Game" night.)

393
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,834
(Which tangerine artwork
will capture everyone's heart?)

394
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:56,969
- We got the result.
- Okay.

395
00:14:57,404 --> 00:14:58,604
(Curious)

396
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,039
Who's the winner?

397
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,709
The one who placed eighth is very modest.

398
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:05,378
She didn't even vote for herself.

399
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:06,378
Oh, boy.

400
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,481
- She is very honest.
- She really is.

401
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,482
YE-ON.

402
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:11,384
(The honest and modest YE-ON)

403
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:13,553
- It's okay.
- It's all fine.

404
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,289
- You're so honest.
- How kind.

405
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,524
- Meanwhile, the rest of us...
- We are selfish.

406
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:19,959
Next, fifth place.

407
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,160
(Who are those placed in fifth?)

408
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:23,596
IAN, YUHA, and CARMEN.

409
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:26,000
(That's not bad at all.)

410
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,232
You each got one vote.

411
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,135
Wait. So we all just voted for ourselves?

412
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:34,164
(It turns out it was self-voting!)

413
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:36,175
(They got one vote from themselves.)

414
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,009
Oh, my.

415
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,712
(Oh, guys...)

416
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:40,846
Third place.

417
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:42,114
(Let's reveal who placed third.)

418
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,150
A-NA and STELLA got two votes each.

419
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,052
(A-NA and STELLA, third place!)

420
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,354
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

421
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:49,789
- Who voted for me?
- I did.

422
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,491
I'm so touched.

423
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:55,194
Now, time for first and second place.
It was super nip and tuck.

424
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,596
(Two finalists)

425
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,465
(Who will become H2H's handcraft queen?)

426
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,467
Just one vote made the difference.

427
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,369
- A single vote?
- Only one vote?

428
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,637
(The winner received a single more vote.)

429
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,273
The winner is JUUN, who got five votes.

430
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:08,708
(The winner won by just one extra vote.)

431
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,043
(Lovely tofu JUUN celebrates
with a cute pose!)

432
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,311
Thank you!

433
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,313
And the runner-up is JIWOO,
with four votes.

434
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:15,781
(JIWOO takes second place!)

435
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:17,483
- Congrats!
- Congrats!

436
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:19,585
Congratulations!

437
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:22,554
(It's time to make a self-promotion board
with all sorts of decorative items!)

438
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,995
(JUUN gets unlimited time
to pick her items.)

439
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:31,030
(Three rhinestone stickers
and glitter stickers)

440
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,932
(The VIP customer is now unstoppable.)

441
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:34,834
That's enough.

442
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,769
I'll take these too, just in case.

443
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:38,648
- That's too much.
- She took everything.

444
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:39,372
- I'm done.

445
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,106
This is pretty.

446
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,174
Just take it anyway.

447
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:44,410
(They're shopping in a trance.)

448
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,379
(Once they're done choosing,
they start making their board.)

449
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:47,713
Why did I even grab this?

450
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:49,915
Why did you?

451
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:51,884
- I'm so good at it.
- Let me see.

452
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,785
You're doing great.

453
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:54,020
(The VIP customer has already
started making a flashy board.)

454
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,555
This is me.

455
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,991
You're really good at this.

456
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:00,159
Thank you.

457
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,460
I wasn't talking to you.

458
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,163
"Thank you!"

459
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,764
How do I use this?

460
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:07,366
(IAN struggles right from the start.)

461
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,334
Why did you grab that?

462
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:10,536
I just grabbed whatever.

463
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,306
(Rustling)

464
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:15,941
(Messy)

465
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:17,110
It's out of control.

466
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:19,445
Oh, my.

467
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,080
Oh, boy.

468
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,248
- Come on!
- Are you okay?

469
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,649
I'm okay.

470
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,650
Ta-da.

471
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,253
(Is this a kindergarten?)

472
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,953
It's taking me forever.

473
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,588
Seriously.

474
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,689
(In the middle of all this chaos,
she is totally focused on her work.)

475
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,658
It's so messy!

476
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,159
(All the noise seems to fade away.)

477
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,796
It's tangled. I'm in trouble.

478
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,163
You're good.

479
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,665
It looks like an art piece
already, doesn't it?

480
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,101
It's already perfect.

481
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,505
Look how flashy JUUN's board is.

482
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,776
(She went all out with the stickers.)

483
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:51,710
She's amazing!

484
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,312
Thank you.

485
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:54,379
Thank you.

486
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,782
Can I use this, please?

487
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:57,950
Of course, go ahead.

488
00:17:57,975 --> 00:17:59,676
Thank you.

489
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,354
You should amuse her for it.

490
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,355
Of course. Nothing is free.

491
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,124
You didn't think I'd just give it
to you for free, did you?

492
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:07,326
Thanks for letting me use it.

493
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:10,396
- She's so good!
- It was so cute!

494
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,431
(Proud)

495
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:17,102
(H2H's Pop-up Store is now open!)

496
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:25,378
Let me introduce IAN to you.

497
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:27,747
(How bold!)

498
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:30,482
Since I have long hair,

499
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,428
I used paper streamers to express my hair.

500
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,789
And when you open it up,

501
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,524
here it is.

502
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:39,826
(Her face, which was hidden, is revealed.)

503
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,828
Because I love stars,

504
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,364
I drew some stars myself.

505
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,099
They also show...

506
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,668
my determination to be a star.

507
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,136
- And...
- Geez.

508
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:54,440
I attached my picture with a tangerine.

509
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,142
It also says my MBTI type, ENFP,

510
00:18:57,143 --> 00:19:00,413
which says a lot about me.

511
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:02,681
And lastly, because I love myself,

512
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,152
I wrote that I love me.

513
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:08,020
(Everyone's busy working
on their own boards.)

514
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,355
It was amazing.

515
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:12,925
Please show lots of love
for my board and me, IAN!

516
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:14,793
(IAN's Pop-up Store is now closed.)

517
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:15,961
Thank you.

518
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,335
Let me introduce my piece.

519
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:26,037
For starter...

520
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:29,108
(Her board starts to fall apart
before she even starts.)

521
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,910
First...

522
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,177
(Another adhesive issue)

523
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,212
Let me tell you about myself.

524
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:35,947
My name is A-NA.

525
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,183
Here's my photo.

526
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:41,520
I drew a duck and a monkey
that looked like me.

527
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,654
It's falling off again.

528
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,356
- Just ignore them.
- It's falling.

529
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:46,325
These pom-poms.

530
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,061
They're surrounding me.

531
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,464
They represent our loving
and supporting fans.

532
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,900
Here's my autograph.

533
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,203
Please show lots of love
for my board and me.

534
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,942
Now, let me introduce JIWOO to you.

535
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,779
(JIWOO's Pop-up Store is now open!)

536
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:09,748
Since green is my favorite color,

537
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,886
I decorated the top with green ribbon.

538
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,955
(They're too busy with their own boards
to look at her work.)

539
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,091
(Excuse me?)

540
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,569
(They shout out...)

541
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:22,661
(but back to work immediately.)

542
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:23,796
Pay attention.

543
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,131
- Okay.
- Yes.

544
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,601
My favorite flower is lilac,

545
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,970
so I added lilac stickers.

546
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:34,973
I also love the vintage aesthetic,

547
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,511
so I added some vintage touches.

548
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:41,280
I like it.

549
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,182
You're not listening, are you?

550
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:44,283
- Yes!
- We're listening!

551
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,618
- I love it.
- It's amazing.

552
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:49,054
- Please go on.
- Impressive.

553
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:51,156
And finally,
the string lights represent...

554
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:54,359
how I'll light up the world
with my brightness!

555
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:56,729
(Bright JIWOO)

556
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:59,932
I'm going to shine for everyone.

557
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,334
(JIWOO's Pop-up Store is now closed.)

558
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:09,174
Ta-da.

559
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,679
My favorite color is pink,

560
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,014
so my main palette is pink.

561
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:19,484
I added cat stickers
because cats are my favorite animals.

562
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:22,387
And here's a rabbit,
which is another one of my favorites.

563
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:23,989
(So cute)

564
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:26,015
And over here, a duck...

565
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:27,526
That's A-NA!

566
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,329
Finally.

567
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:32,364
- What was that?
- Thank you.

568
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,266
(It wraps up with a Meant-To-Be moment.)

569
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:40,172
I'm a huge fan of pink,

570
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,640
so my whole palette is pink.

571
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:42,808
(Her color analysis result: pink!)

572
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,311
Here's my MBTI type, ENTP.

573
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,946
Another word to describe me is dessert...

574
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:50,149
because I love candies,
chocolates, and everything sweet.

575
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,826
I also love playing guitar and drums,

576
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:54,763
listening to music,

577
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:56,122
and cats!

578
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,557
That's all about me.

579
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,560
(STELLA fills her board
with her favorite things.)

580
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:09,134
Here's my MBTI type, INFP.

581
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:11,305
(MBTI type is a must on the board!)

582
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:13,505
Here's my photo. Aren't I cute?

583
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,806
(CARMEN's first Jeju)

584
00:22:14,874 --> 00:22:17,108
Pink is my favorite color,

585
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:18,677
so I decorated the board all in pink.

586
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:20,712
- All pink.
- We all love pink!

587
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:23,248
I love cats,

588
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:25,584
so I put a cat sticker here.

589
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,378
And my mo...

590
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,557
What's the word?

591
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,525
- Motto.
- Motto.

592
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:35,494
My motto is "Trust yourself."

593
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:37,363
Thank you.

594
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:39,764
(CARMEN's cute pop-up store is
now closed.)

595
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:45,004
First, I'd like to tell you...

596
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:47,572
about this ribbon here.

597
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,942
I put it on to make it
look like a gift box...

598
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:52,611
because I want to be
like a gift to everyone.

599
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:55,981
That's why this ribbon is here.

600
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,318
My favorite color is yellow,

601
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,153
so I added yellow touches here and there.

602
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:04,930
And here's my autograph.

603
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,592
It says ON, like switch on.

604
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,094
I want to be the light for everyone.

605
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:09,528
(Let YE-ON be your light!)

606
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:10,963
Let me turn the light on for you.

607
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:12,665
Since I placed last,

608
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:14,700
I ended up
with the least decorative materials.

609
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:16,511
So, I drew some confetti myself.

610
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,069
(What's in the gift box?
Her hand-drawn confetti!)

611
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:21,339
- Well done!
- Good job!

612
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,714
As you can see, there's a cat on my board.

613
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,252
People say I look like a cat,

614
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:36,188
so I made the silhouette of a cat.

615
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,757
Just like a cat, I might seem cold...

616
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:40,826
and icy at first,

617
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:42,928
but as you get to know me,

618
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:47,366
you'll see I'm a girl with a warm,
soft heart inside.

619
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:48,700
(Cheering for the Cat JUUN)

620
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,836
- That's what I wanted to show you.
- She's good.

621
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:51,971
(She's a true handcraft queen.)

622
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,806
Thank you!

623
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,309
- So cute!
- It's super cute!

624
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,333
