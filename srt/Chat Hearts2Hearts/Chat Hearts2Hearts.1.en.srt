00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:17,793
Hello!

2
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:19,460
Welcome.

3
00:00:27,413 --> 00:00:29,013
What can I help with?

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,606
Hello.

5
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:31,906
(Tell me more about YUHA.)

6
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:33,958
(YUHA, an H2H member,
born on April 12, 2007.)

7
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:34,825
(Do you want more details?)

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,040
Listen up.

9
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:38,973
Hello!

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,140
I'm YUHA.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,806
I was born on April 12, 2007.

12
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:47,306
My MBTI type is INTJ.

13
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:50,806
I'm like a strawberry in a cream cake,

14
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:52,940
meaning everyone needs me.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,073
(So sweet)

16
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:58,273
I love playing the piano.

17
00:00:58,673 --> 00:01:00,573
I started playing it when I was six,

18
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,473
so I've been playing it
for a very long time.

19
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:05,240
I participated in piano competitions
every year...

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,406
from the first grade until middle school.

21
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:09,173
And I won first place every time.

22
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,806
I'll play it for you someday.

23
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,406
I love hanging out with my teammates.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,806
I laugh nonstop...

25
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:18,806
when I'm with my friends.

26
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:20,106
I laugh really easily.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,406
(Laughing every day around her teammates)

28
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,773
Dumplings?

29
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:25,331
- Galbi dumplings?
- Kimchi dumplings?

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,006
(Giggling at every little joke)

31
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,273
(How will Ms. Giggles be like
on a reality show?)

32
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,306
You're so good!

33
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:34,473
How did you know?

34
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:37,140
(Laughing uncontrollably)

35
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,506
(Stay tuned for happy YUHA
with the most dramatic reactions!)

36
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,740
I think...

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,006
A-NA is the funniest teammate.

38
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,106
She makes me laugh without even trying.

39
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,700
I laugh at her jokes the most.

40
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:52,540
We have amazing teamwork.

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,806
- Who picked me?
- Me, of course.

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,573
I'm so touched!

43
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,740
(Endless flirting)

44
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:03,373
(They're always in their own world.)

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,773
(Sharing love,
even through tangerine slices)

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,673
(Your love makes me dizzy!)

47
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,240
- We're meant to be!
- We're meant to be!

48
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,273
(May A-NA and YUHA's friendship
last forever.)

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,373
I know I don't show it often,

50
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:19,006
but I really love you.

51
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,306
You're totally my type.

52
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,073
(YUHA)

53
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:24,935
(Where it all began)

54
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,206
I was always very energetic,

55
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:31,940
so I loved to watch people perform,

56
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,606
dance, and sing.

57
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,573
That was what made me
want to become a singer.

58
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,006
(How did you join SM Entertainment?)

59
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,640
On my way home from school,

60
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,873
someone asked me,
"Do you know Red Velvet?"

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,806
Then, they explained
that they worked for SM...

62
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:50,640
and wanted to offer me an audition.

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,073
I took their name card
and gave them my number.

64
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,040
My mom scolded me for this.

65
00:02:57,106 --> 00:03:01,173
At first, my mom was a bit against it,

66
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:03,540
but I wanted to see what it'd be like...

67
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,506
and what I could learn there.

68
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:08,373
So, I kept convincing my mom,

69
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:10,606
and she eventually started
supporting my dream.

70
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:13,340
(The trainee life)

71
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:15,940
I had fun dancing and singing...

72
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,606
since I started training.

73
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,406
Everything was fun to me.

74
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,073
When I first started learning things,

75
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:23,840
I struggled with some things, of course,

76
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,106
but I still have fun practicing,
even to this day.

77
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,306
I like to practice alone,
thinking about how I can be better.

78
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,340
I guess I'm the type
that tries hard in silence.

79
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:34,240
(What was the most memorable moment?)

80
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,306
I was in several showcases as a trainee,

81
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:40,306
and I felt so happy and proud...

82
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:42,606
when I won first place.

83
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,673
That was a huge motivation for me.

84
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,006
It pushed me to be better.

85
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,473
(Full of laughter)

86
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:52,473
(Great teamwork)

87
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:53,306
(Lovely)

88
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,506
(Tell me about A-NA.)

89
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,530
(A-NA, an H2H member,
born on December 20, 2008.)

90
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,731
(Do you want more details?)

91
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:05,673
Hello, I'm A-NA.

92
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:06,806
Hello!

93
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,006
"A-NA" stands...

94
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,273
for "I'll ace everything."

95
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,240
My MBTI type is INFJ...

96
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,706
with a strong feeler tendency.

97
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:19,940
My best trait is...

98
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,473
that I have so many layers of charms,
like an onion.

99
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:26,906
I'd say that I have about 82 layers now.

100
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:30,606
"Ay! Don't do that!"

101
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:32,340
"No, you can't look at anyone else."

102
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,731
"A-NA is the only one you can look at!"

103
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:36,606
Thank you.

104
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,940
(What's your favorite thing?)

105
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:42,673
I love watching horror or mystery movies.

106
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,140
The suspect is you,

107
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,806
tangerine!

108
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:48,440
(Horror?)

109
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,706
No, I'm not scared.

110
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,440
(Never mind. I'm scared.)

111
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:55,773
I don't know how I'm going to change.

112
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,173
(But she's still okay.)

113
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,006
(No, I'm not!)

114
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,140
I get it! Sorry!

115
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,373
(Stay tuned for the scared onion
who loves anything horror.)

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,306
My special talent is making people laugh.

117
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,340
I'm pretty funny.

118
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:14,640
(Giving a shoutout to herself)

119
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,273
(Wherever A-NA is,)

120
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,473
(the laughter spirit comes.)

121
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:22,006
She's hilarious.

122
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:25,273
I laugh a lot, thanks to her.

123
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:28,073
A-NA must've been born funny.

124
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:29,340
Are you guys going to have any?

125
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:30,673
No.

126
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:32,840
- Are we getting mangoes?
- Wait!

127
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,306
Wait!

128
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:37,306
(A comedy treasure is born in 2025.)

129
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,540
I feel loved...

130
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:42,506
when people tell me that I'm funny.

131
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,106
(Where it all began)

132
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,940
I used to dance and sing...

133
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,206
all the time at home ever since a kid,

134
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:55,406
so my parents signed me up
for proper lessons.

135
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:57,740
And I naturally started thinking...

136
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,240
that this had to be my career path.

137
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,840
(How did you join SM Entertainment?)

138
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,006
There was an audition
for SM Entertainment at my dance school,

139
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,640
so I was determined to give my best.

140
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:11,773
I thought I'd been rejected,
but on the next day,

141
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,506
(She got a call
the day after the audition.)

142
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,506
I was told I was accepted.

143
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,440
It the happy moment I can never forget.

144
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:19,940
(The trainee life)

145
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,240
I debuted after three years of training.

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,273
I'm a hard worker.

147
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:28,340
I've been practicing...

148
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,740
with a focus on showcasing my best traits.

149
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,840
I was complimented
at my first monthly evaluation.

150
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:38,340
I felt incredibly proud.

151
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,440
Until then, I wasn't sure
if I could do well there,

152
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,173
but that moment gave me faith
that I'd do well.

153
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:46,940
It got me more focused on my goal...

154
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,140
until this point.

155
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:51,573
(A reality show gem)

156
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,873
(A sensitive onion)

157

(A mystery enthusiast)

158
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:55,506
(Tell me about JIWOO.)

159
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:56,673
Hello!

160
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:58,040
I'm JIWOO.

161
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:02,073
I was born in Seoul on September 7, 2006.

162
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,106
My personality type is ISTJ.

163
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,606
I love...

164
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:08,740
traveling more than anything.

165
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,240
I also love watching animations.

166
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:16,206
"Just you watching this right now!"

167
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:18,140
"Would you be my friend?"

168

(JIWOO's character)

170
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,273
I'm a natural leader,
like a class president.

171
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:29,006
Even when I'm with my teammates,

172
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:31,406
I'm the one to lead the group
through situations...

173
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,306
where we must make decisions.

174
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:35,706
I have good leadership skills.

175
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,873
Let's all start with the crop move.

176
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:41,406
- Can we start the music sooner?
- Sooner?

Stay safe.

181

184
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,373
The wind may be strong,

185
00:07:57,773 --> 00:07:58,773
but we're fine!

186
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:01,473
This is what dreams are made of.

187
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:02,606
(Leader Duty Three: Mental conditioning)

188
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:04,473
(The perfect leader we can trust)

189
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,606
She's always so attentive
and taking good care of us.

190
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:09,806
She always watches out for me.

191
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,040
She's so reliable.

192
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,673
Thank you, and I love you.

193
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:17,873
Thank you for trusting and following me.

194
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,440
Remember that I always love you!

195
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,773
Let's give it our all!

196
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:24,306
(Where it all began)

197
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:31,173
An SM Entertainment employee invited me
to an audition on the streets.

198
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:33,240
Isn't that impressive?

199
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,040
It was 2018,

200
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,206
and I was at a convenience store
with my friends.

201
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:43,773
The employee at the checkout...

202
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,340
couldn't stop looking at me.

203
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,673
Then, they asked me for my school,
division, and name.

204
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:57,373
I was young and naive,
so I told her everything.

205
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,773
She turned out to be
my current manager's friend.

206
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,106
That was how I got invited
to join the agency.

207
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:07,306
(The trainee life)

208
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:10,606
I debuted
after about six years of training.

209
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,806
I started training in sixth grade
at the age of 13.

210
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,740
I grew up doing ballet from a young age,

211
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,906
so I was always into dancing,

212
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:24,073
but I knew nothing
about dancing to pop music.

213
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,606
I still remember getting so fascinated...

214
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:29,906
on my first day as a trainee.

215
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,706
It felt awkward,

216
00:09:31,706 --> 00:09:33,740
but I had fun from day one.

217
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:38,073
Doing things for the first time...

218
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,573
kept me happy throughout the years.

219
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,840
I had a long way to go,

220
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,673
but I became more interested
in this line of work...

221
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,640
as I started learning things one by one.

222
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,573
I can confidently tell you
that my hard work has gotten me here.

223
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,906
(Born a leader)

224
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:55,040
(An attentive planner)

225
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,406
(Go-getter)

226
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,073
(Tell me about CARMEN.)

227
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,726
(CARMEN, an H2H member,
born on March 28, 2006.)

228
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,960
(Do you want more details?)

229
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,506
Hello, everyone!

230
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,773
I'm CARMEN.

231
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm from Bali, Indonesia.

232
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,006
Hello, everyone!

233
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:19,873
I'm from Bali, Indonesia.

234
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,040
I love to sing,

235
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,840
play the piano, and bake.

236
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:29,106
My MBTI type is INFP.

237
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,873
I'm very dramatic with my reactions.

238
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:35,406
I'm happy 24 hours a day,
and I smile nonstop.

239
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:40,473
(A sunny girl filled
with optimistic energy)

240
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,306
So sweet!

241
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,733
(Even her reactions are overly happy.)

242
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:46,606
(It's okay,
even if something sad happens.)

243
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:48,640
(Always doing her best)

244
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,106
I can do it!

245
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:52,673
(The sunniest girl ever)

246
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,906
She's like a ray of sun.

247
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:57,573
She always shares positive energy with us.

248
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,006
She gives me bright energy.

249
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:03,373
(Every day is a sunny day
for the sunny girl.)

250
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,340
Be as happy as me!

251
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:10,073
(Optimistic energy shooting
through the screen)

252
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,940
"Hey, you, watching the camera!"

253
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,740
"Do you know who I am?"

254
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:16,906
"I'm CARMEN."

255
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,306
"Please give me lots of love!"

256
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,572
(Where it all began)

257
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:30,406
I always wanted to become a singer...

258
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:34,706
because my parents were musicians.

259
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:37,440
Then, watched
the K-pop singers' performances,

260
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,206
and I found them so fascinating...

261
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:43,873
as they sang and danced at the same time.

262
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:47,173
I knew that I had to become one.

263
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,306
I auditioned without much expectation,

264
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:52,673
but got accepted.

265
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm so thankful.

266
00:11:56,273 --> 00:12:00,673
I think I was meant to join the agency.

267
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,240
(What song did you sing at the audition?)

268
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,673
I sang several songs...

269
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:08,706
like "When This Rain Stops"
and "Like Water."

270
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:10,540
I also sang "Fine" by Taeyeon,

271
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,873
"Reflection," "I Have Nothing," "Listen,"

272
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:15,073
and "Into the New World."

273
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,206
(The songs that got her accepted)

274
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:19,973
(The trainee life)

275
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,706
It was tough...

276
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,906
when I first joined as a trainee.

277
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,840
Everyone else was at this level...

278
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,240
while I was down here.

279
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,540
It was hard to catch up with them.

280
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,440
I wasn't from Korea...

281
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,706
and couldn't speak any Korean,

282
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:42,740
so I couldn't talk to anyone,

283
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,706
even when I wanted to make friends.
I felt so lonely.

284
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:49,940
I just focused on giving it my all.

285
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,606
I always practice alone...

286
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,673
and do my best.

287
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:56,606
I'm a hard worker.

288
00:12:57,973 --> 00:13:00,173
(How did you study Korean?)

289
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:02,940
My agency gave me Korean lessons...

290
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,940
about three times a week.

291
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,373
Those have been so helpful.

292
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,540
I worked hard, and look where I am now!

293
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,006
I'm always grateful for my teammates.

294
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,806
(Whenever she doesn't recognize a word,)

295
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:22,873
(the girls quickly help her out.)

296
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,573
(Whenever she looks for help,)

297
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,473
- Motto.
- Motto!

298
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,006
(the girls are there to help her
with difficult words.)

299
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,906
- Hometown.
- Hometown.

300
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,238
I'm so thankful for them.

301
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:36,440
I love you!

302
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,106
I hope I can keep improving.

303
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:40,906
I am...

304
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:44,040
going to try harder.

305
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:47,006
(A girl from Bali)

306
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,206
(A ray of sunshine)

307
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,431
(A tireless hard worker)

308
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,640
(Tell me about STELLA.)

309
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,492
(STELLA, an H2H member,
born on June 18, 2007)

310
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:56,826
(Do you want more details?)

311
00:13:58,098 --> 00:13:59,965
Hi, I'm STELLA.

312
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,206
Hi, everyone. I'm STELLA.

313
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:07,440
I'm from Vancouver, Canada.

314
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,440
My MBTI personality type is ENTP.

315
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,173
I enjoy playing the guitar and the drums.

316
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:17,673
I also love skiing and eating dessert.

317
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,648
I enjoy all kinds of desserts,

318
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,206
but if I had to pick just one,

319
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:23,806
it would be cake.

320
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,406
I'm obsessed with cheesecake.

321
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:30,840
I'm always smiley and chatty.

322
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:34,173
(She has fun even while waiting her turn)

323
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,373
IAN and I are the extroverts on the team,

324
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:42,906
and we love bringing energy
and lifting everyone's spirits.

325
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:45,973
Everyone, welcome back
to Hot Girl News today.

326
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:47,706
We have IAN.

327
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:49,206
Can you tell us why you are here today?

328
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,106
Because...

329
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,173
of filming.

330
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:54,806
This ASMR is just for you.

331
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,073
(The ASMR object: IAN's skin)

332
00:14:58,573 --> 00:14:59,973
Can you hear the sound?

333
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:02,406
Whenever I'm with her,

334
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:04,540
I have so much fun. She's hilarious.

335
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:08,548
She was like a hot Canadian girl.

336
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,340
(STELLA is a hot girl
with a cheerful personality.)

337
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,106
(Being cute is just a bonus.)

338
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:17,940
(She's naturally gorgeous too.)

339
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,940
- My English has gotten rusty.
- Are you serious?

340
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,813
I'm going for the sheep fashion today.

341
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,540
(Her quirky charm can
even attract a horse.)

342
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,840
If I had to describe myself
in one sentence,

343
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,840
I'd say I'm like a cat with many charms.

344
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:37,740
"Stop!"

345
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,240
"Who is that girl on TV,
glowing so brightly?"

346
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,240
"That's me!"

347
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:46,173
(Where it all began)

348
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:51,206
When I was in kindergarten,

349
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:54,540
I went on stage for a talent show
before our parents.

350
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:58,406
I felt such joy being on stage...

351
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:01,340
that I started dreaming
of becoming a performer.

352
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:04,006
(How did you join SM Entertainment?)

353
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:07,940
After the COVID pandemic,

354
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,240
I moved back to Korea.

355
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,073
Soon, I began taking dance classes.

356
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,373
That's where I first heard
about the SM audition.

357
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:17,899
I wasn't sure if I could become a singer,

358
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,006
but I decided to give it a shot.

359
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:22,073
I remember crying...

360
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:24,473
when I got the acceptance call.

361
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,973
(The trainee life)

362
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:29,606
I trained for about a year and a half.

363
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:32,081
As a trainee,

364
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:34,573
I struggled
with frustration and disappointment...

365
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:38,473
whenever I had trouble
with dancing or singing.

366
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:42,706
But each time, I worked hard to improve.

367
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:45,006
While doing various group tasks,

368
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,973
I became more and more ambitious.

369
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:53,515
Since then,
I've regained my self-confidence,

370
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,673
and I still try hard to think positively.

371
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:59,506
(I can do it with a professional mindset.)

372
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:03,106
I'm really proud
that I've become a lot more confident...

373
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,940
and mature.

374
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,815
(Cute and hot girl)

375
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,083
(A kitty with various charms)

376
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:07,917
(I can do it.)

377
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,824
(Tell me about JUUN.)

378
00:17:11,473 --> 00:17:13,857
(JUUN, an H2H member,
born on December 3, 2008)

379
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:15,391
(Do you want more details?)

380
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:16,706
Hi.

381
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,140
I'm JUUN.

382
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,840
My MBTI type is ISTJ...

383
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,073
with a bit of an emotional side.

384
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:28,706
My hobby is unwinding with a half-bath...

385
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:31,273
after working.

386
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,140
I love rapping and dancing.

387
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,240
I feel the happiest when I'm dancing.

388
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,840
The first genre I learned was popping.

389
00:17:42,706 --> 00:17:46,240
So, it's still the genre I'm best at.

390
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,473
It's also my favorite genre of dance.

391
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:49,973
Let me show you a little bit.

392
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,106
(Upper body popping)

393
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,673
Something like this.

394
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,240
I feel so shy.

395
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,573
I may look cool and charismatic on stage,

396
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:03,040
but offstage,

397
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,973
I'm as soft as tofu.

398
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:09,106
I guess I feel the most comfortable
around the members,

399
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:11,073
which is why they say I'm really gentle.

400
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,073
(JUUN's two sides)

401
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,906
(On stage)

402
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,173
When she dances, she literally soars.

403
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:20,623
And I could fall in love with her.

404
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,573
(Offstage, she becomes softy.)

405
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:24,440
I don't know how she can be so cute...

406
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,840
and kind during practice.

407
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,606
I'm a sweet girl.

408
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:31,106
(She really is
the embodiment of sweetness.)

409
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:33,940
This is the hand gesture I do
when I'm happy.

410
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,073
(Her soft, tofu-like charms)

411
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,008
(Addictive)

412
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:42,340
(The softy's dancing on the show
is irresistibly attractive.)

413
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:45,573
(Even her dance showcase is delightful.)

414
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,773
(She finishes it with a witty homage.)

415
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:52,073
Keep going!

416
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:54,540
(Her passion for dance shines
even without music.)

417
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:56,492
That's it! Don't stop!

418
00:18:56,806 --> 00:18:58,340
(Final footwork)

419
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,006
(Warning! The softy cutie JUUN is coming.)

420
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,240
(Where it all began)

421
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:08,440
I think I was in third grade...

422
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:10,740
when I first watched a video.

423
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:13,915
It was "ID: Peace B" by BoA.

424
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,006
The way she owned the stage...

425
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,473
left such a strong impression on me.

426
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:21,373
And I wanted
to become a singer like her too.

427
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:23,606
(BoA inspired JUUN to be a singer.)

428
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:27,273
Then, I started learning dance.

429
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:29,073
I won several awards,

430
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:32,173
and it felt incredibly rewarding
to see my own progress.

431
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,873
I love dancing.

432
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,540
(How did you join SM Entertainment?)

433
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,140
I wanted to express myself
through dancing,

434
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,340
so I uploaded...

435
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,440
many of my dance videos to social media.

436
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,706
One day, the agent sent a direct message,
and I ended up joining the company.

437
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,306
(The trainee life)

438
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,606
As a trainee,

439
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,940
I was determined to give my all,

440
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,673
and I really did my best.

441
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,506
There was a trainee showcase
open to the public,

442
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:08,540
and after it was over,

443
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,406
many people mentioned my name online.

444
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:16,406
I felt so proud to finally have my name...

445
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,040
known to the world.

446
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,175
Yes, I got first place.

447
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:22,073
I won.

448
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,306
(Is there something
you want to try after your debut?)

449
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:28,197
There's a song called "Only One" by BoA,

450
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,140
and many people associate it
with its partner dance.

451
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,073
I'd love to try that partner dance
with BoA.

452
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:38,073
I want to perform "Only One" with her,
no matter what.

453
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,540
I really want to do it.

454
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,373
"Attention!"

455
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,906
"I'm JUUN, ready to steal your heart
anytime, anywhere!"

456
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,206
Bye!

457
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:47,750
(A born-to-be dancer)

458
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,571
(Soft tofu)

459
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:49,706
(Different on and off the stage)

460
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:51,806
(Tell me about IAN.)

461
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:52,975
(IAN, an H2H member,
born on October 9, 2009)

462
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:53,743
(Do you want more details?)

463
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:55,373
It's time for an interview.

464
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:56,706
Hello.

465
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,106
I'm IAN, your dopamine generator!

466
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:02,573
I love hanging out with people.

467
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:06,206
My MBTI type is ENFP,

468
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,798
and I'd say I'm a fun-seeker.

469
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:12,306
(Extrovert IAN gets excited...)

470
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:14,440
(whenever she finds
something interesting...)

471
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,106
(or touching.)

472
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:17,840
I want to be an artist...

473
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,306
who's cool on stage
and makes everyone happy.

474
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:23,406
I tend to get really excited...

475
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:24,907
when I'm around the members,

476
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:28,140
and I think they feel the same way.

477
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,040
(Get ready for a dopamine rush? Let's go!)

478
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,006
IAN!

479
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:34,406
(A quick dopamine rush)

480
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:36,906
I'm flying!

481
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:37,940
Here I go!

482
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,240
(Dopamine Rush Stage One)

483
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,573
(Dopamine Rush Stage Two)

484
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:42,440
(Dopamine Rush Stage Max)

485
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:45,806
(With my members,
I always become so excited.)

486
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,106
(Simple greeting makes her happy.)

487
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:51,606
She's like an undying battery.

488
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:53,573
She always cheers me up.

489
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:56,773
I'm always grateful
for how bubbly she is with us.

490
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:58,606
(I'm so happy to have...)

491
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:00,606
(all the members' attention.)

492
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:02,606
(A shot to boost dopamine)

493
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,148
I need lots of your love!

494
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
"Is IAN the cutest in the world?"

495
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,673
"No. You're the cutest."

496
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:13,273
(Proud)

497
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,906
(Where it all began)

498
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,133
Since elementary school,

499
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,673
I've loved getting people's attention.

500
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:26,706
I thought it was such a wonderful thing...

501
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:31,373
to be loved by many people,
so it made me want to be a singer.

502
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:33,106
(IAN dreamed
of becoming a beloved artist.)

503
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:37,306
My parents are fans of many SM artists,

504
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,506
so they showed me
a lot of Girls' Generation videos.

505
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,573
I found them so cool
that I wanted to be one of them.

506
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,340
As a kid,
I was obsessed with social media.

507
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,006
One day, when I uploaded a short video,

508
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:55,340
a casting staff member saw it...

509
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,840
and sent me a direct message.

510
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,573
At first, I thought it was a scam...

511
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:02,873
because she didn't mention
which agency she was from.

512
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:05,740
But my mom had a good feeling,

513
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,640
so she told me to ask
where the agency was located.

514
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,040
It was in Seongdong-gu,

515
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,573
so I thought it could be SM Entertainment.

516
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:18,140
I thought it could be a chance
to realize my dream,

517
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,240
so I felt delighted.

518
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,773
(The trainee life)

519
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:22,740
It's been three whole years.

520
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,106
When I joined the company as a trainee,

521
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:32,473
everyone told me how tough it would be,

522
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:34,740
so I was a little scared.

523
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,240
It was so different from school,

524
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,440
and I realized there was so much to learn.

525
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,973
But when I accomplished my goals,

526
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:46,806
it felt really rewarding.

527
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:50,140
I think I'm most motivated...

528
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,298
when I receive compliments from others.

529
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,673
During my first evaluation,

530
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:58,006
they encouraged me with lots of praise,

531
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,440
saying, "You're a very talented girl."

532
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,473
"We believe you have big potential
to become an amazing artist,"

533
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:04,473
"so keep up the good work."

534
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:06,340
With the belief in myself,

535
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,540
I gave it my all.

536
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,073
(The journey toward her dream)

537
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:15,306
I practiced hard to master the basics,

538
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,773
and thanks to that foundation,

539
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,440
I've become who I am today.

540
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:22,406
(A genius idol)

541
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:23,352
(A human dopamine generator)

542
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:24,253
(A passionate extrovert)

543
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:26,540
(Tell me about YE-ON.)

544
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:30,459
(YE-ON, an H2H member,
born on April 19, 2010)

545
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:31,694
(Do you want more details?)

546
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,306
Hi, I'm YE-ON.

547
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,740
(YE-ON)

548
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,373
My name's "YE" means talent,
and "ON" means to build.

549
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:43,740
I'm YE-ON, and I want to achieve
many things with my talents.

550
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,673
I'm from Yangsan, Gyeongsangnam-do,

551
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:48,873
and I'm the youngest on the team.

552
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:50,640
I'd say she's the diamond-like youngest.

553
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:53,273
All members adore me.

554
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:57,106
(Coddling the gem-like youngest)

555
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:58,373
So cute.

556
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,806
- You did a good job.
- That's so cute!

557
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,406
(They give the youngest
unlimited applause.)

558
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,306
It's all right.

559
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,773
- It's okay.
- Don't worry.

560
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,906
Let's go.

561
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,406
Hello, cutie.

562
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:12,040
You're just so cute.

563
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,973
I just want to smoosh her little cheeks.

564
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,340
I wish I could shrink you...

565
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,173
and keep you in my pocket everywhere.

566
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:19,540
You're just so adorable.

567
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:21,840
(The synonym for YE-ON is cute.)

568
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,806
I love it.

569
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,473
My MBTI personality type is ISTJ.

570
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:29,806
I'm extremely rational and organized.

571
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,373
I'm a very disciplined individual.

572
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:35,906
I'm good at waking up early.

573
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:39,015
Sometimes, when some members have
trouble getting up,

574
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,973
I knock on their doors and wake them up.

575
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,073
We'll try harder to get up on time
so you don't have to wake us up.

576
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:46,506
(YE-ON's character)

577
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:47,740
I'm a quiet chatterbox.

578
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,306
(Whispering)

579
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:52,440
(Endlessly talking to herself)

580
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,773
What is it?

581
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,006
(She talks to the camera too.)

582
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:58,040
Should I make it smaller?

583
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,640
(Quite serious)

584
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,006
(It's the morning fairy's bedtime.)

585
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,106
(Unwavering peace)

586
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:08,673
(Shaky hands)

587
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,206
What are you making?

588
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:12,840
I'm making a dragon.

589
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,206
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

590
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,906
It's not because I want to taste it.

591
00:26:17,273 --> 00:26:19,106
(She takes a bite of the tangerine.)

592
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,973
(Everything feels like a miracle
for this diamond-like YE-ON).

593
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,540
"Let YE-ON be the light of your life."

594
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,506
"Switch it on."

595
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:32,340
(Where it all began)

596
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:38,673
I was a kid singer and a musical actor
when I was young.

597
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:40,240
Every time I was on stage,

598
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,440
I felt thrilled and renewed.

599
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:46,064
(How did you join SM Entertainment?)

600
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:50,406
My parents uploaded a video
of me singing and musical performance.

601
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:51,806
The company saw them...

602
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:54,273
and messaged me to offer an audition.

603
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,673
I was really surprised...

604
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:59,473
and thought I had to do it.

605
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,106
(The trainee life)

606
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:04,415
It was last year,

607
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,806
when I was 13.

608
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:10,573
I had the shortest training period,

609
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:14,373
so I was eager to be
as good as the other members.

610
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:17,073
Whenever I face challenges,
I rely on them.

611
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:20,640
I want to be an artist
who always shows growth.

612
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,806
(The hours devoted to chasing the future)

613
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,540
Although I was scared about my future,

614
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,640
the excitement was even bigger.

615
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,106
I'm so excited to see...

616
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,840
what the future holds for me.

617
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:35,940
Let's go!

618
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:39,615
(The diamond youngest)

619
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:40,616
(Calmness)

620
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,650
(The morning fairy)
