1
00:00:00,553 --> 00:00:01,300
(How was Partner's Day?)

2
00:00:01,404 --> 00:00:02,328
(What's your plan?)

3
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:03,607
(The Blues)

4
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:05,639
- Let's go.
- We have to walk a lot.

5
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,096
- You have 50 dollars.
- Right.

6
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:12,603
(They must arrive in 50 minutes
with 50 dollars.)

7
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:14,748
Check the die first.

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,351
That can't be true!

9
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:19,035
(Forget the numbers.)

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,889
(Bring in the arithmetic.)

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,458
(Can they keep their 50 dollars safe
from the mystery die?)

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,803
(Sensing a threat to their allowance)

13
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,193
(Dumbfounded)

14
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:30,230
Plus, multiply,

15
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,391
and divide.

16
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,724
What do we do?

17
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,526
Let's go! Here we come!

18
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:36,770
Off we go!

19
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,131
Model walking!

20
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,160
Where is this?

21
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,409
Where are we? Where am I?

22
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:46,146
CARMEN, please get a grip!

23
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:47,627
We have to run.

24
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,384
- Let's go.
- We're going to shed some weight!

25
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:53,174
This must be it.

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,265
- I see "Digital Tower."
- Yes.

27
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:58,225
- It's "Digital Tower" in English.
- All right!

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,630
Digital Tower.

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,100
I'll hold it.

30
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:04,131
Let's make sure to win more money
and not lose any.

31
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,803
(Please!)

32
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:07,304
(So nervous)

33
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:09,503
Should I roll it now? Here I go.

34
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:13,173
Our fate!

35
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,877
I want to add or multiply the money.

36
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:19,880
- Please!
- Please!

37
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:24,402
(Minus one)

38
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:26,197
(Optimism gone)

39
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,522
This can't be true!

40
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,592
This isn't right. It can't be real.

41
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,061
That's a ten-dollar deduction.

42
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,580
It's okay.

43
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:37,828
Yes, it's good.

44
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:40,140
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay!

45
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,992
It's our fate.

46
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,775
Hold on.

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,402
(We may have lost our money,
but not our style!)

48
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:46,666
So sweet!

49
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:49,109
- Sweet girl!
- Sweet girl!

50
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,113
Let's go.

51
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:51,945
Sorry.

52
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,804
That's okay! Our baby!

53
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,949
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

54
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,718
This must be the Steak Apartment!

55
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,219
Do we get steak here?

56
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:04,224
The next stop is
"Seoul Forest Steak Apartment."

57
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,559
- There's such an apartment?
- Steak?

58
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,127
There's a Steak Apartment?

59
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:09,129
Is it the same steak I'm thinking of?

60
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:11,632
(The strange name that caught JUUN's eyes)

61
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:13,917
This is the Steak Apartment!

62
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:16,570
- You have to roll it well.
- For sure!

63
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,738
Oh, no!

64
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,404
(Holding an optimism ritual again)

65
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:21,599
(Scanning the die)

66
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,076
Will I do a good job?

67
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:25,679
I see the pressure on your shoulders.

68
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,547
My shoulders are heavy
with all the pressure!

69
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,750
We're doomed if we get "multiply zero."

70
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,084
Yes, it'll be game over.

71
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,085
You can't get that.

72
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,655
We have 40 dollars now.

73
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,273
(JUUN is scanning something.)

74
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:39,026
Throw it well.
Watch out for the slope here.

75
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:41,598
(Making scientific calculations
based on geographic features)

76
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:43,530
Aim for the middle.

77
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,266
I'm so scared!
We're doomed if we get this!

78
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,341
Please!

79
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:49,302
Let's go.

80
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,007
(Throwing the die onto the best spot)

81
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,609
(What will CARMEN's optimism...)

82
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,012
(and JUUN's scientific approach
lead them to?)

83
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,096
(Happy)

84
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:03,971
No way!

85
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,914
(They got their allowance back.)

86
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,998
We got it back!

87
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:09,289
Great job, CARMEN!

88
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:10,901
(That's the optimism queen.)

89
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,260
- We have 50 dollars now.
- I'm so relieved.

90
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,795
This is so much fun.

91
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:16,742
Go!

92
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:18,198
Let's go.

93
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,769
The murals are beautiful.

94
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,214
- Backpack.
- I've never seen it.

95
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:25,205
- That's a bus.
- Bus.

96
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,573
It's a maple leaf!

97
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,543
We have a signature hand sign.

98
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,848
Turn back and show it...

99
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:31,845
- in three.
- In three?

100
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,180
Okay, in three?

101
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:35,048
Ready?

102
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,550
In 1, 2, 3.

103
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:39,981
(We can feel her maple leaf mastery
in seconds.)

104
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:43,457
That's CARMEN's signature hand gesture.

105
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:44,391
Thank you.

106
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,793
- Should we move on?
- Let's go!

107
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,727
Wow!

108
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:50,263
"Sungsu Technical High School Front."

109
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,655
Oh, goodness.

110
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:52,930
- I'm scared.
- It's time.

111
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:54,835
- I'm scared!
- Okay.

112
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,504
There's a quiz for you...

113
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,406
before you throw the die here.

114
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,324
A quiz?

115
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:03,017
(Sighing)

116
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,745
I'm getting so nervous.

117
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,847
I'm the worst at quizzes.

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,083
Which of the following
was not on the mural on the way?

119
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,052
- I'll give you choices.
- Okay.

120
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,797
(Focused)

121
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,222
One, a book.

122
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:16,957
- We saw it.
- Yes, we did.

123
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:18,709
(So sure of it)

124
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,193
Two, a backpack.

125
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,561
- We saw it.
- Did we?

126
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,700
(Quickly eliminating the first two)

127
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,799
Three, a cat.

128
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:26,800
- No.
- We didn't see it.

129
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:29,199
(The third choice is
likely to be the answer.)

130
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,071
Four, a globe.

131
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,596
- Yes.
- Yes.

132
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,608
Five, a bus.

133
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,931
Six, a maple leaf.

134
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,316
(Sure about the maple leaf)

135
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,280
Seven, an owl.

136
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,769
An owl?

137
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:44,851
Did we see an owl?

138
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,853
We didn't see an owl or a cat.

139
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,389
Is it an owl or a cat?

140
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,758
- It must be the cat.
- Did we see a cat?

141
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,127
I don't think so. I don't remember it.

142
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:57,214
(Did they miss it, or was it not there?)

143
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,598
Did you see an owl?

144
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,867
No, I didn't see it either.

145
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,369
What?

146
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,737
I didn't see either.

147
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,572
Is it 3 or 7?

148
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,842
An owl would go better...

149
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,310
with the rest of the things on the mural.

150
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,078
- But a cat wouldn't fit.
- Right?

151
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:15,515
- It doesn't seem relevant.
- No, it doesn't.

152
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,050
That makes sense, right?

153
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:18,752
Let's choose three.

154
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,307
- Three, a cat!
- Three, a cat!

155
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:25,142
(Which of the following
was not on the mural on the way?)

156
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:26,126
You're correct.

157
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,932
(A spot-on guess)

158
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:29,996
We were right!

159
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:33,590
(An owl was at the top
of the green mural.)

160
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,770
You get two chances to throw the die.

161
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,205
(It's for getting the question right.)

162
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,640
- It can be bad or good.
- Yes, we don't know it yet.

163
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,490
We must be careful.

164
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,478
(The double chances can be bad for them.)

165
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,167
Should we throw it once each?

166
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:47,314
Once each?

167
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,317
I hope we get a good one.

168
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,168
Please!

169
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:54,421
- Here I go.
- Here she goes.

170
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,089
The slope is too steep here.

171
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,724
Is that why you've placed us here?

172
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:00,093
- It must've been on purpose!
- I'll go here.

173
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,445
Here I go.

174
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,283
It's okay!

175
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,233
You'll do well!

176
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,407
(Will they continue to gain more money?)

177
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:13,278
(They got the best one, "times two.")

178
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,504
(No way!)

179
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,176
We have 100 dollars now!

180
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,302
- It's the best!
- We have 100 dollars!

181
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,811
I'm getting a bad feeling now.

182
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:22,912
No, don't feel pressured. You can do it.

183
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:27,413
Hold on.

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,850
Let's go.

185
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:30,647
(Double the pressure)

186
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,392
It's okay. You can do it.

187
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,706
(Today's allowance depends
on CARMEN's throw.)

188
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,266
(A gentle throw)

189
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:43,013
(That can't be!)

190
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:44,497
This...

191
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,406
How?

192
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,731
(What's making them so shocked?)

193
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:52,980
(A 1-in-a-36 chance
of getting double-doubles)

194
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,948
(Jackpot!)

195
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,616
(The variety shows rookies are frozen.)

196
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,169
(Oh, gosh. Hug me first!)

197
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,087
- How much do we have now?
- We have 200 dollars!

198
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,555
We have 200 dollars?

199
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,991
It's double 100 dollars, so 200 dollars.

200
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,137
This was meant to be!

201
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,596
You have 200 dollars now.

202
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:12,035
- No way!
- What a miracle!

203
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:13,016
This is amazing!

204
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,385
- We're so rich with 200 dollars!
- We're rich!

205
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,235
Rich!

206
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,305
We won 200 dollars.

207
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:20,911
- Look at how chill we are.
- We have 200 dollars!

208
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,575
We have 200 dollars.

209
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,844
- We're getting so rich!
- I know!

210
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,946
Total rich!

211
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,580
My goodness, the sound!

212
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,951
I could write a song with that sound.

213
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:33,053
(A happy celebration
of the double-doubles)

214
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,557
No, let's not do that.

215
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:39,602
No rapping.

216
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,498
(We'll do a celebration rap next time.)

217
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,120
We have to keep running.

218
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,333
I forgot.

219
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,183
(One, two!)

220
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,822
Look at us running outside.

221
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,103
We're running.

222
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,376
We're running as fast as we can.

223
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,044
We've arrived.

224
00:07:58,074 --> 00:07:59,407
"Kyungil Middle and High School."

225
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,214
I hope we can keep our 200 dollars!

226
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,415
Our 200 dollars!

227
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,552
JUUN, you can do it!

228
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,887
You got this!

229
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:10,260
(Filled up with optimism)

230
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,110
You can do it!

231
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:13,137
(Will they continue to rise...)

232
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:14,972
(as high as the die thrown up?)

233
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,184
(Yet another double)

234
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:21,852
(How can they be...)

235
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:23,573
(unbelievably lucky?)

236
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,306
(Their luckiest day)

237
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,841
(The impossible has happened.)

238
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:28,645
(A triple-double)

239
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:29,800
(That's 400 dollars.)

240
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,278
We're so rich right now!

241
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:33,840
I feel like I'm a millionaire.

242
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,016
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

243
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,884
Why do you look sour?

244
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:40,353
Thank you!

245
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,688
- We have to win!
- Let's run!

246
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:43,857
Yes, we do!

247
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,847
We're so lucky.

248
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,260
Girls with 400 dollars!

249
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,862
We must keep the money at all costs.

250
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,743
Four minutes? Three?

251
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:52,665
I don't think we have that much time.

252
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,101
- We don't have time. We have to run!
- Yes, we do!

253
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,569
We run fast.

254
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,272
- We don't have time.
- No time!

255
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,341
- SM!
- Our building!

256
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,243
That means...

257
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,484
we're getting closer to the bus stop
from which we started.

258
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:08,334
Right.

259
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,284
- Did we make it?
- Yes, we only have one more throw.

260
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,964
We just have one more throw to do well on.

261
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:15,155
We've arrived.

262
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:18,458
- We've arrived at the starting spot.
- Yes!

263
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,437
(Did they finish it under 50 minutes?)

264
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,295
- We're back.
- Yes, we are.

265
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,997
You took 48 minutes and 50 seconds.

266
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:25,629
(Barely made it)

267
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,634
We barely made it.

268
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:28,959
(So far, so good!)

269
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,171
You must play a game.

270
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,737
We'll just give you the money...

271
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:35,408
- if one of you succeeds.
- Okay.

272
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,978
But we'll take one arithmetic sign out
if you both fail.

273
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,382
That's so mean!

274
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:43,950
Really?

275
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:46,732
- Fine, then. We'll succeed.
- Fine.

276
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:48,955
We earned 400 dollars, after all!

277
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,373
What is it?

278
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:55,361
What's the most memorable bus stop
you've passed?

279
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,230
The Steak Apartment.

280
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,133
If you can nail the "Perfect Pitch Game"
with it,

281
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:01,672
- you get 400.
- What?

282
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,804
The "Perfect Pitch Game?"

283
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:10,176
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

284
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,481
(That's ten syllables long.)

285
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:12,745
Make a syllable higher pitched.

286
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,880
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

287
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:16,850
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

288
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,700
Seoul...

289
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:19,285
You can go slowly.

290
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,889
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

291
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,557
- Seoul...
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

292
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,407
I get it!

293
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,661
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.
- That's right.

294
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,265
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

295
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,366
I'll try it again.

296
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,504
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

297
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,440
No, wait!

298
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:41,674
Give me a second.

299
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:43,743
Okay. I got it.

300
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,337
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

301
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:49,362
Seoul Forest Steak...

302
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:50,962
Oh, no!

303
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:53,153
- The key is to go slowly.
- Slowly.

304
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,587
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.
- Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

305
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:00,176
Seoul Forest Steak...

306
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,720
You need to raise
the pitch higher each time.

307
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:06,679
No, I mean...

308
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:08,725
(Having perfect pitch is
really hard, indeed.)

309
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:09,827
You have two chances.

310
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:11,116
- Tell us when you're ready.
- Okay.

311
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,906
- You go first.
- I'll go first.

312
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,207
Are you ready?

313
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,146
JUUN, you got this.

314
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,243
You can do it.

315
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:18,118
I'll go.

316
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:22,804
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

317
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:26,716
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

318
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,565
(The team's ace gets off
to a steady start.)

319
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:32,959
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

320
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,272
(Can she pull it off in one go?)

321
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:37,540
"Seoul Forest Steak Mart."

322
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,461
Fail.

323
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:40,757
(She got the wrong address.)

324
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:41,607
You were so close!

325
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:43,433
(JUUN failed,
letting down everyone's expectations.)

326
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,417
- You were almost there.
- Oh, no.

327
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,507
We have only one more chance, right?

328
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,975
I'm the problem.

329
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,510
What a problem!

330
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:52,445
You should take it slow.

331
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,012
(She's never even gotten close
to the apartment,)

332
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,396
(just gotten lost around Seoul Forest.)

333
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,909
I can do it. I'll take it really slow.

334
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,626
Please keep in mind
that she's not a native Korean speaker.

335
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,994
Let's go, CARMEN.

336
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,510
It's our last chance.

337
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,031
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

338
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,566
(Behind the nervous CARMEN,)

339
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,175
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

340
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:24,798
(JUUN's finger moves up and down in sync.)

341
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,192
(Thanks to her,
CARMEN's pitch is very stable.)

342
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,174
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

343
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:32,816
(She even clears
the hardest part of the apartment.)

344
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:35,735
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

345
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:37,181
(Let's raise it to the end.)

346
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:39,402
(CARMEN did it!)

347
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:40,904
You did a great job!

348
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,238
We are amazing!

349
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:44,267
(They cleared the endgame
with their positivity.)

350
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,798
It ends in our victory.

351
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,934
Thank you.

352
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:50,940
(The final dice roll)

353
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,572
Can we just not roll it?

354
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,040
(They're done adapting a variety show.)

355
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:55,441
Make sure you don't get this.

356
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,927
(Sighing)

357
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:58,777
Please.

358
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,714
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment!

359
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,416
- Here I go.
- Here she goes.

360
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:04,748
(Will they keep the 400 dollars, or not?)

361
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:06,552
Please let it be a plus!

362
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,085
(What will they get?)

363
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:11,915
(She really got a plus!)

364
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,557
(They are lucky until the end!)

365
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:15,028
We won 420 dollars!

366
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,330
It's our victory!

367
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:18,564
It was impressive.

368
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,097
(The Lucky Positivity Duo earned
a 420-dollar allowance.)

369
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:22,602
We're rich now.

370
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,904
- Best friend charms.
- It's an honor.

371
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:26,215
Thank you.

372
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:27,812
What's this?

373
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,392
- Oh, my.
- Our names!

374
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,545
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

375
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:33,980
It's adorable.

376
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:37,071
- We did it!
- We did it!

377
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,473
(Show us YUHA's past life regression.)

378
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:41,943
- Hello.
- Hello.

379
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:43,222
It's nice to meet you.

380
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,582
(A-NA will monitor it after her turn.)

381
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,362
(Previously, in A-NA's past lives)

382
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,764
- I'm selling some spinach.
- Spinach?

383
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,174
There were so many bad boys,

384
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,369
I got sick of it. So I'm single now.

385
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,290
I am on the road,
holding a bag of spinach.

386
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,464
Then, I get hit by a car.

387
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,807
(How does A-NA predict YUHA's past life?)

388
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:05,912
I think...

389
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,582
YUHA was a queen in the Joseon Dynasty.

390
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,717
She was 46.

391
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:15,254
She had three daughters and a son.

392
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,624
I think she had a job
that required good calligraphy skills.

393
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,718
I wrote that she was cynical and sassy...

394
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,663
because she's nothing like that
in this life.

395
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:26,285
I guess she had the opposite personality
in her past life.

396
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:30,103
Don't be nervous,
and try to let everything go.

397
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:32,996
Imagine yourself as a plushie.

398
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:37,110
Now, you're a plushie stuffed with cotton.

399
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,046
(It's different than Bo Reum's case,
which was a cloud.)

400
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:43,116
Your arm, filled with cotton,
becomes lighter...

401
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,785
on the count of 1, 2, 3.

402
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,504
It's so light that it floats.

403
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,488
(It is so interesting to be a viewer.)

404
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,461
Now, imagine you're in a theater,

405
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:58,197
sitting in the most comfortable chair
you can picture,

406
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:02,101
facing a large screen.

407
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:05,468
You're holding a kernel of popcorn.

408
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:09,142
What's your favorite flavor of popcorn?

409
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,499
- Caramel...
- Caramel popcorn.

410
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:15,118
Imagine you're holding
a kernel of caramel popcorn.

411
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,006
She's beautiful.

412
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,809
(She gazes at her with such pride.)

413
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,554
She looks like a female lead in a movie.

414
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,824
Now you're about to watch a movie...

415
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,360
while holding the popcorn.

416
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:30,663
Think of moments in your life that left...

417
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,567
a strong impression,
like scenes from a movie or a drama.

418
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:38,961
Looking back,

419
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:41,411
what moment left
the strongest impression on you?

420
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,527
Let's see it on the screen.

421
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,045
In 1, 2, 3.

422
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:48,411
Oh, my.

423
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,589
(She's already fully immersed.)

424
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,051
- My grandma...
- Your grandma?

425
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:54,604
She's about to pass away.

426
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,190
I think she's crying.

427
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,531
How old were you?

428
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:03,185
I was in elementary school.

429
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,730
I see.

430
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,667
- At the hospital...
- Yes?

431
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,546
(Shedding tears)

432
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,789
You loved her a lot, didn't you?

433
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:14,246
Yes.

434
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,413
What did that little YUHA want...

435
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,379
to be when she grew up?

436
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,012
- I wanted to be...
- Yes.

437
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,250
in front of many people.

438
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,617
- You want a spotlight?
- Yes.

439
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,467
(Her dream has come true.)

440
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:34,760
Even before you were born in this life,
there must have been many memories,

441
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:38,965
like scenes from a movie,
in your past life.

442
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,717
Open yourself up
so you can bring back memories...

443
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,936
of your past life.

444
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,440
In 1, 2, 3.

445
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:49,259
(What genre of movies was
her past life like?)

446
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,708
What past life memory...

447
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,096
are you seeing on the screen?

448
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:56,415
What do you see?

449
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,070
I'm in Europe.

450
00:16:58,368 --> 00:16:59,919
So you're in Europe.

451
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,188
- In Germany.
- In Germany.

452
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,292
She's a foreigner? Good for her.

453
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:09,896
How do you look there?

454
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,164
I'm lying on my bed.

455
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,866
You're lying on your bed?

456
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,736
Are you a grown-up or a child?

457
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,608
I'm a girl.

458
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,107
I'm 17.

459
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,708
I see. You're 17.

460
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:26,122
She's 17? We're the same age.

461
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:31,083
Do you look like a noblewoman?

462
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:32,644
Yes.

463
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:34,066
(Gasping)

464
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:35,211
I envy her.

465
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:36,976
(Smiling)

466
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,157
Look around...

467
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:41,294
and see if your family is with you
in the house.

468
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,192
My mom is...

469
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:45,831
at the table.

470
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:47,600
- My dad is...
- Yes?

471
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:48,968
in the garden.

472
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,314
She has a garden?

473
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,340
What does your family call you?

474
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:55,686
Ella.

475
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:56,879
- Ella?
- Yes.

476
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:59,679
In your past life, your name was Ella.

477
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:03,149
Do you think you're beautiful?

478
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,599
Yes.

479
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:07,219
Is she even beautiful?

480
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,222
She's rich and pretty. I envy that.

481
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,092
What's her personality?

482
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,428
- She's calm...
- Yes.

483
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,697
- and curious.
- Okay.

484
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,086
She's also pure...

485
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,424
and imaginative.

486
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:22,868
She's imaginative?

487
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,303
She sounds like a princess.

488
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,511
(Ella has it all.)

489
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,799
(A-NA's prediction:
Queen in Joseon Dynasty, Aloof and proud)

490
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:30,009
What talents does Ella have?

491
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,911
She's good at crafting.

492
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:33,879
She's handy.

493
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,250
Think of the most impressive thing
Ella has made.

494
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,752
A pouch.

495
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,169
Sorry?

496
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,904
(Spinach and pouch! It's destiny!)

497
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:47,126
Let's fast-forward
to when you're in your 20s.

498
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:49,962
How is your life? In 1, 2, 3.

499
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,898
A party.

500
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,495
- A party?
- A party!

501
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:57,503
I'm with a man.

502
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:58,777
Oh, my.

503
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,917
My goodness.

504
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,176
What's your relationship with him?

505
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:08,148
Ella doesn't like him.

506
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:10,807
(It's getting juicy!)

507
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:14,220
But her parents insist on the marriage.

508
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,289
(An arranged marriage,
just like in the dramas!)

509
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,757
That's unfair.

510
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:22,795
Let's see if you married that man.

511
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,156
No.

512
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,466
- Did you marry another man?
- Yes.

513
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:29,999
Who did she marry? I couldn't get married.

514
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,005
How did you meet him?

515
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,341
- On the street,
- Yes.

516
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,710
I was eating bread.

517
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:39,679
- You were eating bread?
- Yes.

518
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:43,149
Let's find out
if Ella had a happy marriage.

519
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,251
Can you see
what her married life was like?

520
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,319
Was it a happy marriage?

521
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:48,567
Yes.

522
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:49,905
I moved out of my parents' house.

523
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,490
You did?

524
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:53,693
- I'm not rich,
- Yes.

525
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:56,429
but I'm happy with my husband.

526
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,031
Do you have any children
with your husband?

527
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:00,826
- Yes.
- My gosh.

528
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,835
How many children do you have?

529
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,055
(A-NA's guess: Three daughters and a son)

530
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,061
(She wants Ella to have many children!)

531
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,476
Two.

532
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,241
I got everything wrong.

533
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,912
How is Ella's life as a middle-aged woman?

534
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,648
- She's rich,
- Yes.

535
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,388
but she lives a humble life.

536
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,985
A humble life.

537
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,021
I envy her.

538
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,106
(She envies Ella forever.)

539
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:27,093
Let's see how Ella is doing in her 60s.

540
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:30,563
Is she still living happily
with her husband?

541
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,630
Yes.

542
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,033
They're watching a lake together.

543
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,701
What is she doing?

544
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,104
- She's knitting.
- Knitting.

545
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,106
She's having a leisurely life.

546
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,477
Let's see when and how she passes away.

547
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,162
Go to the moment on her deathbed.

548
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,089
In 1, 2...

549
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:48,114
Already?

550
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,365
A church?

551
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,119
She passes away at a church?

552
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,856
Who's with you in your final moment?

553
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,379
- My daughter is.
- Your daughter is with you.

554
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:02,608
- Have any regrets as you pass away?
- No.

555
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,897
- You have no regret?
- No.

556
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,566
She has no regret?

557
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:08,804
I envy her.

558
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:10,226
(The last of last time
her saying, "I envy her.")

559
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:11,076
Is there anything...

560
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:13,239
YUHA wants...

561
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:16,776
from Ella's life in this one?

562
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,111
I want to be as fearless...

563
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:21,150
and confident as she was.

564
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:22,700
Now,

565
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:27,092
fill yourself
with Ella's fearlessness and confidence.

566
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,355
Now you're coming back to us.

567
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,605
What's wrong?

568
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:34,693
- Thanks for your good work.
- Thank you.

569
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,693
(All of her guesses turned out
to be wrong.)

570
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:39,422
(A big smile Seeing A-NA)

571
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:41,197
- You can't help but cry, can you?
- No.

572
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:42,297
It was amazing.

573
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,771
It's rare to see you cry.

574
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,698
I envied you for being rich...

575
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:50,876
and having a great husband.

576
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:52,601
(Their past lives were opposites.)

577
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:53,859
What?

578
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,248
- Mine was pretty detailed, right?
- Yes.

579
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,287
You wrote 46.
All your guesses were wrong.

580
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:00,519
- You got the Joseon Dynasty part right.
- Yes.

581
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,685
(YUHA won because she made
one correct guess.)

582
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,875
(Here are the best friend charms
for the winner.)

583
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:07,660
Can I have both?

584
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,497
Come on. You had such a great past life.
Can you at least give me one?

585
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,783
- Don't you feel sorry for me?
- All right.

586
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,786
- Listen to your parents, right? Be good.
- Thanks.

587
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,738
- It's so cute.
- This is adorable.
