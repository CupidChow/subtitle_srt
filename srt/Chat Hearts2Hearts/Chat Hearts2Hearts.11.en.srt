1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,767
(H2H, how's your school life?)

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,593
(What if all H2H members were
in one class?)

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,214
(A new term has begun for Division 2-24.)

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,518
You're so funny!

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,187
Look at the camera and say, "Hop, hop!"

6
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:22,455
Hello!

7
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,023
(A trilingual girl from Bali and a blonde)

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,126
(Beside the two popular, bubbly girls)

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,229
- This equation is...
- We should divide x and y.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,765
- It's "The Chase!"
- I'm getting excited.

11
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,135
(And a girl clearly needs magnesium)

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,237
(A happy start to the new term)

13
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,406
(YUHA and JUUN talked in class.)

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,274
Hey, girls!

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,477
What are you doing, JIWOO?

16
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,811
- What?
- What's going on?

17
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,146
(Cheering loudly)

18
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,948
What are you doing?

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,618
- Attention, everyone.
- Okay.

20
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,320
A new term has begun at H2H School.

21
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,288
(An exciting new term)

22
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,592
We'd better decide
which clubs to join for the term.

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,193
Right.

24
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:02,829
- That sounds good!
- We have...

25
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,432
the student government,
international club, mental health club...

26
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,636
JIWOO, memorize them!

27
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,672
You're the class president,
so memorize them!

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,941
These are the four clubs.

29
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,311
Let's talk and decide
who will join which club.

30
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,812
- That sounds good.
- It's a plan!

31
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,780
What's the mental health club?

32
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,150
The mental health club...

33
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,152
- Memorize it!
- Why is your voice quivering?

34
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,056
(A mental breakdown while explaining
the mental health club)

35
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,925
- Don't get nervous!
- Your eyes look so lost!

36
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,928
The mental health club cares
for the student's mental well-being.

37
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,097
It has an essential role, then.

38
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,932
So, someone like me.

39
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,768
(Not at all!)

40
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,637
What do the student government
and the gaming club do?

41
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,874
The student government must set
a good example for the school.

42
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,342
- I can do that!
- That's me!

43
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,577
That's me!

44
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,813
- That's totally me!
- It's me!

45
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,582
- My gosh! That's totally me!
- It's so me.

46
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,152
- And the gaming club?
- Its goal is to entertain everyone.

47
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,654
That's also me!

48
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,089
- I should join that.
- I'd better join the gaming club.

49
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,158
That's totally me.

50
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,894
- Should we decide on the clubs now?
- That'd be good!

51
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,939
Let's start with the student government.

52
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,099
- Me!
- Me!

53
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,168
Me!

54
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,503
- Is that everyone?
- I deserve to join.

55
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,673
- The student government.
- Everyone, except CARMEN?

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,208
Me too. I'm perfect
for student government.

57
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,510
CARMEN, don't you want to join
the student government?

58
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,512
- I want to join the gaming club.
- The gaming club?

59
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,314
- I see!
- She wants to join the gaming club!

60
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,217
- Okay.
- Why don't you...

61
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,686
each explain why you should join?

62
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,954
- I'll go first.
- That sounds good.

63
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,226
As everyone knows,
I have the top grades in the school.

64
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,161
From the bottom!

65
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,662
First place from the bottom!

66
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:44,930
- Congratulations.
- We know.

67
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,366
- We know it so well.
- From the bottom.

68
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,534
Is that your reason?

69
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,003
IAN, why don't you join
the student rebels instead?

70
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,839
(The club to lead those left behind)

71
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,042
- Good one!
- And you, A-NA?

72
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,376
Is that all for me?

73
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,178
Okay!

74
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,447
Hold on, girls.

75
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,116
It seems like everyone has chosen
the student government...

76
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,452
just because they want to.

77
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,022
However, there are requirements
for joining the student government.

78
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,857
- What are they? Tell us.
- First,

79
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,693
you must be a charismatic leader.

80
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,362
- That's me!
- That's me!

81
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,263
That's me.

82
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,234
Second, you need to shine
as an exemplary student.

83
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,301
That's me!

84
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:23,969
That's me!

85
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,839
Think again...

86
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,109
before raising your hands to sign up.

87
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,079
I'll pass.

88
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,781
I didn't think through it.

89
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,248
I'm not confident anymore.

90
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,051
- YE-ON, why should you join?
- Pitch yourself.

91
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,621
I'm a rule follower,

92
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,323
so I can set a good example
for other students.

93
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,193
You're also a great example in Pilates!
Your posture is perfect!

94
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:49,628
Right!

95
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,230
(A great example trained by Pilates)

96
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,833
- Can I vouch for myself?
- Sure, go ahead.

97
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,902
Everyone!

98
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,370
I'd better go up to speak.

99
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,206
What are you doing?

100
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,075
Everyone!

101
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,843
Look to the back.

102
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,212
(What's in the back?)

103
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,215
- What is it?
- This is my leadership!

104
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,783
Thank you.

105
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,385
We weren't supposed to look!

106
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,920
Don't you know about the famous meme?

107
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,388
YE-ON, why did you fall for it?

108
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,591
- What a leader!
- She's good!

109
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,660
- I admit she's good.
- She's a leader!

110
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,096
You can't join the student government
like that.

111
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,930
Why not?

112
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,899
Student government members must be kind.

113
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,402
I care for everyone behind their backs.

114
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,670
Isn't that true? In 1, 2, 3.

115
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:32,638
True!

116
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,277
I want to join the student government.
Pick me!

117
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,880
Everyone has spoken,

118
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,116
so let's vote for who should join,
excluding yourself.

119
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,483
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

120
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,984
JIWOO, aren't you going to do your speech?

121
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,020
I don't need it.

122
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,655
- With what confidence?
- Why not?

123
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,791
Where did you get such confidence?

124
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,029
Can you show us how kind you are?

125
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,398
Or can you do something we make you do?

126
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,367
Show us three cute poses right now.

127
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,235
- Let's see them.
- We'll vote for you, then.

128
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,104
- In 1, 2, 3, 4.
- In 5, 6, 7, 8!

129
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,406
(JIWOO's usual way of being cute)

130
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,808
(Groaning)

131
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,011
(Ready to tease JIWOO)

132
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,448
(What will JIWOO do?)

133
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,260
(Pointing her cheeks)

134
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,352
(Reality hitting her immediately)

135
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,986
(Laughing)

136
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,622
That was cute.

137
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,390
- Keep going!
- In 1, 2, 3.

138
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,349
(Cat punch)

139
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,835
(You're so good!)

140
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,360
- In 1, 2, 3!
- In 1, 2, 3!

141
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,337
(Petal JIWOO)

142
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,629
- Okay!
- Okay!

143
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,499
I'm voting for JIWOO!

144
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:34,434
(She's up for the job.)

145
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:38,603
You must vote for one person
other than yourself.

146
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,940
- Everyone, close your eyes.
- Okay.

147
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,508
- Let's vote for each other.
- Deal!

148
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,508
I believe in you.

149
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,913
Raise your hand if you think
A-NA should join.

150
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,180
A-NA should join.

151
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,049
In 1, 2, 3.

152
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,084
Thank you!

153
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,454
- Thanks.
- Okay, then.

154
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,390
Raise your hand if you think
YE-ON should join.

155
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,429
Okay.

156
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,096
IAN, it's so obvious
when you raise your hand.

157
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,998
I can hear the rustling.

158
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:11,203
Raise your hand if you think
JIWOO should join.

159
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,381
Can JIWOO see who's voting for her?

160
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,273
Yes, as I'm the class president.

161
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,611
(JIWOO got two votes.)

162
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,379
Raise your hand if you think
YUHA should join.

163
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,148
(I do!)

164
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,349
- That was so loud.
- It was so obvious!

165
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,018
(YUHA got one vote.)

166
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,821
Everyone could only vote once.

167
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,623
A-NA got zero votes.

168
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,692
(The heartbreak is worse
for the one who loves more.)

169
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,827
(YE-ON and JIWOO got the most votes.)

170
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:35,795
JIWOO and YE-ON!

171
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,696
(JIWOO and YE-ON are
in student government.)

172
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,364
- No way!
- Thank you!

173
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,334
It's us!

174
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,467
Congratulations!

175
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,770
We'll do our best.

176
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,738
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

177
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,607
Congratulations!

178
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,243
(Student Government: JIWOO and YE-ON)

179
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,978
Which club is next?

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,314
The attendance club.

181
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,385
- Attendance club!
- Attendance club!

182
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,520
(The friends get along so well.)

183
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,722
Let's choose
the international club members.

184
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,624
- What's the international club?
- What does it do?

185
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,960
The international club members must know
how to introduce us in many languages...

186
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,596
and communicate with our fans globally.

187
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,032
- That's totally me!
- That's totally me!

188
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,000
I volunteer.

189
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,001
I want to join.

190
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,602
Me too, then.

191
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,515
(Getting competitive again)

192
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,306
Why? Because your name is A-NA?

193
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,243
Yes, that,
and I look like an exotic beauty.

194
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,079
That confidence!

195
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,981
You must be confident!

196
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,283
- You're beautiful! Be confident!
- Thank you!

197
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,751
Are you sure?

198
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,154
What are you?

199
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,122
(A human heart)

200
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,990
Are you sure?

201
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,392
(Heart headband)

202
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,428
(Taking all heart props)

203
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,430
(I'm all hearts!)

204
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,931
You must be in the comedy club.

205
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,967
(The president of the comedy club)

206
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,135
Can you even see properly?

207
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,436
Everything must look red.

208
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,271
The world is pink!

209
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
I feel so happy!

210
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,475
(IAN isn't interested
in the international club.)

211
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,110
Who wants to join the club?

212
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,946
- Raise your hands!
- Everyone except JUUN and IAN.

213
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,248
- JUUN, why aren't you more confident?
- Where's your confidence?

214
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,649
- Come on!
- Be confident!

215
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,085
I don't think I can join the club.

216
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,055
Sorry, but appearance-wise,
you look the most international.

217
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,923
- That's true.
- You look exotic!

218
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,424
- Come here!
- Your hair color!

219
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,726
I feel so much more confident now!
I'm signing up!

220
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,262
- Let's go!
- Yes, girl!

221
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,364
- Good job!
- Good job.

222
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,533
Everyone will take turns
to vouch for themselves.

223
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,901
Introduce yourselves in English.

224
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,269
I'll go first.

225
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,839
Gorgeous and sassy girl!

226
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,309
As you all may know,
I'm from Vancouver, Canada.

227
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,079
And that's why I'm honored to be
your representative.

228
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,148
So, you guys have to vote for me, okay?

229
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,416
- Okay.
- Okay!

230
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,518
- A-NA, you got that, right?
- Yes!

231
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
- Interpret it for us.
- Yes, let's hear it.

232
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,055
- "Hello, I'm STELLA."
- I didn't say that.

233
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,124
I didn't introduce my name.

234
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,727
Who's next? CARMEN?

235
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,597
- Go, CARMEN.
- Let's hear from you, CARMEN.

236
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,200
- I can speak English and Indonesian.
- You're trilingual!

237
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,803
- I've already won.
- Let's hear it.

238
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,905
Hello, my name is CARMEN.

239
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,473
Hello, my name is CARMEN.

240
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,941
Hello, my name is CARMEN.

241
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,113
- We can say that much too!
- We can do that too!

242
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,480
I can speak 20 languages
if that's all I need to say!

243
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,616
I had to keep things simple.

244
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,052
But we know how good you are,

245
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,621
so let's just hear you say
"I love you" to our fans.

246
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,889
I love you, everyone!

247
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,492
We have to approve her.

248
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,159
- That was cool.
- JUUN, let's hear from you.

249
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,295
(Feeling the pressure)

250
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,230
- Let's go, blonde!
- Be confident!

251
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,998
- You can do it!
- Be confident!

252
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,403
- Let your blonde hair speak!
- Yes!

253
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,069
- Be confident!
- You look like a foreigner.

254
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,040
I belong to the international club
just because of my looks.

255
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,209
- Of course!
- Say that in English.

256
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,144
Please!

257
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,080
(She's so cute!)

258
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,482
- Our tofu.
- Is that okay?

259
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,384
- YUHA.
- Next!

260
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,652
- Attention, please!
- Okay.

261
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,553
All right.

262
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,291
- Is that all?
- What was that?

263
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:53,626
Let's see.

264
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,828
Hi, guys.

265
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,129
Hi.

266
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,030
Hello!

267
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,267
(Suddenly switching to Japanese)

268
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,335
Thank you! Bye!

269
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,737
- Among everyone...
- Good job!

270
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,372
- you were the best!
- I spoke the most languages!

271
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,607
- You nailed it!
- "Hello!"

272
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,808
That was impressive.

273
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,778
But I can't do it. I'm out.

274
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,613
Should we vote now?

275
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,747
- That sounds good.
- Let's do that.

276
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,850
Hands up for STELLA. CARMEN.

277
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,385
JUUN. YUHA.

278
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:24,389
STELLA and CARMEN will be
in the international club.

279
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,791
(STELLA and CARMEN are
in the international club.)

280
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,694
(H2H School Club Members)

281
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,530
(International Club: CARMEN and STELLA)

282
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:32,764
Next is the gaming club.

283
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,201
They must be the life of the party
to hype everything up.

284
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,069
Right on!

285
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,071
They must be good at games,
humorous, and also have fun tricks.

286
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,407
They must be multi-talented.

287
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,608
- That's me!
- It's totally me!

288
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,776
- That's me!
- I'm exactly that!

289
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,144
- I know how to have fun.
- That's me.

290
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,680
I want to recommend someone.

291
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,047
- Who?
- Who is it?

292
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,118
As you can see on the outside,

293
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,285
IAN is the perfect fit.

294
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,286
That's true.

295
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,954
Please, IAN!

296
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,056
She's the perfect fit.

297
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,125
Who belongs in the gaming club
more than me?

298
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,794
- That's true.
- I agree.

299
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,129
- Yes.
- Show us your Doraemon impression.

300
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,231
Okay, let me cover myself first.

301
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,967
(Turning into Doraemon)

302
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,568
Jin Gu!

303
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,970
Vote for me for the gaming club!

304
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,340
- What was that?
- That was a bit...

305
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,109
I'm the clear winner for this.

306
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,212
I want to recommend A-NA.

307
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,681
- Right.
- Yes! I'm the perfect fit.

308
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,018
A-NA should show us a trick too.

309
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,118
- Show us.
- Let's see it.

310
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,619
Show us your freestyle dancing!

311
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,222
- Good one!
- Will you vote for me, then?

312
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,056
Of course!

313
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,392
Let's go!

314
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,430
(Hyping up the audience
in a dolphin pitch)

315
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,664
- Let's go!
- She's in the middle.

316
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,432
- Count for us, IAN!
- Count!

317
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,602
In 5, 6, 7, 8!

318
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,170
(The beatboxing is a bonus.)

319
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,705
(Sneaking about)

320
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,641
(She's a chicken pecking its feed.)

321
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,109
(Breaking down the beat
and snapping her joints)

322
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,811
(Going past her stage)

323
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,781
You're so good!

324
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,416
(Oh, my.)

325
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,652
(The beat is getting faster.)

326
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,622
(In the zone)

327
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,658
(Even turning her dancing into humor)

328
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,660
- That was so good!
- You nailed it.

329
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,161
You were amazing!

330
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,797
- Great job.
- Thank you!

331
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,532
I'm out.

332
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,500
Do you have any tricks to share?

333
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,969
Tricks? I can imitate
the sound of water dripping.

334
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,404
All right.

335
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,208
(Water dripping)

336
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,976
How was it?

337
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,312
- JUUN, show yours!
- Let's see it!

338
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,548
Only I can do this.

339
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,550
- What is it?
- I love the confidence!

340
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,586
JIWOO, you have to give me the order.

341
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,287
Right.

342
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,022
(JUUN acting like an NPC)

343
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,957
(Character name: JUUN)

344
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,891
JUUN!

345
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,260
(JUUN has been summoned.)

346
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,262
Yes.

347
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,363
(Lightly bouncing)

348
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,332
Wave at me.

349
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,800
(JUUN has been summoned to wave.)

350
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,235
(Waving)

351
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,170
(Acting like an NPC from head to toe)

352
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,772
(Totally falling for it)

353
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,141
(Fascinated)

354
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,376
There's an enemy ahead!

355
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,212
(Startled)

356
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,647
You must shoot!

357
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,616
(Input error)

358
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,284
(Momentarily logging out into reality)

359
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,118
You can do it!

360
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,219
Get over it!

361
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,457
(Taking her gun out to shoot)

362
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,024
(Even mimicking the recoil)

363
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,129
(Impressed)

364
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,197
That was so good!

365
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,432
(In awe of her impressive trick)

366
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,135
- Thank you!
- Even your "thank you" was perfect!

367
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,270
- Let's vote now.
- Okay.

368
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,273
(How did the voting go?)

369
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,976
A-NA and IAN are in the gaming club.

370
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,278
- Congratulations!
- I knew it!

371
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,646
Gaming club!

372
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,783
(Gaming Club: A-NA and IAN)

373
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,084
What the mental health club will do!

374
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:45,524
First, they'll always be sure
to offer comforting words.

375
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,329
They'll also be heart protectors
always to keep your heart warm.

376
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,696
- What?
- Heart protectors?

377
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,299
(That sounds cool!)

378
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,601
Let's recommend people. I recommend YUHA.

379
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,436
I recommend JUUN.

380
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:02,041
Yes, JUUN always listens to our problems.
She's also very kind.

381
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,379
I agree. I've never seen anyone
as kind as JUUN.

382
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,647
You know how soft she is.

383
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,949
- Right.
- She's our soft tofu.

384
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,452
- She's our soft tofu.
- Yes, our kind JUUN.

385
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,287
JIWOO, why did you recommend YUHA?

386
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,089
Why?

387
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,826
I spent many trainee days with you,

388
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,228
so I know better than anyone
that you have a kind heart.

389
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,329
You should also say something.

390
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,666
Yes, YUHA is great at caring for others...

391
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,080
and has such a strong mindset.

392
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,104
She always reassures us...

393
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,973
- when we're struggling.
- She keeps us strong.

394
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:34,807
I agree.

395
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,108
I'll join the mental health club, then!

396
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,409
- Okay!
- That sounds good.

397
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,944
I also want to join
the mental health club.

398
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:39,945
I like it too.

399
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,313
- Congratulations!
- JUUN and YUHA!

400
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,381
Congratulations!

401
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,650
Let's go, JUUN and YUHA!

402
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,219
(Mental Health Club: JUUN and YUHA)

403
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,989
(First Period: the Student Government)

404
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,757
Let us introduce ourselves properly.

405
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,160
We're the student government members
of H2H School,

406
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,029
- JIWOO...
- And YE-ON.

407
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,900
As the student government,
we've prepared this time...

408
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,002
to decide on the school rules.

409
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,070
Nice!

410
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,171
That's important.

411
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,008
We need rules to respect and follow...

412
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,377
for a happy school year together.

413
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,181
Let's share some ideas and set some rules.

414
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,183
- That sounds good.
- It's exciting.

415
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,585
- I'll go first.
- Sure.

416
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,421
Many of us love to sleep in.

417
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,857
- Who?
- Who are they?

418
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,324
Do I really need to name names?

419
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,594
(Snitching on someone)

420
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,028
- Really?
- We don't know everyone.

421
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:30,996
- I don't know.
- I agree.

422
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:31,964
I have no idea who they are.

423
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,999
Everyone, other than CARMEN and YE-ON,

424
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,468
tends to be sleepyheads.

425
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,470
- That's true.
- Right.

426
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,206
What penalty should we have
for being late?

427
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,174
Let's decide.

428
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,742
- For being late?
- For being late?

429
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,243
If we're late...

430
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,647
Get as many kisses from JIWOO
as the number of minutes you're late.

431
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,316
I can't stand that!

432
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,217
That sounds good!

433
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,320
(What about my opinion?)

434
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,221
Don't do that!

435
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,557
Get kisses from JIWOO and YE-ON
on both cheeks.

436
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,660
(It's a penalty for JIWOO either way.)

437
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,661
- I'm fine if it's YE-ON.
- That sounds nice.

438
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,129
I'm happy either way.

439
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,340
I'd like to veto it.

440
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,076
(She immediately returns
to her clerk duties.)

441
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,435
(How cute.)

442
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,302
I think that'd work better for me.

443
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,771
It'll help solidify our teamwork.

444
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,772
- Right.
- I like it.

445
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:14,806
How about this, then?

446
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:18,000
How about coming in early to clean up?

447
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,212
That way, our classroom will be cleaner,

448
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,548
- I like it.
- and it's a better way...

449
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,018
to compose ourselves
rather than giving penalties.

450
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:30,922
If that's the case, how about cleaning
for a week if you're late?

451
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,190
- Okay.
- Good.

452
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,525
- I love the idea.
- Okay.

453
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,262
(Rules of H2H School: Morning cleaning
for a week if you're late.)

454
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,866
What about assigning the worst seat
in the car to the latecomer?

455
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,968
- I like it.
- That sounds awesome!

456
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,603
I have a lot to say about this.

457
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,472
What is it?

458
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,607
Some of us live
in the same building, right?

459
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,357
(Building A: JIWOO, YUHA, IAN, and YE-ON,)

460
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:51,043
(Building B: CARMEN, STELLA, JUUN,
and A-NA)

461
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,244
(Those living in the same building
take the same car.)

462
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,115
I bet JIWOO has no idea
because she always gets the front seat.

463
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,153
- The rest of us!
- The three of us. YE-ON...

464
00:16:58,178 --> 00:16:59,751
always stalls at the elevator
to avoid the back seat.

465
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,152
- No, I don't!
- YE-ON!

466
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,054
- No, I don't.
- YE-ON!

467
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,799
- That's not true.
- You got caught!

468
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,425
(They're ganging up on the youngest.)

469
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,860
YE-ON refuses
to get off the elevator and...

470
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,396
Actually, she lets us sit up front
these days.

471
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,232
I've been stuck in the back
for five days straight.

472
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,968
Every time, YE-ON subtly nudged me.

473
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,306
- Really?
- YE-ON pushed me so I'd sit in the back.

474
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,175
Does YE-ON do that on your team?
JUUN does the same!

475
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,243
YE-ON and JUUN!

476
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,911
JUUN does that too!

477
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,547
JUUN gets off the elevator
without issue...

478
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,549
but she slows down,
remembering the back seat.

479
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,751
(Laughing)

480
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,852
You didn't know, right, JIWOO?

481
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,954
- No.
- We didn't know.

482
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,423
CARMEN and I had no idea.

483
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,823
Let's hear JUUN out first.

484
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,191
I'm working very hard on it.

485
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,726
It's true. She's improving.

486
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,297
All right. YE-ON, your turn.

487
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,266
Speaking for myself,

488
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,634
I must say it's not true
that I pushed anyone.

489
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,837
- Okay.
- What about stalling at the elevator?

490
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,373
I didn't do it on purpose.

491
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,140
- I was trying to hold the door.
- Haven't you ever done that?

492
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,309
No.

493
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,444
Did you ever mean to do it?

494
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,212
I have once.

495
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,617
Then, if you're late,
you should clean in the morning.

496
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,452
Let's also set a rule for car seats.

497
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,054
- Okay.
- Good idea.

498
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,022
- Okay.
- Good.

499
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,857
I suggest our team play
rock-paper-scissors.

500
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,193
- Okay.
- All right.

501
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,728
Let's play it in the elevator
right before we get into the car.

502
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,796
Okay.

503
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,166
Hold on. If the other team plays
rock-paper-scissors...

504
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,669
and we don't, it'll hurt my pride.

505
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,036
Let's make it more fun.

506
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,070
Like what?

507
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,106
How about the hunch game?

508
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:28,940
Okay.

509
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:31,890
Not always, but we can when we remember.

510
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,344
- Good idea.
- Good.

511
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,748
So, decide on seats by playing
rock-paper-scissors or the hunch game.

512
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,249
- Okay.
- Good.

513
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,218
Now, let's talk about meals.

514
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,954
Let's decide how to pick the menu.

515
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,624
- I have a lot to say about this.
- It's really important!

516
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,961
Honestly, it's the most important issue
for me.

517
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:52,406
How about always getting
ricotta cheese sandwiches for lunch?

518
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,933
- No more ricotta cheese sandwiches!
- You need to quit suggesting that!

519
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,835
I'm kind of sick of them.

520
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,470
To be honest, I don't even like them.

521
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,573
You guys! You said you enjoyed it!

522
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:02,874
I did because you chose it.

523
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,376
I did because I had to.

524
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,479
I think we should go by majority rule.

525
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,748
- I agree.
- Since there are eight of us...

526
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,216
- Right.
- The majority rule works for me.

527
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,852
- Okay.
- I'd like to add a condition.

528
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:18,137
You can't order the same thing
two days in a row.

529
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,960
JIWOO, can we make it three days?

530
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,196
Can you really eat the same thing
two days straight?

531
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,598
Why not? I could eat
the same thing for a week.

532
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,800
I can for six weeks.

533
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,703
How many of us can eat
the same thing two days in a row?

534
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,571
I'm fine with two days.

535
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,839
I'm fine with it.

536
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,141
- I can, but...
- Me too.

537
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,545
Okay, then. Two days is fine.

538
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,446
Okay.

539
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,182
- But not three days.
- No same menu three days in a row.

540
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:44,983
Yes.

541
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,051
YE-ON, you can do it.

542
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,754
Thank you so much, YE-ON.

543
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,388
You're welcome.

544
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,956
I knew you were kind, YE-ON.

545
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,391
Let's go, soft tofu!

546
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,994
Anything else about dorm life?

547
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,195
STELLA!

548
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,431
Don't fall asleep in the bathtub.

549
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,169
- Please.
- I'm begging you.

550
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,705
But... A-NA.

551
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,074
Don't fall asleep on the floor!

552
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,175
A-NA, stop falling asleep on the couch!

553
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,644
A-NA, stop falling asleep on the couch
and making me wake you up,

554
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,813
then whining about it when I do!

555
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,249
(Rule Two: Sleep in your rooms.)

556
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,216
Okay.

557
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,220
The other team seems
to have way more problems.

558
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,990
- JIWOO, our room is peaceful!
- I love us so much.

559
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,058
I'm glad we're both messy.

560
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,994
(Laughing)

561
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,631
We can apply these rules
to everyone, right?

562
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,532
- Yes.
- Okay.

563
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,836
YE-ON, don't you have anything
to say to IAN?

564
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,072
Actually, our room is peaceful.

565
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,172
You're lying.

566
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,740
We're at peace.

567
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,309
Are you a robot?

568
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,080
It seems we've discussed every issue.

569
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,782
I like these new rules.

570
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,984
Are you sure there's nothing else?

571
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,254
I think we can keep this peace
if we stay the way we are.

572
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,256
I'm very satisfied with our roommateship.

573
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,692
Well, except for YE-ON forgetting
to close the bathroom door...

574
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,228
and forgetting to turn off the lights
and snooze alarms.

575
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,562
Otherwise, I'm happy with her.

576
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,696
I'll try harder.

577
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,733
Thank you.

578
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,337
Now that we've set new rules...

579
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,271
let's stick to them and keep the peace.

580
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,239
- Good.
- Okay.

581
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,575
(The student government set
the new rules.)

582
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,259
(Rules of H2H)

583
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:19,246
(1. Morning cleaning for a week
if you're late.)

584
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:20,311
(2. Decide seats by playing
rock-paper-scissors or the hunch game.)

585
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,414
Next up is the international club!
You have an agenda, right?

586
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,348
Please come forward.

587
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,985
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, everyone.

588
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,758
Hi, everyone. Welcome
to the international club's meeting!

589
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,596
We've prepared something fun
and meaningful for today.

590
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,897
Let's all enjoy it together!

591
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,133
Are you all ready?

592
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,233
- Yes!
- Yes!

593
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,203
We've got a game
to boost your language skills!

594
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,738
(What game did
the international club prepare?)

595
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:47,939
What's the game?

596
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,942
(Drumroll)

597
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,777
"Guess the Drama..."

598
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,446
- "in Foreign Language!"
- "In Foreign Language!"

599
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,315
Everyone, please give a round of applause!

600
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,753
That sounds interesting!

601
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,523
You'll do great
with just a little bit of wit.

602
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,001
("Guess the Drama in a Foreign Language")

603
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,559
(Prepared by the international club)

604
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,261
CARMEN will act out a famous scene...

605
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,698
from a Korean drama or movie
but in Indonesian.

606
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,867
If no one can guess it,
I'll perform it again in English.

607
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,837
You'll have to guess the lines
and the title of the scene.

608
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,305
- Okay.
- Got it.

609
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,174
- Give us your best performance, okay?
- Show us your best performance.

610
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,442
I'm excited to see this!

611
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,111
All right. Here we go.

612
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,313
(The two stand facing each other.)

613
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,347
Is it a romantic drama?

614
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,250
- I'll stand here. Remember the thing?
- Oh, right.

615
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,553
I guess they are a couple.

616
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,322
You must take the performance seriously.

617
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,957
(Scene One in Indonesian and English)

618
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,726
"Did you say 600 years old?"

619
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,796
"You can't win. You agree, right?"

620
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,165
"I'm going to eat your earrings."

621
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,135
(Mouthing)

622
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,105
What is that?

623
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,641
- They're eating something.
- She said earrings.

624
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:57,576
Right.

625
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,976
I'm going to eat your earrings?

626
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,780
(I'm going to eat your earrings?)

627
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,548
JIWOO!

628
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,016
I got it!

629
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,351
"Hotel del Luna!"

630
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,453
Hotel?

631
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,489
Isn't that the drama
where Taeyeon sang the OST?

632
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,156
- What were the lines again?
- The lines.

633
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,659
It's the scene
where they're eating rice cake soup.

634
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,962
- Oh, right!
- The rice cake soup! Earrings!

635
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:18,865
"I'm 600 years old."

636
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,665
"I'm 360 and more."

637
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,666
That's right!

638
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,934
"I'm going to win."

639
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,136
"I'm even going to eat your earrings up."

640
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,404
- What?
- That's correct.

641
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,174
She's so good.

642
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,274
Thank you.

643
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,143
You're good at this, JIWOO.

644
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:33,912
Next quiz.

645
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,114
I'm getting competitive now.

646
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,983
Here I go. I'm going to get this one.

647
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,218
(Scene Two in Indonesian)

648
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,286
You're eating something again?

649
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:44,456
No.

650
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,589
What's ttojungyi?

651
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,761
(So sad)

652
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,030
"Kaochuzugu?"

653
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,932
"Kaopuchuchu?"

654
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,300
Yes. That's it.

655
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,469
Why did you sound so sad?

656
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,869
Because the scene is sad.

657
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,238
(Her performance was so moving.)

658
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,740
- Can you show us in English?
- Okay.

659
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,741
I'm sitting.

660
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,046
"Do Jun."

661
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,948
I'll answer.
"Do I have the face of a king?"

662
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,652
- No.
- Incorrect.

663
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,855
(She couldn't guess
the right answer again.)

664
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,390
"Do Jun."

665
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,659
"He is my grandchild."

666
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,028
Who is To Jun?

667
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,129
Grandchild?

668
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,499
I know! That's from that!

669
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
You're right!

670
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,770
That one!

671
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,305
- Yes! That's the one.
- He's on this drama.

672
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,705
I really know what this is.

673
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,041
(Laughing)

674
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,508
I'm serious. I definitely know this.

675
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,577
Isn't it that one? I mean...

676
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,078
Inheriting something and...

677
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,447
- That's right!
- You're right!

678
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,482
Please!

679
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,916
Please!

680
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,251
What's that?

681
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:48,954
Grandson!

682
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,055
- You're right!
- "Grandson is that thing."

683
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,959
I think "Grandson" is on the title.

684
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,161
JIWOO! "Reborn Rich."

685
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,329
That's it.

686
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,499
(So that was the title.)

687
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,467
What's the line?

688
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,236
So... Seo Jun?

689
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,639
I'll answer! "Reborn Rich."

690
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,074
The title is "Reborn Rich."

691
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,276
No! Please!

692
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,978
"Do Jun is my grandson."

693
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,746
That's right!

694
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,716
(Fairy Detective finally got
the answer right.)

695
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,150
- A-NA got one point!
- She got a point!

696
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,318
That was close.

697
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,252
Please go on.

698
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,021
This is so fun.

699
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,589
- Next quiz.
- Here's another one.

700
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,159
(Fully focused)

701
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,260
Here I go.

702
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,029
First...

703
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,197
Are you at a restaurant again?

704
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,497
They're eating again?

705
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,767
(Scene Three in Indonesian and English)

706
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:36,901
"This is so good."

707
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,135
"Did you go to the mart?"

708
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,104
- I know!
- I know!

709
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,240
We are not done yet.

710
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,308
Okay. You have to finish.

711
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,444
(This scene is bringing out
everyone's competitive side.)

712
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,579
"Did you go to the mart?"

713
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,718
"Pumpkin sweet potato."

714
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,923
"Pumpkin sweet pota..."

715
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,161
That's the end.

716
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:05,219
- YUHA!
- IAN!

717
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,630
YUHA.

718
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,799
I'll act out with her.

719
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,801
"This is so good."

720
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,436
"Did you go to the mart?"

721
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,905
"No, Young-gi's mom got it
from her field...

722
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,940
"Pumpkin... Pumpkin potato..."

723
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,617
"No, it's pumpkin sweet potato."

724
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,878
"Yes, I said it.
Pumpkin potato... I mean..."

725
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,724
"Pumpkin sweet potato."

726
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,116
"Yes! Pumpkin sweet potato!"

727
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,919
(What a masterpiece performance.)

728
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,254
You did a great job!

729
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,722
Okay. What's the title?

730
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,156
"High Kick Through the Roof."

731
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,325
No, that's not it.

732
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,527
Fail.

733
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:37,786
- IAN!
- What do you mean by fail?

734
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,597
- Isn't it "High Kick Through the Roof?"
- What did I do?

735
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:41,833
IAN!

736
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,668
"High Kick!"

737
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,336
(Courtesy of JUUN: In shock)

738
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,804
(Courtesy of YUHA: Silly)

739
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,506
I can't believe it was "High Kick!"

740
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,676
Tell us the lines properly.

741
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,944
You need to act out.

742
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,080
"Did you go to the mart?"

743
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:59,950
"No, Young-gi's mom
got me this pumpkin pota..."

744
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,487
"Mother, it's pumpkin sweet potato."

745
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,622
"I said pumpkin po..."

746
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,923
"Pumpkin sweet potato."

747
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,258
I'm right, right?

748
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,327
No. YUHA!

749
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,229
Why not?

750
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,696
- You have to finish.
- Until the end.

751
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,464
You have to act out the whole scene.

752
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,965
Hold on! The whole scene?

753
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,301
(She fails.)

754
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,635
- YUHA.
- Go ahead.

755
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:18,962
The title is "High Kick!"

756
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,040
"This is so good. Did you go to the mart?"

757
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,077
"No, Young-gi's mom got it
from her field. Potato pumpkin..."

758
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,979
"You mean pumpkin sweet potato, right?"

759
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,581
"Yes! I said pumpkin po... I mean..."

760
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,116
"Pumpkin sweet potato."

761
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,620
"Pumpkin sweet potato! Are you happy now?"

762
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,290
(YUHA nails it!)

763
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,092
She's so good.

764
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,828
- That was a perfect answer.
- That was awesome.

765
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,964
- How does she know all those lines?
- Tell me about it.

766
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,032
YUHA got one point!

767
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,134
We are at the bottom.

768
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,802
Let's try our best.

769
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,272
Everyone, bring your A-game.

770
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:55,873
Next scene!

771
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,042
It's so much fun to watch them act.

772
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,344
It's really fun to watch it.

773
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,512
In Indonesian, first.

774
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,348
- We need to be serious.
- Be serious.

775
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,082
(Calming down)

776
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,790
Is that all? Only one line?

777
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:14,459
Yes. That's it.

778
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,629
(Scene Four in English)

779
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:21,132
"Miss, you have to believe me."

780
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,399
I'll answer!

781
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,869
(Screaming)

782
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,971
- That's it!
- You got it!

783
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,305
YUHA!

784
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,607
Give me a second.

785
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,108
What is it?

786
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,111
(She stands up again.)

787
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,781
- Please.
- No! I mean...

788
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,083
(You can do it, YUHA!)

789
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,117
I know you know it.

790
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,218
"SKY Castle."

791
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,022
That's correct!

792
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:44,555
"Ma'am. You have
to believe me completely."

793
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,857
- Yes!
- Yes!

794
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,693
(She's insanely good.)

795
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,261
I knew it so well!

796
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:53,397
- YUHA got two points now!
- YUHA suddenly became so good at it!

797
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,066
She's now leading with two points!

798
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,537
YE-ON, JUUN, and IAN! What are you doing?

799
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,640
You need to think more globally.

800
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:05,076
I'm trying my best,
but those two are so good!

801
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,510
We'll try harder.

802
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:07,545
Next scene.

803
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,882
(What famous scene
will they act out this time?)

804
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,617
(Laughing)

805
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,751
- What?
- What's going on?

806
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,352
Is the scene kind of clingy?

807
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,821
Okay. My heart skipped a beat.

808
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,824
My heart is racing.

809
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:20,892
Your heart skipped a beat?

810
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,260
Her heart is racing?

811
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,862
(Scene Five in Indonesian)

812
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,196
(Cute)

813
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:29,634
(Winking)

814
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,902
- "I love you" and wink, right?
- I know.

815
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,570
- I know. YUNA!
- JIWOO!

816
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,605
- JIWOO!
- A-NA!

817
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,240
- A-NA.
- Your name, please.

818
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,675
JIWOO.

819
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,578
"Guardian: The Lonely and Great God."

820
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,713
"Shin, I'm going to marry you."

821
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,682
- That's it!
- Yes!

822
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,284
"I've thought about it a lot,
and I think I'm your bride."

823
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,053
"Shin, I love you."

824
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,188
(What a romantic "I love you.")

825
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,390
- That's correct!
- Perfect.

826
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:54,659
Correct.

827
00:29:56,396 --> 00:29:58,996
- She's so good.
- She's good.

828
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,898
I even understood "I love you"
in Indonesian.

829
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,833
You really did.

830
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,402
(The hint fairy is too generous.)

831
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,205
It's the last quiz.

832
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,807
JIWOO and YUHA are tied.

833
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,709
It's neck-and-neck.

834
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,577
Let's do this!

835
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,045
(Who will win this game?)

836
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,347
(Final Scene in Indonesian)

837
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,218
(Laughing)

838
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,487
Sorry?

839
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,123
"Seru baget?"

840
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,792
Doesn't it mean "it's interesting?"

841
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,828
(That's correct!)

842
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,996
Well done!

843
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,698
She smiled and kept talking.

844
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,567
Now show us the English version.

845
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,869
(Moving)

846
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,439
(Leaning against the wall)

847
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,073
JIWOO!

848
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,643
Hold on.

849
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,179
That one. It's that one!

850
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,649
- I mean...
- What is it?

851
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,085
I mean, Satans...

852
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,987
That's right!

853
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,789
(Everyone screams hearing the keyword!)

854
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,925
YUHA!

855
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:05,087
"Lucifer himself shows up
at the school of Satans."

856
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,296
So the title is?

857
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:07,498
Give me a second.

858
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,100
"The..."

859
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,435
"The Heirs."

860
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,225
(Title: "The Heirs")

861
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:13,470
(Line: "Lucifer himself shows up
at the school of Satans.")

862
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,406
All I did was lean against the wall.

863
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,009
What was the exact line again?

864
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,644
"Lucifer himself shows up
at the school of Satans."

865
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,547
"Things will get interesting."

866
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,915
That's amazing!

867
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,950
The winner of this game is JIWOO!

868
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:31,923
I'm jealous.

869
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:33,658
JIWOO from the student government
is truly good.

870
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,860
Congrats, JIWOO!

871
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:39,263
(The final winner of "Guess the Drama
in Foreign Language" is JIWOO.)

872
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:41,726
What are we going to do
at the mental health club meeting?

873
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,002
(It's the mental health club's turn
to heal everyone's soul!)

874
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,705
It's the mental health club's time.

875
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,966
Today, we've prepared some fun
and easy personality tests!
