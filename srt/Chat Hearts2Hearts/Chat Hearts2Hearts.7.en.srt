1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,733
In Round Two of the group mission,

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,700
you'll play "The Silent Challenge."

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,733
(Make some noise!)

4
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:07,833
"The Silent Challenge?"

5
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,733
That sounds fun!

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
(Mission Two: "The Silent Challenge")

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
("Relay Pictionary")

8
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,400
(It's a relay mission...)

9
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,266
(in which they must only use actions...)

10
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,400
(to describe keywords,
including challenge-related ones.)

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,833
(They succeed if the last person
guesses the keyword correctly.)

12
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,023
(They can win food
by getting eight right.)

13
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,366
That sounds hard.

14
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:26,566
We have to do well.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,666
Why don't we make YUHA guess the word?

16
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,600
- She's familiar with dramas and K-pop.
- Okay.

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,333
(They've chosen the best gamer
for the last person,)

18
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,400
(as she must be clever.)

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,133
The starting person is important too.

20
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,933
- Let's have...
- Let's make JUUN go first.

21
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,933
- JUUN can be the starter.
- Okay.

22
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,500
JUUN, the dance master.

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,133
(The first person must be a good actress.)

24
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,913
JUUN can go first, then IAN.

25
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:46,766
That sounds good.

26
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,833
YE-ON can go next.

27
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,666
I want to be in the middle.

28
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,366
You can go next, and I'll go after you.

29
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,300
Then, CARMEN, you, and YUHA.

30
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,766
- Okay!
- Okay.

31
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,433
Stand in the order, starting with JUUN.

32
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,533
I'm terrified.

33
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,333
Just copy exactly what I do.

34
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,800
Exactly what you do.

35
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
- I won't miss any details.
- Right on.

36
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,700
Good luck to us.

37
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,733
(H2H's order for "The Silent Challenge")

38
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,866
Make sure to pass on the message well.

39
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,600
Our beef is on the line!

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Beef!

41
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,248
Copy the exact moves
when you don't know what the word is.

42
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,866
It can be a drama title
or a challenge-related word.

43
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:24,300
Copy the exact moves.

44
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,400
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,733
- Make good guesses!
- For beef!

46
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,866
(Here's the first keyword.)

47
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,700
("The Ombrinho Challenge")

48
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,433
(It's about the excited shoulders.)

49
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:38,366
(The perfect keyword for the dance master)

50
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,033
(Dancing with such confident shoulders)

51
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,366
(She got it.)

52
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:43,433
Okay!

53
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,533
(Come on, YE-ON!)

54
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,833
(This is fun!)

55
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,366
(She got it right away...)

56
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,500
(by watching
her excited shoulder dancing.)

57
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,566
(The youngest one's dancing shoulders...)

58
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,200
(are making the next one dance too.)

59
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,233
(The first few are dancing away,)

60
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,400
(while the later ones are so calm.)

61
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,166
(The shoulder move has been
safely delivered...)

62
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,833
(to the second-last person.)

63
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,200
(She got it.)

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,466
(Edgy JIWOO)

65
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,633
(Dancing her heart out for beef)

66
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,666
Wait. What is this called?

67
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,866
(Already getting confused)

68
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,200
- You know it!
- What's the challenge?

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,033
Please!

70
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:20,966
- The name!
- In 1, 2, 3!

71
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:21,966
Ombrinho?

72
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,066
(Of course, she knows it!)

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,500
That's right!

74
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,600
(The meme expert proved herself.)

75
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
I almost called it "Oompa Loompa."

76
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,166
We can do it!

77
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Okay, I get it now.

78
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,766
You must be familiar with challenges
to win points.

79
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,800
(The second keyword is a movie title.)

80
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,833
(Movie title)

81
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,800
(Unsure)

82
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,133
(The keyword has left
the dance master flustered.)

83
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,700
(Movie title)

84
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,566
(Me)

85
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:48,500
(Glasses)

86
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
(Sad)

87
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,266
(Blinking in confusion)

88
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,766
(Unable to retrieve data)

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,900
(I sometimes wear glasses...)

90
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,400
(and cry?)

91
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,100
(She's frustrated.)

92
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,833
(Throwing her mittens off to get serious)

93
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,100
- Me.
- Me.

94
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,333
- Glasses.
- Glasses.

95
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,833
- Crying.
- Crying.

96
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,366
Copy the exact moves,
even if you don't know what they mean.

97
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:09,300
The exact moves?

98
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,933
(Will YE-ON get it?)

99
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:15,666
(Only showing three moves)

100
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,800
(YE-ON's eyes are on.)

101
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,700
(Me, glasses, sadness)

102
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,033
(Unable to decipher the moves)

103
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,300
- Something seems to be going wrong.
- I'm getting anxious.

104
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,533
It doesn't feel right.

105
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,400
Remember to copy the exact moves.

106
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,500
(Copying the exact moves)

107
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
(Copying and pasting)

108
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
(Unable to retrieve the movie title)

109
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,366
(Making her memorize the actions)

110
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,466
That's right.

111
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,233
(Me)

112
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,566
- What was next?
- Hey!

113
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,633
(A-NA is having a brain fart.)

114
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,000
(Glasses)

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,366
(Sad)

116
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,366
I must be right.

117
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,666
("Me, glasses, and sadness" are back.)

118
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,466
- Here I go.
- Okay.

119
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,166
I'll copy the exact moves.

120
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,666
(Me)

121
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,700
(Sunny girl)

122
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,300
(CARMEN has ruined the "glasses" part.)

123
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,566
("Glasses" has turned into "okay.")

124
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,033
We're doomed.

125
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,600
- I copied your moves.
- Yes, but we failed.

126
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,033
(YUHA is our last hope.)

127
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
(Will she sense the error
and get it right?)

128
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,433
(Unable to retrieve the movie title)

129
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,266
Me?

130
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,766
Right.

131
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
(No, it's not right!)

132
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,300
Me.

133
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,266
Okay!

134
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,500
And crying?

135
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,566
(It's not okay!)

136
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,766
(Glasses!)

137
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,633
Me.

138
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,900
(Unable to detect the movie title)

139
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,400
Okay.

140
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,466
What's the movie title?

141
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:42,733
I have no idea.

142
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,433
It's "Inside Out."

143
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,966
(How is it "Inside Out?")

144
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,266
"I'm wearing glasses and crying."

145
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,500
What does that mean?

146
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,466
This was what I meant.

147
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,633
"I, JUUN,"

148
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,033
"become Sadness with my glasses on."

149
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,700
Why would you describe it like that?

150
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,466
You should've acted out
the different emotions.

151
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,566
Or inside and out, like this.

152
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,100
Okay.

153
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,233
Here we go.

154
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,066
(They must get seven more right.)

155
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,433
Next is a drama title.

156
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,566
- Dramas are hard.
- That sounds challenging.

157
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,600
- Act out each word in the title.
- All right.

158
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,633
(Can they work together?)

159
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,833
(Drama title: "Queen of Tears")

160
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,633
I'll literally act out the title.

161
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:28,666
(Drama title: "Queen of Tears")

162
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,766
(The explanation has gotten much clearer.)

163
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:32,933
(Did you see it?)

164
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:33,866
(Off you go.)

165
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,200
(Tears)

166
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,433
(Queen)

167
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,533
(Updating)

168
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,533
(The type to capture actions
with her eyes)

169
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,400
(Adding details to the facial expression)

170
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,833
(We're doing great!)

171
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,133
(Here's when it always gets messed up.)

172
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,400
(Tears)

173
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,387
(Sparkling)

174
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,666
(Words becoming mashed)

175
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,533
(Shutting her eyes in frustration)

176
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,566
(Will the sunny girl
deliver it correctly?)

177
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:01,600
What was that?

178
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,433
(Tears)

179
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,700
(The sunny girl likes to throw
her tears away.)

180
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,866
Please continue.

181
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,866
(Oh, goodness!)

182
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,400
Come on, CARMEN!

183
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,966
(A serious bug has been detected.)

184
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,433
(The queen is gone,
and only the tears have survived.)

185
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,033
(JIWOO seems so worried.)

186
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,100
(Throwing tears away?)

187
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,866
(Knocking)

188
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,200
I know! "Queen of Tears!"

189
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,233
(She got the answer...)

190
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,400
(just from the crying move.)

191
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,166
What? How are you so good?

192
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,266
How did you know it?

193
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,933
You're so good!

194
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,633
How did you get it?

195
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
CARMEN!

196
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,266
How did it go from this to that?

197
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:49,866
CARMEN must be a spy!

198
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,500
(The sunny girl doesn't know
what crying is.)

199
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,333
But A-NA also mashed the moves together.

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,633
I only copied her!

201
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,466
You're right. Sorry, I'm the problem.

202
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,066
We're good.

203
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,866
Let's go!

204
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,033
Please show me the word.

205
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,600
It's a song title.

206
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,466
(The dance master's expertise)

207
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,600
(Immediately dancing)

208
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,500
(Perfectly reenacting the moves)

209
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,266
(The highlights by the dance master)

210
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,266
(1. Diagonal body rolls)

211
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:23,666
(2. Flying)

212
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,666
(Keep going.)

213
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:28,400
(Diagonal body rolls and flying)

214
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:29,600
(Grinning)

215
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,966
(The youngest one got it.)

216
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:32,600
Copy the exact moves.

217
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,220
(Body rolls)

218
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,588
(Flying)

219
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:38,566
(Keeping the master's feel
and delivering the rhythm)

220
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,333
(Back in the error zone)

221
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,600
(Come on!)

222
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,566
(A-NA has an error again.)

223
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,400
What was it?

224
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,166
Please!

225
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,033
I'll copy your moves, okay?

226
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:53,700
(Second time facepalming)

227
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:56,100
Do this and that.

228
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,400
First, go like this.

229
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,866
- This?
- I don't know!

230
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,200
(Dropping her arms)

231
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,066
(She couldn't feel the rhythm.)

232
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,533
(So frustrated)

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,033
(Will they fail, just like that?)

234
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,966
(Here comes the savior...)

235
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:19,166
(to fix the error.)

236
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,566
What? Why is it different from mine?

237
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,466
(From the master's special lesson...)

238
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,633
(to a perfect finish)

239
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,566
I know!

240
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,533
- "Feel My Rhythm."
- Correct.

241
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,666
Impressive!

242
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,833
JIWOO, you saved us all!

243
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,800
You're a legend!

244
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:42,733
(Cheers to our leader!)

245
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:43,766
You're incredible!

246
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,333
- She suddenly started dancing.
- She's good.

247
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,800
You and I are carrying the team.

248
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,166
Our teamwork is incredible.

249
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,166
(The fifth keyword is a song title.)

250
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,133
(Song title: "Whiplash")

251
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,366
(Flipping her hair)

252
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,000
(Preparing the runway)

253
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,266
(We must know this!)

254
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,233
(Sure that it's "Whiplash")

255
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,066
(Knocking)

256
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:08,766
(Flipping her hair)

257
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,200
(Getting it right away)

258
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,166
(Whipping her hair)

259
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,533
(Moving so fast)

260
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,600
Yes!

261
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,733
(Immediately catching on)

262
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,366
(Still keeping it edgy)

263
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,833
I know! "Whiplash."

264
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,633
(A perfect success)

265
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,700
We're good!

266
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,033
(Animal: "Frilled lizard")

267
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:32,233
(Frills)

268
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,466
(Safely passing through the error zone)

269
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,666
Frilled lizard!

270
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,766
(A cat is...)

271
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,666
(walking...)

272
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,566
(on...)

273
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:41,300
(the frozen...)

274
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,600
(Han River.)

275
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:46,352
"A cat is walking
on the frozen Han River."

276
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,266
(Animal: "Moon bear")

277
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,933
I know! Moon bear?

278
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,100
(Getting three right in a row)

279
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,433
We're amazing at this!

280
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:58,666
Is this the last one?

281
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,333
Beef!

282
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,666
The keyword is an animal.

283
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,533
An animal?

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,566
(Animal: "Mosquito")

285
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,300
(Feeling stuck)

286
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,033
(Flying around)

287
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,100
(And poking)

288
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:14,566
(Animal: "Mosquito")

289
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,500
(A detailed description)

290
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:16,366
(What?)

291
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,500
(Flying around and poking)

292
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,300
(Adding "scratching")

293
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,533
(Flying around, poking, and itching)

294
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:22,233
(I see!)

295
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,066
(Animal: "Mosquito")

296
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,133
(Itching)

297
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:28,266
(What?)

298
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:30,800
(What's this?)

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
Copy the exact moves.

300
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,700
(YE-ON is delivering the exact actions.)

301
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,300
(Confused eyes)

302
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:41,366
(Quickly memorizing the moves)

303
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:43,900
(Neck isolation)

304
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,166
(Randomly adding neck isolation)

305
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:49,033
(Charismatic poking and itching)

306
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,033
What is this?

307
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:52,966
Why are you sighing?

308
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:54,433
(Neck isolation)

309
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,400
(A charismatic poke)

310
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,033
(The mosquito's neck has gotten flexible.)

311
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,233
(Puzzled)

312
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,800
(Two long-necked mosquitoes)

313
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,733
I'll copy you!

314
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:07,333
(Animal: "Mosquito")

315
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,100
(Charismatic but itchy)

316
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,666
(What animal could that be?)

317
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,300
(Can the problem solvers
get through this?)

318
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,833
(You get itchy when it bites you.)

319
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,866
(So focused)

320
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:23,466
Mosquito?

321
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,233
(That's correct!)

322
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,500
Correct!

323
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,000
Great job!

324
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,766
You're amazing!

325
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,700
She's so smart!

326
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,833
(She's the best.)

327
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,000
This is amazing!

328
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,000
We're too good!

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,300
I knew our teamwork was good!

330
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,100
- Beef!
- Beef!

331
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,733
(They've won...)

332
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,066
(beef and pork.)

333
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,333
Welcome to the last round, Round Three.

334
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,600
(The last mission for fruit)

335
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,433
Head into the abandoned school for it.

336
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,633
- Are we really going in there?
- No way!

337
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,400
That must be it!

338
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,500
(I love it!)

339
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,366
It's okay.

340
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:04,633
(I got your back.)

341
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:05,566
It'll be fine.

342
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,566
(Everyone knows
she's a horror movie fanatic.)

343
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,933
(IAN is her horror movie mate.)

344
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,700
(They wanted
a haunted house experience together.)

345
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
(Your wishes come true
on Chat Hearts2Hearts.)

346
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,266
(Welcome to the haunted school.)

347
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,700
You'll pair up...

348
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,433
- In pairs!
- to enter the school.

349
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,700
(Take the four classes in each classroom.)

350
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:40,500
(Everyone must finish their classes
within one hour to succeed.)

351
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,533
My gosh! I've always wanted to do this!

352
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,133
- It'll be so much fun!
- Right on!

353
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,400
(Oh, my! This is my expertise.)

354
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,433
(A scared squirrel)

355
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,866
I'm scared! I can't do this!

356
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,566
I can't go inside the school.

357
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,033
I can't stand scary things.

358
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,966
- I'll announce the pairs.
- Okay.

359
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:00,466
IAN...

360
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,566
with YE-ON.

361
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,700
That's great!

362
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,100
JUUN with YUHA.

363
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:09,600
Come to me.

364
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,766
What a relief.

365
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:12,533
JIWOO with A-NA.

366
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,800
What a relief!

367
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,333
I'll be fine with a horror fanatic.

368
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,866
No running out in the middle.

369
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,966
Nobody can run away.

370
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,833
- We need fruit.
- For fruit!

371
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,366
(Can they work together once again?)

372
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:31,000
(Time for school)

373
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,066
- Good luck!
- You can do it!

374
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:34,966
Here we go.

375
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,100
- We'll clear everything.
- Okay.

376
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,633
- Come back alive.
- Good luck!

377
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:40,766
- We have to eat fruit.
- Yes, we do!

378
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:41,700
Goodbye!

379
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,166
Hold on!

380
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,100
- Do we go up?
- This feels wrong!

381
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,933
It's okay.

382
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:49,333
(The abandoned school has
a creepy energy.)

383
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,233
(What classes await them?)

384
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,966
I said I really wanted
a haunted house experience.

385
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,200
- I'll carry JIWOO through it.
- Wait!

386
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,333
- Oh, goodness!
- Hello there.

387
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,900
- It's so scary!
- JIWOO!

388
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,466
JIWOO. You got this.

389
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,666
- Okay.
- You're turning 20 next year!

390
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:09,433
- You're right. About a month later...
- Why am I not scared at all right now?

391
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,900
I really hope they make it through.

392
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:15,266
(The two arrived
at the entrance, holding hands.)

393
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm turning 20 soon.

394
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,266
As an adult...

395
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,033
(She is startled by the camera.)

396
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,533
(Making a fuss)

397
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,700
Look at you. What a fuss.

398
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,066
JIWOO is making too much
of a ruckus about it.

399
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:30,900
(Laughing)

400
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,966
This is so scary.

401
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,100
(Why is it so dark on the way
to the classroom?)

402
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,633
(The scaredy-cat and the daredevil
started to walk in.)

403
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,066
(So close)

404
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:42,900
Well, for me...

405
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,933
Don't do it. Don't dare.

406
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,966
- I told you not to do it!
- Just don't scare me.

407
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,633
I warned you not to do it.

408
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,608
(They got to the classroom safely.)

409
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,833
- "Ping pong for P.E."
- "Ping pong for P.E."

410
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,456
(At the end of the dark hallway,
the P.E. class was waiting for them.)

411
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,100
"Use a ping pong ball to knock down
more than five cups on the other side."

412
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,533
(Knock over more than five,
and you'll win.)

413
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,633
- Ping pong?
- They're playing ping pong?

414
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:06,600
With a ping pong ball?

415
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,733
I can't play ping pong.

416
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,333
- I can't either.
- Me neither.

417
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,766
- It's easy.
- Okay.

418
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:12,900
I've never tried it before.

419
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,166
I haven't played it before either.

420
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,733
(Smashing it anyway)

421
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,500
- It's okay. We have unlimited chances.
- Right.

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,333
(How about JIWOO?)

423
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,733
(It was pretty close.)

424
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,633
(A-NA's second attempt.)

425
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,366
Sorry.

426
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,666
We're so bad at this.

427
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,966
I know.

428
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:31,633
I think you can pull it off.

429
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,333
(She tries again
now that she's got the hang of it.)

430
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,466
You knocked three over.

431
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:38,466
(With the momentum, A-NA goes for it.)

432
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:39,466
I'm sorry.

433
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,266
Oh, boy.

434
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,500
- Like this?
- You got this.

435
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,466
Right.

436
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:45,700
(Her calm attempt went down the drain.)

437
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,133
(Embarrassed)

438
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:50,366
(Whenever A-NA plays games,
something goes wrong.)

439
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,200
- You can do it!
- I'm seriously bad at this.

440
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,633
Someone is coming.

441
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,900
Someone is coming?

442
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,533
Or not.

443
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,000
(She's just as bad at this
as she is at solving mysteries.)

444
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,666
(A-NA and JIWOO's positions are swapped.)

445
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,566
(She has to play ping pong
while keeping an eye out for ghosts.)

446
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,700
(Mess)

447
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,066
(She's fighting
against something invisible.)

448
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,233
I think someone is coming!

449
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:14,866
(Flinching)

450
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,100
(Let's get this over with
before someone really comes.)

451
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:20,066
- Come on.
- How do I even do it?

452
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,333
(They have two more to go.)

453
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,233
Let's wrap this up fast and get going.

454
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:28,643
(No more acting like a scaredy-cat!
She's here to nail it.)

455
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:32,433
(She stays calm and keeps trying,
even in the middle of this mess.)

456
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,333
Just why am I so bad at this?

457
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,200
Let's switch places.

458
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,033
Okay.

459
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,600
(After the switch,)

460
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,733
(JIWOO pulls it off again.)

461
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,633
We did it.

462
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,400
Let's go.

463
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,133
(They rush to get to the second period.)

464
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,566
They got it.

465
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,933
I'll be okay as long
as nothing jumps out at me.

466
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,300
It's not as scary as I thought...

467
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,900
(Hissing)

468
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,966
Okay.

469
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,200
(One scaredy-cat becomes two.)

470
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,333
Okay.

471
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,866
Let's keep this on.

472
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,733
Okay.

473
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:09,633
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

474
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:10,866
(Camera on the second floor)

475
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,733
Let's talk before going any further.

476
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,566
What talk?

477
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,366
- Do we have to talk here?
- From what I see,

478
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:17,966
we shouldn't be afraid.

479
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:21,200
And just so you know,
I'm doing better than I expected.

480
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,066
Are you sure you're doing okay?

481
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,500
Better than expected?

482
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:25,878
- That's some bravado.
- Is she serious?

483
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:30,633
And after we complete the mission...

484
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,533
Who's there?

485
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,500
I think that's the best way.

486
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,600
(Who are you talking to?)

487
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,633
(Staring)

488
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:45,000
My reflection in the mirror freaks me out.

489
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:46,866
It's all right.

490
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,466
(Let me see.)

491
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,500
I'm scaring myself too. Oh, boy!

492
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,566
My reflection in the mirror is
the scariest!

493
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,100
I thought...

494
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,733
I'd be way more scared than this.

495
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,133
- But is it...
- But I'm fine.

496
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:00,458
Is this really an abandoned school?

497
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,366
(I am not fine.)

498
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,800
(A chill runs down their spines.)

499
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,866
- We'll go there for the fourth period.
- This is...

500
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:07,086
(Getting startled for nothing)

501
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,466
You scared me.

502
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:11,100
JIWOO, don't ever do that.

503
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:13,800
- This is... Hold on.
- So that's where...

504
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,800
- Are you sure it's this way?
- I think I'm going to be fine.

505
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,833
- Are you sure it's the direction?
- I'm sure.

506
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,266
(Anxious)

507
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,000
(All of a sudden,
the windows start rattling.)

508
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:29,033
(Frozen)

509
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,700
- What?
- No.

510
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,266
Stop.

511
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,666
I got it.

512
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,600
- Don't do it.
- I got it, okay?

513
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,666
- Stop doing that, please.
- I'm telling you.

514
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,633
- Is this for the second period?
- I told you not to do it.

515
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,733
(What class takes place
in this red-lit classroom?)

516
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:45,500
(Thud)

517
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,766
- Seriously!
- I mean...

518
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,133
(Thudding)

519
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:51,400
I got it.

520
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,466
(Is someone coming?)

521
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,066
(A red light shows up.)

522
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,633
- You scared me!
- Why did you come like that?

523
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,833
(Sorry. We are just doing our job.)

524
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,600
JIWOO, you're good at tongue twisters!

525
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,300
I'm excellent at tongue twisters.

526
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,266
(What eerie class for the second period?)

527
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:08,800
"Tongue twisters for Korean class."

528
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,800
"Read the given sentences aloud
and clearly, and express them."

529
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,966
- A tongue twister?
- They're going to do tongue twisters?

530
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,600
- JIWOO is so good at this.
- I know.

531
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,900
- Right.
- It's what she's best at.

532
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,666
(Let's warm our mouths up for it.)

533
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,766
(Let's do it together.)

534
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,633
"In the yard..."

535
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,833
- What's the heart-with-ribbon pose?
- Is this the one?

536
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,666
- The pea pods...
- What's heart-biting pose?

537
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:33,700
(You need to read the line
while following the instructions.)

538
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,400
- Are the pea pods in the yard peeled...
- Are the pea pods in the yard peeled...

539
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,800
(They hurriedly practice.)

540
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,433
- The head of Six Dong's saving book is...
- The head of Six Dong's saving book is...

541
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,033
- a yellow saving book.
- a yellow saving book.

542
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,500
The head
of Eight Dong's savings book is...

543
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,066
- a green savings book.
- A green savings book.

544
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,600
- Can I go for this one?
- Sure.

545
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,433
Are the pea pods in the yard...

546
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:56,266
Let me try it again.

547
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:59,066
Are the pea pods in the yard peeled...

548
00:19:59,066 --> 00:19:59,866
(Flinching)

549
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,300
Or not yet peeled?

550
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,466
I think someone is coming!

551
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:05,400
Don't dare come!

552
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,433
(Meanwhile, at the base camp)

553
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,266
Peeled or not yet peeled?

554
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:14,066
- Peeled or...
- Peeled or...

555
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:17,233
(Everyone is busy practicing
tongue twisters.)

556
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,300
Let me go first.

557
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,333
Ready, go.

558
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,600
Are the pea pods in the yard peeled...

559
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,000
(She failed the heart pose.)

560
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:25,333
What did I do wrong?

561
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,800
Try it again.

562
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,866
Isn't it the heart pose with kitty ears?

563
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,433
I think this is right.

564
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:31,666
What's the heart pose with kitty ears?

565
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:33,533
The kitty ears... I know!

566
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:34,700
This is it.

567
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:36,802
This is a heart-with-kitty-ears pose.

568
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:40,908
(I remember the heart pose
with kitty ears!)

569
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:43,800
- Oh, my.
- This is the heart pose with kitty ears.

570
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,900
(She learned the heart pose
with kitty ears.)

571
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,600
In the yard, peeled or not yet peeled?

572
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,366
Let's go.

573
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,400
Are the pea pods in the yard peeled...

574
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,933
or not yet peeled?

575
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:54,633
The head of Six Dong's saving book...

576
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,466
yellow...

577
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:57,966
(Throwing side eyes)

578
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,100
You said you could do it.

579
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,433
(No excuse)

580
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,833
- I need to do it again, right?
- Yellow saving book.

581
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,866
- We'll go.
- We'll go.

582
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:08,033
Are the pea pods in the yard peeled...

583
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,633
or not yet peeled?

584
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,466
The head of Six Dong's saving book is...

585
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,166
a yellow saving book.

586
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,600
The head
of Eight Dong's savings book is...

587
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,733
(I believe in you.)

588
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,866
The head
of Eight Dong's savings book is...

589
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,666
a green savings book.

590
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,533
(She did it!)

591
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,266
I think they passed.

592
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,666
They're fast.

593
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,766
It was on the right side
where the sound startled us.

594
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:34,733
I know that.

595
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,158
You're going to pop out, aren't you?

596
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,433
- Okay. Hey.
- Okay.

597
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:41,466
- Okay.
- Okay.

598
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,200
(They don't need many words
to communicate.)

599
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay.

600
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,233
(Peeking out)

601
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,966
- Okay.
- Okay.

602
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,833
(They're not acting okay.)

603
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,033
(Laughing)

604
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,600
"Okay."

605
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,466
- I got it now.
- This is getting me into trouble.

606
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:00,666
What's that?

607
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,766
- Is this to scare us?
- I think this is...

608
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,155
I think there's someone down there.

609
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,824
Is someone there?

610
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,000
I think there's a ghost here.

611
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:10,633
We're doomed.

612
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,133
I think I'm doomed.

613
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:14,733
He's there. Seriously.

614
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,800
- Are you serious?
- He's holding a white balloon.

615
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,333
Please don't do this.

616
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,200
I really think you should stop this.

617
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,900
If you stay there,
you're asking for trouble.

618
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,166
I might do something unpredictable.

619
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:28,766
Hold on. This is bad.

620
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:31,433
- What's with that white balloon?
- This is really bad.

621
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,833
Okay. I'm fine.

622
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:35,866
That's it.

623
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,366
(It's time to open Pandora's box.)

624
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:38,900
Seriously.

625
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,166
Okay. I'll open the door.

626
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,866
- For real?
- I'll do it for us.

627
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,933
- You're going to do it for me, A-NA?
- Sure.

628
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:45,733
You're so cool, A-NA.

629
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:46,933
I'm not that scared anyway.

630
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,166
You think I'm scared?

631
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,666
No way. I'm not scared at all.

632
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,766
Let's open it.

633
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:54,666
You know it's really hard
to open it, right?

634
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,733
I know.

635
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:58,266
But as soon as we open it,
that toy hammer...

636
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,433
(Hearing something)

637
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,100
- Don't do it.
- Don't.

638
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,800
- Don't do it.
- Stop.

639
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,166
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

640
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,545
(She reaches out
after the long monologue.)

641
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,933
(I can't.)

642
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,500
Okay.

643
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,033
(It suddenly opens itself.)

644
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,966
(They got scared off by the sudden move.)

645
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,866
(Frozen)

646
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,700
(Flopping down)

647
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,133
- This is...
- What was that?

648
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,200
Okay.

649
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,300
- Seriously.
- Okay.

650
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,033
"Pop the will-o'-the-wisp balloon..."

651
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,000
- "with a toy hammer."
- No way.

652
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,100
(Pop the will-o'-the-wisp balloons!)

653
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,800
(Warning:
The will-o'-the-wisp can be very fast.)

654
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,233
Are you going to be okay?
What if we hurt you?

655
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,666
(Putting up his guard
in the most helpless way)

656
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,866
(Cracking up)

657
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:46,975
Don't come!

658
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,933
I have to do what I have to do.

659
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,433
(Let's catch the will-o'-the-wisp.)

660
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,966
(A-NA is pretty good at hitting.)

661
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:56,366
- Are you okay?
- Are you really okay?

662
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,133
(Despite sounding worried,
she swings excitedly.)

663
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,266
Are you sure you're okay?

664
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,800
(Meanwhile, JIWOO is too busy laughing.)

665
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,366
Are you okay?

666
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:06,566
(The will-o'-the-wisp flop down,
exhausted.)

667
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,400
Are you okay?

668
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:09,576
(Overcoming the crisis)

669
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,000
You're okay?

670
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
(Popping)

671
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:15,566
(They manage to pop it
while asking if he's okay.)

672
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:18,100
(It gets awkward
as soon as the balloon pops.)

673
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,433
I'm so sorry.

674
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:21,400
Okay.

675
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,733
(Get out of my classroom now.)

676
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:26,766
I got it! I said I was sorry!

677
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:27,866
Sorry!

678
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,833
(They finished the fourth period
without even realizing it.)

679
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,366
Someone is there!

680
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,033
What is it? Is someone there?

681
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:35,966
(Someone is lying on the floor.)

682
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,500
"Go lie down next to the teacher
and cover yourself with a blanket."

683
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:41,133
(Here is the teacher sleeping.)

684
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,233
(A roll call mission)

685
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:43,066
(Step one: Toss the blanket up.)

686
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,533
(Step two: Cover yourself
with the blanket from head to toe.)

687
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,400
(Who's there?)

688
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
(Warning:
Be careful not to wake the teacher.)

689
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,466
I think, in the end,
she's going to jump out at us.

690
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,233
- Don't make any noise.
- Okay.

691
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,833
(They enter the classroom quietly.)

692
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,433
(Fourth period: Roll call)

693
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,600
(Sneaking in)

694
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:07,266
(They're careful not to wake the teacher.)

695
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,733
(They pick the blanket up quietly.)

696
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,900
(Just toss it up and slide in.)

697
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,000
We're sliding in together?

698
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:16,400
In one...

699
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:17,633
(Fluttering)

700
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,400
(Looking back cautiously)

701
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,133
Three!

702
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,333
(She lies down alone,)

703
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,500
(without the blanket.)

704
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:26,766
(Her ambitious attempt went to waste.)

705
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,566
(Laughing)

706
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,933
(Embarrassed)

707
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,700
(Blushing)

708
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,266
(She does her best to hold back laughter.)

709
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,666
(It's embarrassing but hilarious,
and hilarious to watch.)

710
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,233
(They're trying hard to stay quiet.)

711
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:40,633
(Eye contact)

712
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:42,300
(Now, they cannot stop laughing.)

713
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:44,966
(The fourth period is hard already.)

714
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,066
What's this noise?

715
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:48,633
What are they doing?

716
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,200
They're breathing so heavily right now.

717
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
- For real?
- Yes.

718
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,133
- Are they running?
- I think so.

719
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:54,725
All I can hear is
the rustling of their jackets.

720
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:56,966
What are they doing?

721
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,166
(The blanket slides forward in the air.)

722
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,666
(She learned from her first attempt.)

723
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:06,033
(Stepping back)

724
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,866
(Here comes the problem fixer, JIWOO!)

725
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,000
(She slides forward on her stomach.)

726
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:12,100
(I'm embarrassed for her.)

727
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:14,800
(Almost crying)

728
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,066
(The leader's dignity is tarnished.)

729
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,466
(You could wake the teacher up!)

730
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:24,366
(We've got to tough it out.)

731
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,500
(They settle down after laughing.)

732
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,353
(Making eye contact)

733
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:32,766
(They can't stop laughing now,
especially when they look at each other.)

734
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:35,766
(Think of something sad.)

735
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:38,100
(They managed to calm down again.)

736
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,166
(No, they don't.)

737
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,700
(A-NA slides hard into the blanket.)

738
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,666
(We're doomed.)

739
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:49,066
(Is this even possible?)

740
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,233
(The teacher is up!)

741
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,600
(The scaredy-cats flinch.)

742
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,533
(She's about to crack up
seeing the teacher.)

743
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:56,666
Sleep tight.

744
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,000
(She's a good student,
ensuring the teacher sleeps well.)

745
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,566
(Teacher is back asleep thanks to her.)

746
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:03,100
(Another quick attempt)

747
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,733
(It was a nice try,
but it didn't turn out well.)

748
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:09,466
(With a serious face,)

749
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:11,633
(she delivers a slapstick comedy.)

750
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,466
(Focusing)

751
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,433
(I'm going to bed now!)

752
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,600
(No, I'm not.)

753
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,566
(Will they be able
to finish school today?)

754
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,566
Hurry up and come out.

755
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:25,025
I think it's a really hard mission.

756
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,368
Her breathing is getting heavier.

757
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,467
(Can they all finish the mission in time?)

758
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,700
(Rummaging)

759
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,800
(Strategic change:
Another blanket to try with)

760
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,133
(They're all set with fresh blankets.)

761
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,166
(Be patient.)

762
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,241
(Pfft)

763
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,466
(I can't help but laugh!)

764
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:47,133
(They suddenly bow to the viewers.)

765
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,100
(They're such polite girls.)

766
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,300
(She tries it again after bowing.)

767
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,666
(She takes a catnap instead.)

768
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,733
(Inner peace)

769
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:01,533
I'll do it for real this time.

770
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,866
(For real)

771
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:08,933
(A-NA did it!)

772
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:09,900
(JIWOO is excited.)

773
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,866
(Did you see it?)

774
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,700
(Good night!)

775
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:17,200
(They finished the fourth period.)

776
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,233
Let's go.

777
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,433
It was too easy.

778
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:24,000
It wasn't scary at all.
It was too hilarious.

779
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,566
- You were amazing in the end.
- Right?

780
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:28,766
Let's pretend to be completely scared.

781
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:32,866
Was it scary?

782
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,166
- That was a legendary horror experience.
- It was super scary.

783
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,033
- I don't think you can do it.
- You can't.
