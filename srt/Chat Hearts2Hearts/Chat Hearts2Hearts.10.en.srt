1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,966
(H2H's personality data is saved.)

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,566
(I recommend you to watch
the "Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards.")

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,166
"Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards."

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,233
This is a mic.

5
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,333
- And that is lighting.
- Okay.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,000
- It's so cool.
- Perfect.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,433
We should walk on the red carpet.

8
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:22,823
(The fancy photo wall is ready too.)

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,933
"Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards."

10
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,866
I'm JIWOO, the host of the awards.

11
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:33,366
I invited the stars of the music video
of "The Chase" here!

12
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:37,437
(Their first single album recorded
400,000 copies in first-week sales!)

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,466
(The highest first-week sales
for a girl group debut album!)

14
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:45,200
(The song that ranked top in a music show
in 15 days after the debut)

15
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,633
("The Chase")

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,466
(We invited the stars of the song
to the awards!)

17
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,033
Hi.

18
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,566
(Deep bow toward the camera)

19
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,200
Nice to meet you.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,466
I would've dressed up better
had I known it coming.

21
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:02,300
Only if I'd known it...

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,666
I had no idea.

23
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,033
Everyone else is dressed nicely,

24
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,933
but IAN and I are the worst.

25
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,433
(The comfy sweatsuit duo)

26
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,866
- I thought it'd be a sports day.
- Right.

27
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,500
We had the wrong idea.

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,033
JIWOO, you're dressed perfectly as a host.

29
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,233
I'm a host, who's ready for everything.

30
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,033
- You're indeed our leader.
- Right.

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,366
(Traveling all around Korea,)

32
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,500
(they filmed the music video
for "The Chase.")

33
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:38,533
(The cold and the strong winds
were unavoidable.)

34
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:43,966
(The outfits they put on)

35
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,640
(We reveal
the behind-the-scene footage...)

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,100
(that was as dynamic as their outfits.)

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,266
Although it already feels like ages ago,

38
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,333
it was one
of the most severe cold spells...

39
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,866
- I've experienced in life.
- I agree.

40
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,300
It was really hard,

41
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,566
but it was rewarding...

42
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:01,933
- because the video came out well.
- Right.

43
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,300
I got a tip-off...

44
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,066
that you were totally fine
with the cold in Seoul...

45
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:10,200
after filming the music video.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,800
The cold in Seoul is nothing.

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,200
- It's not.
- I mean it.

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,733
There are so many good backstories
that are too good for just us to know.

49
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:21,900
So, we prepared
"Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards"...

50
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,933
to present awards
who excelled during the music video shoot.

51
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,100
("Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards"
begin now.)

52
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,900
Do you think you'll win an award today?

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,733
Of course.

54
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,333
Does anyone think you'll win first place?

55
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:35,989
(Me!)

56
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,824
(Her eyes tell that she's sure.)

57
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,066
(I won't back off!)

58
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,862
I'm always full of confidence.

59
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,366
- Let's see what happens.
- Okay!

60
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:47,200
Then, the awards now begin in earnest.

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,966
The first award of the day.

62
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,833
CARMEN will announce it for us.

63
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,300
- Thank you.
- What is it?

64
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,442
It's an award presented to a member...

65
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,046
who did best
despite the harsh environment.

66
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,100
Let's meet the candidates now!

67
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,500
(Anticipating)

68
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,366
It's fun.

69
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,200
It's the SanJeonSuJeon Award
for the one who went through a lot.

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,400
Oh, my!

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,833
What's that?

72
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,933
(Windy)

73
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,233
It was not only windy but also cold.

74
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,000
- It was really cold there.
- It rained too.

75
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:24,266
- It even snowed.
- The weather was terrible.

76
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,340
It was our first music video,
and yet we went through so much.

77
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,933
(Their hardship began with winds.)

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,866
(The wind never left them alone
throughout the shoot.)

79
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,881
We couldn't help but scream like that.

80
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,300
(Flapping)

81
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,666
(They'd often become speechless.)

82
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,766
What's the current temperature?

83
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,133
- Maybe 36 degrees Celsius.
- What? 36?

84
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,466
It's so hot!

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,142
(The cold even made them
brainwash themselves.)

86
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,900
It's so warm now.

87
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,166
It's rather hot now.

88
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:53,166
- It's not cold.
- It's not cold!

89
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,533
In 1, 2, 3.

90
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,033
- It's cold!
- It's not cold!

91
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,666
It's freezing!

92
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,166
Is it cold to you when you're from Canada?

93
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,233
I'm from Canada.

94
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,133
Those from Canada can
handle the cold well.

95
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,581
Their lips are frozen.

96
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,166
- It was the first day of the shoot.
- Right.

97
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,400
The day was legendary.

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,466
- Looking at it makes me feel cold.
- Me too.

99
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,456
(However, the wind-caused suffering
didn't stop there.)

100
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,666
(Winds in Jeju)

101
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,800
(The strong wind sounds
different already.)

102
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,500
The cold in Seoul and in Jeju
are different.

103
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,700
In Seoul, we'd say, "It's cold."

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,733
But in Jeju...

105
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,066
(Groaning)

106
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:37,310
We kept running and running
while shooting the music video.

107
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:40,566
- We had to run all the time.
- Since we kept running...

108
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,566
(Running while smiling)

109
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:42,700
(Running in all directions)

110
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,951
We took off running so many times.

111
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,033
We did that so often.

112
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,233
(After so many hardships,)

113
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,001
(who will become the candidates?)

114
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,527
Who will win it?

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,266
I really covet this award.

116
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:00,100
- Number One, YUHA.
- It's me!

117
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,666
(Despite the harsh weather,)

118
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,333
(she through herself for the video.)

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,140
(YUHA is shooting the album jacket.)

120
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,376
It was so cold.

121
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,044
(Perfectly immune to the wind)

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,180
(The kite's long tails are beautiful,
thanks to the wind.)

123
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,966
(Perfect output despite the wind)

124
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,785
(But her struggle against the wind
didn't end there.)

125
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:19,933
It's hailing.

126
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,700
- It hailed for the first time, right?
- Right. I was so startled.

127
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,933
(She never lost her composure
despite the hail.)

128
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:27,900
She's so pretty!

129
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,233
(Endless best cuts like endless hail)

130
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,166
YUHA looks amazing in it.

131
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,166
(YUHA shines bright, thanks to the hail.)

132
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,200
- Give it up for her.
- She did really well.

133
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,138
I was so professional!

134
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,466
Right. You were so professional.

135
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,566
(An action scene is waiting
for Professional YUHA?)

136
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,400
It's the scene
I've been looking forward to!

137
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,614
It's the scene where I trip over a rock.

138
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,518
(The trip-over scene was
at the center of her struggle.)

139
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,887
It begins.

140
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,600
Action!

141
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,491
(She threw herself
and made a rough yet chill jump.)

142
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,633
(It's elegant.)

143
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,533
- You did well.
- You jumped well.

144
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,533
It was awesome.

145
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,000
(But her suffering didn't end so easily.)

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Can you jump a bit higher?

147
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,433
(More realistic expression is requested.)

148
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,233
(I'm really tripping over a rock.)

149
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,433
(Instant cuteness)

150
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:15,066
- So cute!
- Good job!

151
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,410
(She'll do the jump again
because her acting was too good.)

152
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,033
(The jump level goes up and up.)

153
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:20,981
(In a hurry)

154
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,682
(Tripping over a rock)

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,600
(She kept falling and falling.)

156
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,022
You had to keep falling.

157
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,533
(A real struggle with falling)

158
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,833
I really did my best.

159
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:38,298
- Thanks for doing your best.
- Thank you.

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Good job.

161
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,800
It must not be easy to beat YUHA.

162
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,072
- Let's see.
- Right.

163
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,866
The second candidate.

164
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,609
(The second candidate
of the SanJeonSuJeon Award)

165
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,800
Number Two, A-NA.

166
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,681
"The alluring girl?"

167
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,433
(She plopped down on the grass.)

168
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:58,600
(She'd walk...)

169
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,566
(and runs around.)

170
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:03,400
(A-NA's suffering on the grass)

171
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,733
(The horses are gamboling
in the green fields of Jeju.)

172
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,066
(A-NA is filming with horses.)

173
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,966
(The shoot seems to go well.)

174
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,433
(She spotted something.)

175
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,033
Isn't his poop?

176
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,666
It was a real ranch,

177
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,733
Right.

178
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,833
poops were everywhere.

179
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,500
(Walking on the field of muck)

180
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,800
Please walk over here!

181
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,233
(She even lied down on the horses' field.)

182
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,379
Can you lower your body?

183
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,449
- She lied down on the poop field.
- Oh, no!

184
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:30,750
(Following the direction professionally)

185
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,419
She looks beautiful.

186
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,366
(The best cut even on the poop field)

187
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,566
It looks nice.

188
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,300
- She looks terrific.
- Right.

189
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,166
It's nice!

190
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,133
(An individual shoot
on the field of eulalia grass)

191
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,166
I'll try to look like an ethereal girl.

192
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
- Her hair.
- Right!

193
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,006
It was really windy at the time.

194
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,266
Was it in the evening?

195
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,266
No, before the sun rose.

196
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,633
- Oh, before dawn.
- At early hours.

197
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,066
The sunlight is
actually from the lighting.

198
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,133
- Right.
- Right.

199
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,209
(Turn your head powerfully
while flapping your hair.)

200
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,200
It was the hardest part.

201
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,666
It was really windy,
but my hair shouldn't touch my face.

202
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,200
- Oh, my.
- It must've been hard.

203
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,466
I have thick hair.

204
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,464
It's too much for me to handle.

205
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,866
(What's the next scene?)

206
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,533
(Let's go.)

207
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,466
(She's a goddess with her hair untied.)

208
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,600
(Ten seconds to become a goddess)

209
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,666
(Untying)

210
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:30,500
It's interesting.

211
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,133
(Her voluminous hair appears after a cut.)

212
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:36,533
(The goddess ended up
with disheveled hair.)

213
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,133
(It's like she's become a reed.)

214
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,633
(It does look like a reed, though.)

215
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:42,966
Oh, no.

216
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,066
(The shoot continues.)

217
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,066
(The goddess is back...)

218
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:50,300
(with the help of the staff.)

219
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,600
(Pollen blows suddenly toward her.)

220
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,400
(Intensified goddess vibes)

221
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,400
(A legendary scene is created!)

222
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,666
(The secret to it
was also a staff's help.)

223
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,233
He really helped me a lot.

224
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,866
- So many people were there to help us.
- Right.

225
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:13,000
They blew air for us
from the front and back.

226
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:18,600
(She got blown
by the eulalia grass pollen.)

227
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:23,633
The pollen kept hitting my face.

228
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,533
(Some landed on her lips too.)

229
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,933
On her lips!

230
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,266
Some came out very nicely,

231
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,400
while others weren't so satisfying.

232
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,433
A-NA, you still like the cut, don't you?

233
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,433
Yes, I love it.

234
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,600
(Candidates: YUHA and A-NA)

235
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,066
(Who will be the awardee
of the first award?)

236
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,133
It's too hard.

237
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,966
Since YUHA has gone through so much,

238
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,333
I think she'll get the award.

239
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,566
Why do you think so?

240
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,033
Be confident in yourself.

241
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:54,166
It wasn't easy for me either,

242
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,033
but I don't know if I can say that...

243
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,833
You know, the staff were busier than me.

244
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,800
Right.

245
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,733
What do you think, YUHA?

246
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,633
Since I had to jump more than 20 times,

247
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,566
I think I deserve the award.

248
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,410
I agree.

249
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,733
- Shall I open it now?
- Yes.

250
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,315
Let's go.

251
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,886
(Cute)

252
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,033
(Sneak peek)

253
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:24,933
The result is unbelievable.

254
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,033
I'd feel bad if it were me.

255
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:30,541
The first SanJeonSuJeon Award.

256
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:31,533
It goes to...

257
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,700
(A-NA expected it to be YUHA.)

258
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,366
(YUHA is sure that she'll win it.)

259
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,342
(Who will be the first awardee?)

260
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:39,366
YUHA!

261
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:40,833
And...

262
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,000
A-NA!

263
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,333
- Congratulations!
- Me?

264
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,533
What?

265
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,666
Congratulations! You both won the award.

266
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,933
Really?

267
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,920
(The destiny to win the award together)

268
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,566
Let's go and walk on the red carpet.

269
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:57,724
It's like a wedding.

270
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,500
We'll live happily.

271
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,300
Thank you.

272
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,133
(You came too!)

273
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:05,833
- Hi. Live happily!
- I wish you happiness!

274
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,066
- Thank you.
- Stand here.

275
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,833
We'll hear from A-NA first.

276
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:15,133
I'm so happy that we both won the award.

277
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,366
Although we've gone through a lot,

278
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:20,033
- it was...
- Sorry!

279
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,417
Let me give you the trophy first.

280
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:28,500
I thought you canceled my trophy.

281
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,133
(The glorious trophies)

282
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
- Congrats!
- I'm happy for you.

283
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,300
(It feels like they won the award again.)

284
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,566
It wasn't easy for me, of course,

285
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,866
but the staff members went
through so much more.

286
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:44,166
Thank you.

287
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,266
You're so cute.

288
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:48,466
All the hard work was worth it...

289
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:51,066
because the music video turned out
so well.

290
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,166
I'd like to thank the staff too.

291
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,533
- We'll live happily!
- Hi.

292
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,300
- They got married.
- Don't ever break up.

293
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,287
The two have gone through a lot.

294
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,133
They're beautiful.

295
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,266
(Photo time)

296
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,433
(SanJeonSuJeon Award)

297
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,400
For the next award, can you help me, A-Na?

298
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,335
(A-NA)

299
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,866

"Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards."

301
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,600
Let's meet the candidates first.

302
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,545
(She's a great host.)

303
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,133
It's a proper award ceremony.

304
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,883
The OnJeNa UtSang Award.

305
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:32,766
The OnJeNa UtSang Award.

306
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,466
Number One. CARMEN.

307
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:39,766
(I'm the candidate!)

308
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,266
I'm happy 24 hours a day.

309
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,900
Hi. I'm CARMEN.

310
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,700
(Even in the harsh wind in Jeju)

311
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,400
(Overcame!)

312
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,566
She's so cute!

313
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,200
(It's me, but it looks strange.)

314
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,100
We can do it!

315
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,566
It's not cold.

316
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
- She's so cute!
- Let's go!

317
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,766
What's up, guys?

318
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,451
(She says what she has to say
regardless of the wind's interruption.)

319
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,166
(She's saying her hair keeps blowing
in her face because of the wind.)

320
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,189
You still look pretty.

321
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,633
Is she really 20?

322
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:13,860
She's so cute.

323
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:17,900
(As long as CARMEN is around,
we're all happy.)

324
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,300
(Fun dancing time)

325
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,900
(Stay with CARMEN
if you want to be happy.)

326
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,400
It's the fourth day
of the music video filming.

327
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:30,866
I'll do my best...

328
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:32,100
with the music video...

329
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,600
and try hard...

330
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,733
- for the best result.
- So cute.

331
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,900
- She's like a baby.
- She is.

332
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Let's do this! I have to go now!

333
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,233
It was really cold that day.

334
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,666
It was freezing.

335
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,333
(Despite the cold,
she finished the shoot with a smile.)

336
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,566
She's honest.

337
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:57,800
(The OnJeNa UtSang Award candidate:
CARMEN)

338
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,166
(She's even shier after the clip.)

339
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,733
She deserves to be nominated.

340
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:03,533
Right.

341
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,533
Let's meet the second candidate.

342
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,700
Number Two, IAN.

343
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,233
(She does deserve to be nominated.)

344
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,633
(Lift the spirits first!)

345
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,333
It's already noisy.

346
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,966
- Are you okay? You must've been scared.
- You must've been scared.

347
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,600
Let's get on the elevator.

348
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,796
Don't cry.

349
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,900
What was that?

350
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,633
(Copying YUHA's jumping scene)

351
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:31,433
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

352
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,139
We did that too?

353
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,700
We're filming the group scene
on the escalator now.

354
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,733
Right.

355
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,766
This pose looks a bit awkward.

356
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,100
It was pretty difficult to pose
on the escalator.

357
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,200
IAN was like AI that day.

358
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:48,500
(Although it was hard,
IAN pulled it off perfectly.)

359
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,233
- Bye!
- Bye.

360
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:54,900
(Dopamine rush)

361
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,166
What were you doing?

362
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,933
IAN can't stay still even for a moment.

363
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,333
(IAN's dopamine rush never stops.)

364
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,600
IAN!

365
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,766
(Who will win the award? CARMEN vs. IAN)

366
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:12,366
- It's so fierce.
- It's neck-and-neck.

367
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,533
- Let's see.
- Who will win it?

368
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:19,066
I think IAN will win it
because she's funny.

369
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:23,700
I also think CARMEN has a chance
because she smiles all the time.

370
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,800
After watching the clip,
I fell in love with CARMEN.

371
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,766
Me too.

372
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:29,433
She's so adorable.

373
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:31,933
She's got the unique pure charm.

374
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,400
- Right.
- She's happy all the time.

375
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
She was cute when she hurried away...

376
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,366
in the middle of talking.

377
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:40,300
(IAN's favorite moment)

378
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,533
(Time to present the awardee)

379
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh, no!

380
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,633
Why?

381
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,400
"Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards."

382
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,966
What?
What's wrong with your pronunciation?

383
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,533
Please pronounce it clearly.

384
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,700
The OnJeNa UtSang Award goes to...

385
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,566
(Drum sound)

386
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,233
(The candidates are holding hands tight.)

387
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,604
It's CARMEN next to IAN!

388
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,133
Congratulations!

389
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,033
Congrats!

390
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,433
(Elegant way of expressing thanks)

391
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,033
Congrats!

392
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,733
How do you feel?

393
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:17,133
Thank you for giving me this award.

394
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,011
I didn't know I'd win this!

395
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,033
(Overwhelmed)

396
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,166
Mom, Dad!

397
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,200
I've made it!

398
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,800
(What an acting!)

399
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,033
I promise I will continue to give you
happy and bright energy.

400
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,433
Please support me!

401
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,733
Thank you!

402
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:38,700
YUHA, what's the next award?

403
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,566
Let's meet the candidates first!

404
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:43,133
(Right away?)

405
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,333
The O-Goo O-Goo Award.

406
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,133
(What on earth is that?)

407
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,333
"O-Goo O-Goo?"

408
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,066
It's the award for a member...

409
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,833
- I can already tell who it'll be.
- who is reliable.

410
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,100
- YE-ON.
- She'll definitely win it.

411
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,466
YE-ON. I knew she'd win it!

412
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,633
- She's so cute.
- So adorable.

413
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:10,666
(A harmless baby dumpling)

414
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,733
She's like a baby.

415
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,400
She is a baby, anyway.

416
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,466
- YE-ON was so cute that day.
- Right.

417
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,038
So cute.

418
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:22,633
(The cute baby is loved by everyone.)

419
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,533
YE-ON is so cute.

420
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,533
(YE-ON is polite all the time.)

421
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,500
Right.

422
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,933
- It's okay.
- It's okay?

423
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
I think Na Yeon is...

424
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,533
- I'm YE-ON.
- YE-ON.

425
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,033
(Satisfied)

426
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:39,900
- I talked to YE-ON...
- She's so cute.

427
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,833
(CARMEN is excited
about her first visit to Jeju.)

428
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:46,333
Finally, I'm in Jeju.

429
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,333
The moment I arrived here,

430
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:52,100
I realized that the air here
was different from Korea.

431
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,000
Right?

432
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,100
Jeju is also a part of Korea.
You should've said, "Seoul" instead.

433
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,433
That's right!

434
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:02,333
- That's the YE-ON I know.
- She's smart.

435
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,633
(The robot won't let it slide.)

436
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:05,893
She's a stickler for details.

437
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:07,416
(On standby)

438
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,700
(She spotted the camera.)

439
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,549
(Hi there.)

440
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,425
(The older members greet the camera.)

441
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,800
(Standing upright)

442
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:15,760
She's so cute.

443
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,314
- She's focused.
- How cute.

444
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,600
(Flaring)

445
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,700
(Even when her hair blocks her view)

446
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,628
- Oh, no.
- She's struggling.

447
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,933
(She doesn't give up.)

448
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,133
Oh, my goodness.

449
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,666
I didn't know she was like that.

450
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,044
That's hilarious.

451
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,480
She was dancing so hard.

452
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,366
- Gosh...
- YE-ON.

453
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,500
How did you manage to dance
in that situation?

454
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,866
So, I changed my hairstyle after that.

455
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:43,800
- Yes, I remember that.
- Did you tie your hair?

456
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,365
- Right.
- She had twin tails.

457
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,733
(The talented youngest
can pull off everything.)

458
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,200
(YE-ON is a promising youngest.)

459
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,630
Please look forward to it.

460
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,166
(The O-Goo O-Goo Award,
Congratulations, YE-ON!)

461
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,333
(She stands up even before she's called.)

462
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,433
I'll announce the winner.

463
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,000
(The robot is ready to march.)

464
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,433
She's already ready.

465
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:07,566
(All set and ready to go)

466
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,200
"The first Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards."

467
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,951
The The O-Goo O-Goo Award goes to...

468
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,566
YE-ON! Congratulations.

469
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:15,700
(Initiating gratitude mode)

470
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,433
- Please complete my heart!
- Over here!

471
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,133
(Constant heart requests)

472
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,666
- I love you!
- YE-ON!

473
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,200
- Complete my heart!
- YE-ON!

474
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,366
- I love you!
- Over here, YE-ON!

475
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:25,866
YE-ON!

476
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,033
So adorable!

477
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,300
- Congratulations, YE-ON.
- Thank you.

478
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:36,766
Everyone helped me
feel comfortable at the shooting,

479
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,517
and I think
that's how I was able to win this.

480
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,466
- That's like an actual speech.
- Thank you so much.

481
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:41,866
(It's all thanks to you.)

482
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:44,402
Then, why don't we praise her
to celebrate...

483
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:47,266
- her winning the award?
- Yes.

484
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:49,666
Okay. YE-ON,

485
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,900
- you did so well.
- Our cutie, you did great.

486
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,956
(We're proud of you.)

487
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,133
(The robot accepted the praise.)

488
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:58,266
Thank you.

489
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,252
And she doesn't forget to pose.

490
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,866
- She's so cute.
- She's good at this.

491
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,733
- Well done.
- She's just adorable.

492
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,185
We're very proud of her.

493
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:10,159
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

494
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,933
YE-ON, can you tell us the next award?

495
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:16,500
The next award category is one
that I also really desire.

496
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
This award is given to someone...

497
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,721
who showed splendid leadership
and led the dance performance...

498
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:23,959
during the shoot
of a music video for "The Chase."

499
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,624
Let's see the nominees together.

500
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,766
Who'd be the nominees?

501
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,466
YeoungCha YeoungCha Award.

502
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,366
"YeoungCha YeoungCha Award."

503
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:35,033
Number One, JUUN.

504
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,166
- So cute.
- The cutie of our group.

505
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,700
(And the charisma within her)

506
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,633
(She's a perfectionist in dance moves.)

507
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,111
- She's so cool.
- How charismatic.

508
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:49,773
When someone struggles with the dance,
I run to help her.

509
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,166
Our perfectly synchronized
performance is possible,

510
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,166
- all thanks to JUUN.
- That's right.

511
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
They're taking a tight shot
on our group dance first.

512
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,400
- Got it.
- Okay.

513
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,766
(Tap)

514
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:02,433
(She organizes their positions.)

515
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,363
She's awesome.

516
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,566
JUUN, you're amazing.

517
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,166
- We really have...
- Are you warm enough?

518
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,933
- to dance hard.
- Okay.

519
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,300
(Careful and meticulous)

520
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:14,807
She's also so sweet.

521
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,259
I looked out for many people.

522
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,578
I'm proud.

523
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,558
Okay, here we go.

524
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,600
(The soft tofu is on standby.)

525
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,372
(Instantly becoming the hard tofu)

526
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,370
That's amazing.

527
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:31,069
- Look at that.
- She's so cool.

528
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,433
That was crazy.

529
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:36,061
That doesn't feel like me.

530
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,333
(The shooting continues.)

531
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,666
(Like this?)

532
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,534
(Teamwork is essential
for her pair dance with JIWOO.)

533
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:44,433
(Practicing again and again)

534
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,000
(The first take goes smoothly.)

535
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,875
(Stopping)

536
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,100
I remember that.

537
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,064
(A shoe on the floor)

538
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
- Oh, that one.
- Hold on.

539
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,900
I remember that one.

540
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,508
I'm sorry, JUUN.

541
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:04,362
- It's all right.
- I stepped on her shoe.

542
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,600
(JIWOO and JUUN powerfully moved forward.)

543
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,033
(It came off.)

544
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,433
(It was taken off as JIWOO stepped on it.)

545
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,200
(JUUN-rella)

546
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,557
"JUUN-rella."

547
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,366
I'm so sorry!

548
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:19,711
Don't be embarrassed! It's fine.

549
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,106
What just happened?

550
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,733
It's all right.

551
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,174
(Putting on her charismatic face again)

552
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,333
- She looks so cool.
- That's terrific.

553
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,197
(They got it on their second attempt.)

554
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,533
(With her soft charisma,)

555
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:34,333
(she performed with a cheerful spirit.)

556
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:37,156
(The first nominee, JUUN)

557
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,658
- You looked so cool, JUUN.
- I agree.

558
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,033
(I looked amazing?)

559
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,261
It's so impressive.

560
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,866
(Here's the second nominee.)

561
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,000
- The second nominee.
- I think I know who it is.

562
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,506
I have someone in mind too.

563
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,649
Number Two, JIWOO.

564
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:50,600
- Yes, JIWOO.
- It's JIWOO, of course.

565
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,075
I saw that coming.

566
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:55,000
They're both strong contenders.

567
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,533
(Like a youth movie,)

568
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:58,857
(it was very romantic.)

569
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,600
We can do this! It's not cold!

570
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,892
- We're young!
- Let's have fun.

571
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,732
- Why are you so obsessed with that word?
- You like the youth so much.

572
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,600
You were really into that word.

573
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
That was just before
she became legally an adult,

574
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,714
so she was obsessed with the word.

575
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,479
Youthfulness is
what she pursues in her style.

576
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:19,364
Innocence, youthfulness, and romance
are the aesthetics I go for.

577
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,733
(JIWOO's youth is hotter than anyone.)

578
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,458
We should keep our balance and turn.

579
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,166
(This is my romantic spirit.)

580
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,500
(Group performance shoot)

581
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,633
After you turn,
take a pause and look ahead...

582
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:38,052
- before walking out.
- Okay.

583
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,126
We should put the legs together.

584
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,976
- She's charismatic.
- You're not doing it properly.

585
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,200
When you put your leg down after a kick.

586
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:45,766
- That's impressive.
- We have to put our legs back.

587
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,000
You shouldn't just stop after this move.

588
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,566
(Pause and walk)

589
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,533
(JIWOO's checklist: Pause and walk)

590
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,600
(JIWOO's checklist: Gathering back)

591
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,366
She definitely has leadership.

592
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:57,503
She's a leader material.

593
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,004
Well, I am the leader of this group.

594
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,065
Oh, you're right.

595
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:04,966
She is.

596
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,622
She's a leader full of leadership.

597
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:10,800
(Shooting JIWOO's part)

598
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,066
You can come out after the "puzzle."

599
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:14,933
(Thinking)

600
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:17,033
Do I lip-sync the rest of the part?

601
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,333
Yes, just your part.

602
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:19,933
What about the part we all sing?

603
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,033
All of you will lip-sync.

604
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:22,839
She's meticulous.

605
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,792
JIWOO is really detail-oriented.

606
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,700
- No wonder her MBTI is ISTJ.
- I know.

607
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,855
She's very detail-oriented.

608
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,466
Action.

609
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,500
(Everyone is lip-syncing.)

610
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,466
Come out.

611
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:40,896
That was cute.

612
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,800
Shall we close it now?

613
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,933
Push the close button.

614
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,285
You can come out as it opens.

615
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:47,519
Here we go.

616
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,466
Lip-sync!

617
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,033
- Cut.
- They can't hear the music.

618
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,242
(Another blooper due to the audio issue)

619
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:57,900
We'll turn the volume up.

620
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,400
(Will she succeed this time?)

621
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,433
(It's open.)

622
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,066
(Fabulously done)

623
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:08,266
(That's so cool.)

624
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,866
When we did that scene, people told me...

625
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:12,900
that we were looking very intimidating...

626
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,108
and they would've run off...

627
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:16,976
if they had bumped into us
in the elevator.

628
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,965
(The second nominee)

629
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,300
(She always grounds the team.)

630
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,342
- Blow up the world with "The Chase!"
- Blow up the world with "The Chase!"

631
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,988
(She checks on every detail with care...)

632
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,500
(and leads the team cheerfully.)

633
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,703
We can do this.

634
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,026
Let's go.

635
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,885
(The youth and romance of the leader)

636
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,500
(Who is the winner of this award?)

637
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,366
We were able to pull off
a perfect group dance...

638
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,833
- because we had JUUN and JIWOO.
- That's so true.

639
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,366
- They both should win this one.
- Yes, give them both.

640
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:41,333
"The first Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards."

641
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,633
The Cheerful Spirit Award goes to...

642
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,700
- Drum roll!
- The winner is...

643
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,533
Who would it be?

644
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:47,533
(JUUN or JIWOO?)

645
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:50,000
(Tell us already!)

646
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:51,666
JIWOO...

647
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,933
and JUUN.

648
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:56,066
They both won the award. Congratulations.

649
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,266
(The baby MC knows
how to make them sweat.)

650
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,266
Wonderful!

651
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,466
(Cheerful Spirit Award winners)

652
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,069
I noticed I was more careful...

653
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,842
with the details in the video
than I thought.

654
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,766
It must've been hard for the members.

655
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,400
Not at all.

656
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,568
Thanks to your meticulousness,

657
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:11,276
we're called
a perfectly-synced idol group.

658
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,433
She's right.

659
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,366
- Thank you.
- You guys are the best.

660
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:18,633
I'm grateful for following my lead
and the award too.

661
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:22,100
You're amazing!

662
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,066
First of all, thank you so much
for this amazing award.

663
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,466
(This is my thanking performance.)

664
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:30,402
Just count on me with your performances!

665
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:32,866
- Congratulations.
- Good for her.

666
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:34,533
Can you show us a dance move?

667
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:35,533
Popping?

668
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:36,366
Okay, then...

669
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,266
- You're ready at any time.
- I'll go up to the photo wall...

670
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:39,618
with a moonwalk.

671
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,000
(The performance captain is the best.)

672
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
That'd be so cool.

673
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,133
Let's go.

674
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,400
- In 5, 6, 7, 8!
- In 5, 6, 7, 8!

675
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,266
(Going smoothly on a rigid red carpet)

676
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,266
(Cheerfully dancing)

677
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,300
(Smooth walking)

678
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:54,133
(It's like she's on a moving walkway.)

679
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:56,900
(The soft tofu's amazing performance)

680
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,600
(Way to go!)

681
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:01,100
She's good, as expected.

682
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:04,200
(While the moonwalk heated up the air,)

683
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,966
(the next marching member is nervous.)

684
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:07,933
But I...

685
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:10,500
I know you'd feel pressured,

686
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,466
but show us the confidence you have
as a leader.

687
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,400
Do that dance move
where we pause and walk.

688
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,791
- The pause and walk?
- Yes.

689
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,833
(You've got to pause first and walk.)

690
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,433
Pause and go.

691
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,366
(This is how you do the pause and walk.)

692
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,066
(Our leader is fabulous!)

693
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,300
(Cheerful performance and leadership)

694
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,348
Congratulations.

695
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,600
Thank you.

696
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,466
Once again, congratulations.

697
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:35,300
This award is given to a member...

698
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,421
who has constantly tried
to start a conversation with others...

699
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:38,557
and amused them...

700
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,360
so they wouldn't get so tired
during the shoot.

701
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,133
Okay.

702
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,300
I wonder who will take home the honor.

703
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's check it out on screen.

704
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
Let's check it out.

705
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:55,055
Best JOZAL JOZAL Award.

706
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,966
(What a name for an award!)

707
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,700
- It sounds so funny.
- That's quite a name.

708
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:03,700
Number One, STELLA.

709
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,428
(She shares all the latest updates
with her bubbly interviews.)

710
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,066
What do you feel about your solo shot?

711
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:10,000
Please tell us how you feel.

712
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,333
(Let's take a look
at the chattery interviewer, STELLA.)

713
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:16,789
Hi.

714
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:19,366
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

715
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:21,766
Hello.

716
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,266
(Gorgeous greeting)

717
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,233
- Can I try them on?
- Sure.

718
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:27,100
Let me try that.

719
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
I'll act like...

720
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,309
Then, make up your hot girl's name.

721
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:34,044
Everyone, welcome back
to Hot Girl News today.

722
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,933
We have IAN Jeong.

723
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:38,066
- Hello, IAN Jeong.
- Hello.

724
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,066
It's such an honor to meet you here today.

725
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,810
Can you tell us why you are here today?

726
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:44,375
Because...

727
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,524
Shooting.

728
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:47,609
Shooting?

729
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:49,133
What does that mean?

730
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:50,343
A video...

731
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,074
They get along so well.

732
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,799
Yes, they click.

733
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,100
They're like that when we practice.

734
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,400
- Right.
- From time to time,

735
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,066
it's interesting to see them.

736
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:03,442
They're the kind of people
I've never encountered before.

737
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:06,780
- That's how we spend our spare time.
- That's right.

738
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,622
(Day 5 of music video filming)

739
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,566
(No matter where she is,
the interview never stops.)

740
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
(Chatting away in English)

741
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,166
I talked for too long.

742
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,200
(Passing the mic)

743
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,400
(CARMEN makes a neat remark.)

744
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:25,933
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

745
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,300
- I love you.
- Bye.

746
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,166
(A surprise interruption
with familiar accents)

747
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,582
"Familiar accents."

748
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:33,157
I'm fine, thank you. And you?

749
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:36,174
- Four of us will talk in English.
- Okay.

750
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,591
("STELLA NEWS" never ends.)

751
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:40,345
And we have YUHA.

752
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,500
And they're going
to speak in English for us.

753
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,271
Please talk about how you felt
about today's filming.

754
00:29:45,336 --> 00:29:46,873
- Okay.
- I love you.

755
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,900
- Thank you so much. I love you.
- Thank you.

756
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,466
Nice to meet you.

757
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:53,200
She's such a fluent speaker.

758
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,384
I know. I'm so good.

759
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,400
I'll try.

760
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,376
(Data input)

761
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
Today was so much fun.

762
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,466
Okay.

763
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,700
Please look forward to our music video.

764
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,166
And today was so much fun!

765
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,333
I hope you guys really enjoy our filming.

766
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:07,010
And we had lots of fun today...

767
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:08,257
- So cute.
- and went to various places.

768
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:09,602
So please look forward to it. We love you!

769
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,300
(The interview goes on anyhow.)

770
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:15,066
(Because STELLA is the anchor.)

771
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,833
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

772
00:30:17,153 --> 00:30:18,442
(The interview begins again.)

773
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:19,566
You look great on camera.

774
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,200
YUHA.

775
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,487
How is the weather today?

776
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:24,523
It's cold.

777
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,666
(Giggling)

778
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,300
We'll see you guys next time.
Thank you for watching.

779
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,700
- Bye!
- See you!

780
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,963
(See you again, "STELLA NEWS")

781
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:35,900
- She likes interviewing people.
- Yes.

782
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,033
How many interviews did you do?

783
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,404
And she's pretty good at it.

784
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,766
- Yes, she has a knack for it.
- She's great.

785
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:45,658
Have you dreamt of being
a reporter or something?

786
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:49,855
I wanted to be a news broadcaster.

787
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:51,948
- No wonder.
- The news anchor.

788
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,566
(Here's the second nominee.)

789
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,166
Number Two, IAN.

790
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,866
(She loves to play with the camera.)

791
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,833
(She starts talking
every time she runs into it.)

792
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,400
Look how energetic she is.

793
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
(Let's see how IAN chatted.)

794
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,400
I've never seen IAN quiet
for more than a minute.

795
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,700
- That's just impossible for her.
- It's not possible.

796
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,366
We even did a challenge together.

797
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:17,066
We tried not talking
for more than a minute.

798
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,744
And you guys failed.

799
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,532
Except for when I eat and sleep,
I can't stay quiet.

800
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,009
(The filming site in Jeju)

801
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:27,515
(Boisterous)

802
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,100
We feel a lot more comfortable
with the reality show.

803
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,166
- Me too.
- I agree.

804
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,975
- Let's come up with a name.
- Good idea.

805
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:36,293
- Maybe "Really?"
- "Really?"

806
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:38,533
- Yes, "Really."
- "Really."

807
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:41,466
Our realistic moments will come
through on camera.

808
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,933
- "Really."
- "Really."

809
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,833
- That's a pretty good name.
- Right?

810
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,966
- Hey, "Really."
- Hi, "Really."

811
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:51,566
- Hey, Dust.
- Hi to you too, Dust.

812
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:53,833
- Hi, Dust.
- Hey.

813
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:56,033
(Dust is enthusiastic.)

814
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,766
- Hi, Dust.
- Nice to meet you.

815
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:02,733
I shall call you Lanky.

816
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:03,633
Lanky?

817
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,200
She's great with making up names.

818
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,433
(The naming session ends successfully.)

819
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,466
She's good.

820
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:10,400
Let's call it Ponge.

821
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,766
- Ponge.
- Sponge. Ponge, hey.

822
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,566
- Hi, Ponge.
- Oh, the sponge.

823
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,897
(Dust's friend, Ponge)

824
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,308
Can it get this?

825
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,633
(Thanks to the chatterbox,)

826
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,333
(Dust and Ponge are working hard.)

827
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,697
ASMR.

828
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,747
- I see you enjoy doing ASMR.
- Right.

829
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,748
I had a YouTube channel before.

830
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,600
Thank you.

831
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,533
This time...

832
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,266
She's never quiet.

833
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:37,513
(IAN keeps on chattering.)

834
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:38,933
(Talking about horse poop,
grateful moments,)

835
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:40,133
(the wind, the outfit for the video)

836
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,140
She's the real chatterbox.

837
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:43,662
How is she talking so much?

838
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,466
Are you a tour guide or something?

839
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:47,699
- She must be.
- She keeps talking.

840
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,333
So cute.

841
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,300
("Really" had many fun moments,
thanks to IAN's chatter.)

842
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,533
(Who will win the Best JOZAL JOZAL Award?)

843
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,000
(Neck and neck until the end)

844
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,866
This one is hard to choose.
It's truly neck and neck.

845
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:03,392
- Oh, no.
- Right.

846
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,766
They both deserve it.

847
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,833
Best JOZAL JOZAL Award goes to...

848
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,500

849
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,200
(Smirk)

850
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,733
STELLA and IAN!

851
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:15,000
Congratulations.

852
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,266
- My honey!
- My honey!

853
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:19,133
(The sound of energy draining)

854
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,333
(Her energy is hard to handle.)

855
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,334
Help me.

856
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:25,479
- Come here.
- Congratulations.

857
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:29,033
Hello.
This is the news broadcaster, STELLA.

858
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,600
Today, IAN and I...

859
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,266
won the Best JOZAL JOZAL Award.

860
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,233
(Is this the charm of a Canadian?)

861
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:39,000
Shall we hear how IAN feels about it?

862
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,966
Yes, I'm more than happy to receive...

863
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:44,800
the Best JOZAL JOZAL Award,
along with my beloved one.

864
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,433
I'll try harder to chatter
as much as I can.

865
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:49,566
Thank you.

866
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:51,200
(Breaking news:
IAN says, "I'll chatter more.")

867
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,766
I'd like to say a few words as well.

868
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,978
As a chatterbox, I'll keep on...

869
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:59,066
chatting away with IAN,
so there's never a quiet moment!

870
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,800
We'll chat even more!

871
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,466
- Can you hear my heartbeat?
- Can you hear my heartbeat?

Thank you.

874
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:07,133
Good work.

"The first Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards."

876
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,233
All the awards have been presented.

877
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:14,133
(Mom, I won the award.)

878
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,633
What did you think about today?

879
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,400
- It was so much fun.
- I had a blast.

880
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,900
- I had a fun trip down memory lane today.
- Right.

881
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,200
Yes, I hope you enjoyed every moment...

882
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,900
You look exhausted, though.

883
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,808
- Yes, are you all right?
- Are you okay?

884
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,466
- She looks tired.
- Do I look exhausted?

885
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:32,700
Would you like a seat?

886
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,100
Are you tired?

887
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,000
You look so drained.

888
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,981
I'm okay.

889
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:39,342
I'm fine.

890
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:40,900
I'm not tired at all.

891
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,100
Tell us how it was to be the MC.

892
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,033
Actually,
I've always wanted to host a show,

893
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,059
so I had so much fun today.

894
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:51,666
How did you like me as an MC?

895
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,366
- You were amazing.
- It was impeccable.

896
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:54,766
I saw the potential.

897
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,533
Should we praise her skills?

898
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:58,600
That's not necessary.

899
00:34:59,033 --> 00:34:59,900
Really...

900
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,366
I'd like that!

901
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,366
Here we go.

902
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,400
- You did so well!
- We're proud of you.

903
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,500
Really...

904
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,600
No!

905
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:10,600
(Freaking out)

906
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,500
(It's such a rare chance!)

907
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,466
JIWOO, you're amazing.

908
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:18,466
(You're the leader born to be praised.)

909
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,733
Yes, congratulations
to all the award winners.

910
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:22,992
(Trying to ignore as much as she can)

911
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:24,860
We'll do our best...

912
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:27,866
to become artists
worthy of the awards we received today.

913
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,633
- Please look forward to it!
- Please look forward to it!

914
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:32,966
- Bye!
- Bye!

915
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,200
Thank you.

916
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,933
- Bye now!
- See you!

917
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,433
(Next episode)

918
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:42,400
(Hearts2Hearts goes to school!)

919
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,166
(The new semester begins for H2H.)

920
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,418
(Today's task: Assigning departments)

921
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:50,633
(I'm perfect for that department.)

922
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:51,833
It's me.

923
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,933
(A heated election rally
for a seat on the team)

924
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,266
(If I can be one of them,)

925
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:58,700
(I can even do an impression!)

926
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,333
(And the result of the vote is...)

927
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:01,593
(Surprise present arrived)

928
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,759
(They received an unexpected gift.)

929
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,033
(If you want to find out...)

930
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,600
(why it ended up in a flood of tears,)

931
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,300
(stay tuned for the next episode!)
