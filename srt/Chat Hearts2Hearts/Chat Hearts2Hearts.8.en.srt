1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,735
- You can go in first.
- See you!

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,403
(The goal is to reduce the time
as much as possible.)

3
00:00:03,428 --> 00:00:05,906
- You can do it!
- Go for it!

4
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:07,941
- See you soon!
- Let's go.

5
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:09,046
Good luck!

6
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:11,245
The Chestnuts, you can do it!

7
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,095
Let's go.

8
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:16,207
- I'm not scared.
- We're not scared.

9
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,353
But it's too dark.

10
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,221
- It's darker than I thought.
- Hold on.

11
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,689
I can't see anything.

12
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:25,559
I guess they went in.

13
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:29,406
Tell me roughly if it's scary or not.

14
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:30,964
It's scary, yes.

15
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,532
It's not scary but actually is scary.

16
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,112
- What are you saying?
- It's scary but not scary.

17
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:35,936
You know what I mean.

18
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,237
Actually,

19
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,910
the cameramen were scarier in it.

20
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:42,166
They ran toward us with the cameras.

21
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:45,649
(The main reason for the screams
by the Tallies)

22
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,982
(Hi!)

23
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,218
(Startled by the cameraman,
they were on the meerkat mode nonstop.)

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,955
They ran toward us really quickly,
and it scared us.

25
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,423
The cameramen were quite scary.

26
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,460
(Will the Chestnuts be
able to overcome it?)

27
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,896
(Striding)

28
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,365
(Spotting the scream maker)

29
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,800
(Oh, it's the cameraman.)

30
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,602
Oh, we should go here first.

31
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,738
(The brave Chestnuts aren't
scared at all.)

32
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:11,738
Here.

33
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:13,440
(They only care about attending classes.)

34
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,910
(Checking attendance in the PE class)

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,011
Is that actually possible?

36
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,171
(Just do it. We have no time.)

37
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,459
(Quick try, quick miss)

38
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,601
- Wait.
- Hold up.

39
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,087
(Their competition spirit kicked in.)

40
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:29,156
(1 fallen)

41
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,308
(The troubleshooter is here.)

42
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,158
Gosh.

43
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:33,226
(Burning passion)

44
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:35,973
(Let's finish it quickly and move on.)

45
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:37,214
(JUUN gives it a shot.)

46
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,929
(2 fallen)

47
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:40,500
I got the hang of it.

48
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:45,939
- Right on.
- How many did we knock down?

49
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,253
(First period: PE class,
Knock over five paper cups first!)

50
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,460
We have one left.

51
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,296
(They have one more to go.)

52
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:55,386
(Just one more!)

53
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,017
- We did it.
- We made it.

54
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,570
(JUUN's clean finish)

55
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:02,956
We made it, right?

56
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,992
- We finished the first class!
- It's a success!

57
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:06,132
Bye.

58
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,562
They succeeded in the first class.

59
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:10,530
Maybe we were just bad.

60
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,396
They made it really quickly.

61
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:14,201
Maybe it's because we went first.

62
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:16,580
- We just had no idea about it.
- Right.

63
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:18,972
Still, we must've looked funny.

64
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:23,010
- Should we go here next?
- The second period.

65
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,424
(The Chestnuts are bravely going
to the second floor.)

66
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,334
(They easily pass
by the nightmarish mirror too.)

67
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,388
- JUUN, wait for me.
- Okay.

68
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:37,457
(Looking around)

69
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,892
I'm a bit scared.

70
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,463
The lights here are eerie.

71
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:44,930
(The second floor is creepy.)

72
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:45,805
Hold on.

73
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,433
(Walking close to the wall
while holding hands tight)

74
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,271
Wait.

75
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,406
(Anxious)

76
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:54,585
(Her hunch was right.)

77
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,528
(They're surprised
by the Chestnuts' first scream.)

78
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:58,378
What happened?

79
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,313
What is going on?

80
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,717
(An exciting greet by the goblin)

81
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:05,909
(I almost got a heart attack.)

82
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,506
- Is it here?
- Go in.

83
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,889
Let's go in.

84
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,267
(The second period: Korean)

85
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,894
It's the second period.

86
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,500
- Do we have to do this?
- It looks hard.

87
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,919
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

88
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:21,001
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?

89
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:25,605
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

90
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:28,809
It's different from ours.

91
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,911
I guess they give different texts.

92
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:35,159
(It was the "woodchuck" one
and the "Betty botter" one, for sure.)

93
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:37,818
Let's keep practicing...

94
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,843
(15 minutes ago)

95
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:42,355
(They practiced
the tongue twister nonstop.)

96
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:44,124
It's all different.

97
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,792
(It all went in vain.)

98
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,153
What do we do?

99
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:49,996
(What will they do?)

100
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,198
- Let's do it.
- Sure.

101
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,133
We'll practice first, right?

102
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:55,035
- No, let's do it right away.
- Right now?

103
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:56,837
- We'll try.
- We'll try.

104
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:01,244
- Peter Piper picked a peck of...
- It's a fail.

105
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,340
(What?)

106
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,717
Look. There are instructions.

107
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,581
- Oh, my.
- What's that?

108
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:11,199
(It's what...)

109
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:12,486
(they heard a while ago.)

110
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:13,887
What is the kitty-ear heart?

111
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:17,514
(They practiced it without clear clues.)

112
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:21,491
(We had no idea.)

113
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,210
- Can you do it? Should we go now?
- Let's do it.

114
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:26,165
We'll try.

115
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,335
(The Chestnuts' second try)

116
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,638
Peter Piper picked...

117
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,442
a peck of pickled peppers.

118
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,912
Patrick Piper picked...

119
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,948
a peck of pickled pepperoni.

120
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,892
(Kitty JUUN nailed it!)

121
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,218
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

122
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:53,226
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

123
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:55,729
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?

124
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:59,102
(Only one more sentence to go
to clear the mission!)

125
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,835
Fuzzy Wuzzy was fuzzy, wasn't he?

126
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:05,138
(They finished the second period
just in two tries.)

127
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:07,874
Good. Let's move on.

128
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,411
- They're moving on.
- They're very fast.

129
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:14,390
- What did you do in the third period?
- The third period?

130
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,616
Oh, the third one was fun!

131
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,634
You'll see it later.

132
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,586
There's a guy.

133
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,523
I'm your teacher!

134
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,418
(Who is this guy?)

135
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:29,786
(Holding back her laughter)

136
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:32,199
- Hello.
- Hi, sir.

137
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,372
(Pop the will-o'-the-wisp balloon
with a toy hammer.)

138
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,292
We should burst them.

139
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:37,894
(Will-o'-the-wisp balloon?)

140
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,831
- There is...
- Is that the balloon?

141
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,599
Is that the will-o'-the-wisp balloon?

142
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:45,609
(The human will-o'-the-wisp)

143
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,465
(Actually, it wasn't a guy,)

144
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,106
(but a will-o'-the-wisp.)

145
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,904
(They are at a loss for words.)

146
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,289
They sound so happy.

147
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,325
They're delighted.

148
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,616
(They finally met him.)

149
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,702
(Ready with a toy hammer)

150
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:04,224
- We'll try.
- We'll try.

151
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,938
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:07,517
(A big stride)

153
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:10,053
(Apologies first, charging later)

154
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:13,270
(Feeling half bad, half happy)

155
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:14,808
Oh, my.

156
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,423
(No sound effects were added.)

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,711
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,089
(The goblin chasers swing
their hammers hard.)

159
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:20,580
I'm sorry!

160
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:22,144
Sorry.

161
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,483
It was so close!

162
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,270
(We need to win the fruits.)

163
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:28,688
(Get the goblin!)

164
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,724
(The goblin hunters are approaching
as they smile.)

165
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:32,444
I did it!

166
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,362
(It took them one minute.)

167
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

168
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,742
(The goblin chasers)

169
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,797
(Checking her looks)

170
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:42,402
It's the last period.

171
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,994
- They're really fast.
- They are.

172
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:44,971
We need to quiet down.

173
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,831
(Entering for the last class)

174
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:49,066
(Stealthily)

175
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,275
(Our teacher is asleep, right?)

176
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:54,271
(She's in a very deep sleep.)

177
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:56,030
Let's do it.

178
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,836
(Careful not to wake up the teacher)

179
00:07:00,284 --> 00:07:02,038
Do I lift it like this and go in?

180
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:02,888
Yes.

181
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:06,830
(The silence fell suddenly.)

182
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,439
I hear nothing now.

183
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,301
(It's the blanket session.)

184
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,399
They're whispering.

185
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,501
This one was hard.

186
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:17,637
- We took a long time with this.
- Yes.

187
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,674
(The first period: 3 minutes)

188
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,542
(The second period: 3 minutes)

189
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,555
(The third period:
1 minute and 30 seconds)

190
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:27,747
(Will they be able to finish
the fourth period quickly too?)

191
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,749
(Rehearsing thoroughly)

192
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,122
(JUUN gives it a try.)

193
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:34,387
(Sobbing)

194
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,701
(Going down like a sack of potatoes)

195
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,626
(Proving her zero-agility)

196
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,127
(Humble)

197
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:42,920
(What is she doing?)

198
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,202
(Holding back her laughter)

199
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:47,865
(Watch me, JUUN.)

200
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,855
(She threw herself on the blanket.)

201
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,507
(Her earmuffs are about to come off.)

202
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:56,309
(Bursting into laughter)

203
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,897
(This extreme bedtime mission requires
self-blanket collecting.)

204
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,106
(I heard someone laugh.)

205
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,496
(I must hold back laughter.)

206
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:06,416
(Teared up)

207
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,199
(The earmuffs are barely hanging on.)

208
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,389
(A sudden bolt up)

209
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,441
(The teacher has
such a terrible sleeping habit.)

210
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:17,594
(Falling back asleep)

211
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,285
(This is driving me crazy.)

212
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,471
(Trying again with gritted teeth.)

213
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,208
(Wriggling)

214
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,411
(A vigorous struggle
to cover her with the blanket)

215
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,180
(Flapping away so coldly)

216
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,817
(Welled up for her pathetic situation)

217
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,852
(Trembling)

218
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,289
(The tofu has turned red
with embarrassment.)

219
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,579
(Flapping)

220
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:46,360
(Plopping)

221
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,895
(I'm sorry, girls.)

222
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,573
(Almost passing out)

223
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,666
(I don't think we will get
to have fruits today.)

224
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,503
(A pathetic apology)

225
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,839
(Wailing)

226
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,675
It seems like they're trying their best.

227
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,611
They're trying hard to hold back laughter.

228
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,147
Oh, my. I can hear them.

229
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,416
Doing it itself is funny,

230
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,551
but watching the other do it
is even more funny.

231
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,738
I seriously can't hold back laughter,

232
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,572
- YE-ON?
- seeing YE-ON becoming a robot.

233
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:17,724
She'll act like a robot.

234
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,561
I also might crack up
when YE-ON shows her serious face.

235
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:25,131
YE-ON, I'm so worried.

236
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,600
We must hurry
as we're the last ones to go.

237
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,624
Yes, we should.

238
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:32,099
(The Chestnuts are still struggling hard.)

239
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,499
(Will she succeed this time?)

240
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:38,121
(Nothing has changed.)

241
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,896
(Disheveled)

242
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,216
(Take the earmuffs off, at least.)

243
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,785
(Wrecked)

244
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,687
(All I see is the blanket.)

245
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:48,922
(My turn)

246
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,590
(Lying down softly)

247
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,510
(She hasn't changed either.)

248
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,733
(The blanket nightmare)

249
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:59,599
(I'll make it, no matter what.)

250
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,135
(Flat)

251
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,838
(What?)

252
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,640
(She did it!)

253
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,610
(I made it, didn't I?)

254
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,680
(We nailed it!)

255
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,051
(As soon as the blanket caught her,
she bent her back quickly.)

256
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,588
(A success earned by giving up herself)

257
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,391
(Side effect: back pain)

258
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,315
(The last period is over.)

259
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,063
(Chuckling)

260
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,397
I just...

261
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:35,993
(Finding each other disheveled)

262
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,804
(Falling off)

263
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:40,106
(We've never had
such strange classes before.)

264
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:41,661
I guess it's over.

265
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:43,680
- Hey.
- Let's go.

266
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,903
CARMEN, STELLA, you can do it.

267
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,281
You should keep quiet
in the fourth period.

268
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,516
Be quiet in the fourth period.

269
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,276
Think about the fruits waiting for us.

270
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,066
- We can do it.
- Let's go.

271
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,155
- We can do it.
- We can make it.

272
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,024
(JUUN and YUHA are back from school.)

273
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,192
You made it really quickly.

274
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,027
We'll go and give it a shot!

275
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,762
- Bye!
- See you!

276
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,297
Let's go.

277
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,465
Let's give our all.

278
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,034
(Welcome to the Korean horror school.)

279
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:10,533
Okay. Let's get it.

280
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:12,172
- Let's get it.
- Let's go.

281
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:13,947
- Hello.
- Let's get it. This way.

282
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:14,822
This way?

283
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,577
- It's ping pong.
- I'm really bad at ping pong.

284
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,212
We can just give it a try.

285
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,448
Ping pong.

286
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,414
- It looks hard.
- We can do it.

287
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,252
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

288
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,378
- I don't think I can make it.
- Me either.

289
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:31,741
(STELLA, remember our operation.)

290
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,994
Let's finish the first period
really quickly.

291
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,774
Then, we can save some time
for the tongue twister,

292
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,532
the toughest one.

293
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,034
And we can speed up for the rest.

294
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:42,976
We're doomed.

295
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,370
Let's bang this out.

296
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:46,103
(The code name: Bang Out)

297
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:48,008
(CARMEN)

298
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,072
(Homer!)

299
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:50,570
We should hurry up.

300
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,861
We're running out of time.

301
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:53,434
I can do it.

302
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,994
(STELLA's spell: "I can do it.")

303
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:57,170
(CARMEN's support)

304
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,023
(STELLA's spell was very effective.)

305
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,622
(Five paper cups are knocked down.)

306
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,006
We did it!

307
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,126
Let's go. Thank you!

308
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,060
(Screaming)

309
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:10,530
(Taking big strides)

310
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,365
We got here sooner than we thought.

311
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,535
(The Korean horror school isn't so bad.)

312
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:16,903
(Goblin's surprise)

313
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,372
Watch out!

314
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,140
This is no good.

315
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,580
(She enters the classroom
with STELLA, who freaked out.)

316
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,011
It's okay.

317
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:27,547
Is this the right place? Are you sure?

318
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:30,165
- Is this the place?
- I think so.

319
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,375
(Second period: Korean)

320
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,754
I'm bad at tongue twisters.

321
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:36,295
Okay.

322
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,225
If it requires fluent Korean,
it must be hard for me.

323
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,326
Same here.

324
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:44,267
(Relatively easier questions
are selected.)

325
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:45,898
If...

326
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:49,269
If two witches would watch two watches...

327
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,671
Surely Sylvia swims Swiss...

328
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,207
- It's "swiftly."
- Swiftly.

329
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,310
Sylvia surely swims.

330
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,589
(STELLA: Korean teacher of the day)

331
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,281
- Do you think I can do it?
- Good?

332
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,561
- Or do you want to try this one?
- Yours?

333
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,152
- Can I?
- Let's switch.

334
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:08,288
Oh, gosh.

335
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,164
(She gave the easier one to CARMEN.)

336
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,558
Do you get it?

337
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,675
Yes.

338
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:16,763
Two witches would watch...

339
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:18,524
CARMEN sounds so cute.

340
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:20,537
"Two witches would watch."

341
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:22,602
- We don't have time, so let's try.
- Okay.

342
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:23,920
We can do it.

343
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,260
I'll try.

344
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,740
Surely Sylvia swims swiftly,

345
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,543
Sylvia surely swims.

346
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,645
And when Sylvia swims...

347
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:34,414
(She didn't make the cloud motion.)

348
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,799
(Too late)

349
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,050
- I'll try.
- Let's go.

350
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:38,985
Two witches would...

351
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,222
watch two watches,

352
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,393
which witch would watch which watch?

353
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,596
Or which witch would...

354
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,623
watch witches chat?

355
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:56,069
(CARMEN pulled it off.)

356
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,504
I better hurry up.

357
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,575
Surely Sylvia swims swiftly,

358
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,512
Sylvia surely swims.

359
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,795
And when Sylvia swims...

360
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,701
(Will STELLA make it this time?)

361
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:15,154
And when Sylvia swims,

362
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:18,991
she surely swims swiftly.

363
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,661
- We made it!
- Hey!

364
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,629
Let's run!

365
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,132
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

366
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,867
They're having the third period now.

367
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,936
- They made it, anyway!
- I'm happy for them.

368
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,305
- Where?
- This way.

369
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:35,341
(Gasp)

370
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,542
Hi.

371
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,077
Sorry.

372
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,580
(Apologies first, charging later)

373
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:42,906
(The third round of goblin's suffering)

374
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,608
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

375
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:49,032
(They hold the goblin tight
and strike him with precision.)

376
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,058
(The goblin slipped.)

377
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,563
I'm sorry.

378
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,962
(CARMEN also cleared the mission.)

379
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,118
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

380
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:58,564
Maybe we were too mean.

381
00:14:58,588 --> 00:14:59,932
(Fourth period: Roll call)

382
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,301
The fourth period.

383
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,926
(Frozen)

384
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,430
(Finally, it's the roll call.)

385
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:07,932
(Sleeping)

386
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,210
(Sneaking in)

387
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,213
(Checking on the teacher)

388
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,850
(STELLA goes first.)

389
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,752
(Hands in the air!)

390
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,888
(Crashing into the floor)

391
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,556
(Bursting into laughter)

392
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,191
(Eager eyes know nothing but success.)

393
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,727
(Wriggling)

394
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,897
(She carefully picks up the blanket.)

395
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,400
(In 1, 2... Here I go.)

396
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,836
(Right into the blanket)

397
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,306
(CARMEN pulled it off on the first try.)

398
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,709
(The joyful hand gesture)

399
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,744
(They cleared the final mission.)

400
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,547
(Good night, ma'am.)

401
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,584
(The CA-STELLA duo finishes classes
in the shortest time.)

402
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,240
How did you finish it so fast?

403
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:53,707
I did it in one go.

404
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:55,088
We should hurry.

405
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,491
- Let's go now.
- Go on. You got this.

406
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:00,077
(Will they be able to return
in 14 minutes?)

407
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,795
Be careful not to fall.

408
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,830
Be safe.

409
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:06,066
- Let's swing it together.
- Let's do this.

410
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:07,884
We don't have time for this.

411
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:10,027
Let's go.

412
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:13,150
(Run!)

413
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,208
There are stairs.

414
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:18,245
- My feet are frozen.
- We might fall.

415
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,381
I think we can do it in an hour.

416
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:22,949
- Yes.
- I think we can.

417
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,737
(From the start, YE-ON had only one goal.)

418
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:28,732
(How much time do we have left?)

419
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,791
Ping-pong must be fun.

420
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,816
(While her partner was pursuing pleasure,)

421
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,788
Since we're last...

422
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:38,475
(the goal-driven youngest
was worried about making it in time.)

423
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,652
(Will they be able to return
in 15 minutes?)

424
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:43,320
(Entering the school)

425
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,638
I'm scared of this kind of thing.

426
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:46,506
- I thought that was a ghost.
- Look here.

427
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,575
Oh, my gosh! What was that?

428
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,059
(Calm and composed)

429
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,979
(She guides IAN with a smile.)

430
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,313
Where do we go?

431
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,167
I think it's this way.

432
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:57,219
What is this?

433
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:01,888
"Use a ping pong ball to knock down
more than five cups on the other side."

434
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,457
(Bouncing)

435
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,458
(Weak ball)

436
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,860
(Zero accuracy)

437
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,395
(Figuring out a strategy)

438
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,563
(I must knock down five paper cups.)

439
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:11,644
(Attacking with a straight drive)

440
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,167
(Straight to the cups)

441
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,702
(Demolished)

442
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,971
(Hitting three cups splendidly
with a stroke)

443
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,274
(A loud reaction isn't needed.
She's fully focused.)

444
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,609
(In the meantime, IAN also hits one!)

445
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:23,869
We're good at this!

446
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:26,980
(An error)

447
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:28,876
(Another error in a row.)

448
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,151
(IAN's smash)

449
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,154
(She hit two more.)

450
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,387
- We did it.
- It's a success.

451
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,789
Let's go.

452
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,891
- What's next?
- We go up to the second floor.

453
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,681
The school is big.

454
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,673
Hey, slow down. I'm scared.

455
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,970
- I see here's another camera.
- Hey!

456
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:45,999
What was that noise?

457
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,108
You startled me.

458
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:48,945
- It's the camera operator.
- That's not what I was saying.

459
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,205
I'm scared of mirrors.
Something might just pop out from them.

460
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,208
- Where is it? Is it here?
- I think it's this way.

461
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,701
(Even darker for the last team)

462
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,079
Oh, come on...

463
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:00,614
Do we have to go into the classroom?

464
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,078
Are you sure it's here?

465
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,247
(Freaking out)

466
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,953
(Screaming)

467
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:08,843
What?

468
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,390
- Why are they screaming so loudly?
- Where are they now?

469
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,958
I think they're at that point.

470
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:14,561
- That was pretty scary.
- That freaked me out the most.

471
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,543
(I agree.)

472
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,668
(Replaying that startled part)

473
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,418
(Screaming out of their lungs)

474
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,436
- Come on!
- Let's go this way.

475
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:25,171
That scared me.

476
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:26,997
Seriously...

477
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:29,766
- There's something here.
- Don't leave me behind.

478
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:31,378
"Left shoulder?"

479
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,043
(Moving shoulders is essential for IAN.)

480
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:36,019
"A little bunny's ears above my head?"

481
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,150
(Pronunciation is crucial for YE-ON.)

482
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,293
Should we practice for about 30 seconds?

483
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:46,074
"Among royal scorched rice water,
burnt..."

484
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:47,978
(She has to learn as much as she can!)

485
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:49,545
(Busy all by herself)

486
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,235
(She's not deactivated.)

487
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:52,933
A little bunny's ears above my head.

488
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:53,967
(Motion data input)

489
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,136
(Processing the little bunny's ears)

490
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,428
- "Always rich." Okay.
- Should we give it a go?

491
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,807
- In 1, 2, 3. We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

492
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,411
A little bunny's bunny poop is...

493
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,279
in the big bunny's bunny poop.

494
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,616
A big bunny's poop is
in the little bunny's bunny poop.

495
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,088
(Failed)

496
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,819
(Going for the second try right away)

497
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,888
A little bunny's bunny poop is...

498
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,656
- in the big bunny's bunny poop.
- You failed.

499
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:18,435
(Output error)

500
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:20,194
What did I do wrong?

501
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,232
When you make the motion for this phrase,

502
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:27,067
What's the little bunny's ears?

503
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,645
A little bunny's ears.

504
00:19:28,728 --> 00:19:30,479
- What about the big bunny one?
- A big bunny's ears.

505
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,337
Okay.

506
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:35,552
Shouldn't you distinguish the two?

507
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:36,977
What do you mean?

508
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:39,446
When you make the motion,

509
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:42,849
use your fingers for the little one
and your hands for the big one.

510
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,963
(Data for a big bunny and a little bunny
is entered.)

511
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:48,855
- In 1, 2, 3. We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

512
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:53,627
A little bunny's bunny poop is
in the big bunny's bunny bucket.

513
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:56,881
A big bunny's poop is
in the little bunny's...

514
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,440
Bunny's poop...

515
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,574
I mean, "bunny's bucket."

516
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,311
(She almost got it but failed.)

517
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,436
You got this. In 1, 2, 3!

518
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,286
I'll go.

519
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:08,082
A little bunny's bunny poop is
in the big bunny's...

520
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:09,448
Bunny poop is...

521
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,759
- in the little bunny's bunny bucket.
- You got it wrong.

522
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,704
Come on, YE-ON. Let's go again.

523
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:15,554
I'll go.

524
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:16,653
(IAN tries first.)

525
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,229
Among royal scorched rice water,

526
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:21,838
burnt royal scorched rice water is...

527
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:23,390
always rich.

528
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,068
A little bunny's bunny poop is...

529
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:29,696
in the big bunny's bunny bucket.

530
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,298
A big bunny's poop is...

531
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,768
in the little bunny's bunny bucket.

532
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,103
Yes! Thank you!

533
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,439
Let's move, YE-ON.

534
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,867
We have to do it in an hour to eat beef.

535
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,443
Can you open the door for me?

536
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,363
Thank you.

537
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,523
(Bang! She's so strong.)

538
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,207
(The youngest duo makes them
laugh out loud.)

539
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:50,927
- "Can you get the door for me?"
- She's so...

540
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:52,152
(Chatty IAN and stiff robot YE-ON)

541
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:54,371
Can you open the door for me?

542
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:55,722
Thank you.

543
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,757
Bye now.

544
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,493
Where is it?

545
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,362
(The goblin dashes out to greet them.)

546
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,000
(IAN gets her heart in her mouth
while following YE-ON.)

547
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:10,997
(She's scared to death.)

548
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:13,874
(She grabs the youngest and runs away.)

549
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,043
(The robot is pushed by IAN.)

550
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,678
I don't think we're supposed to come here.

551
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:22,137
- We have to clear the third mission.
- I'm sorry.

552
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:23,433
What's in there?

553
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,836
(She grabs onto YE-ON
and enters the room.)

554
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:27,414
(Third period: Creative activity)

555
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,461
Hello.

556
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,023
Hello.

557
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,624
Are we allowed to use this?

558
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:33,650
Will you be all right?

559
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,028
I apologize in advance.

560
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:36,695
(Sudden attack)

561
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:40,532
(YE-ON's madman mode is switched on.)

562
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,933
(I'm afraid we're running out of time.)

563
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:44,170
I'm sorry!

564
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:45,431
(Moaning)

565
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,741
It won't pop, though.

566
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:49,600
(Struggling to survive)

567
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,515
(The customers are satisfied.)

568
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,096
(Panting)

569
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:54,247
This is hilarious.

570
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,649
We should attack
from both sides to pop it.

571
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:57,917
I'll block him from here.

572
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:00,553
(Pop)

573
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,746
- Are you okay?
- You succeeded.

574
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:03,690
I'm sorry.

575
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,222
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

576
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:07,517
- You did it.
- Yes.

577
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,852
(Straight to the fourth mission)

578
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,327
(Let's hurry.)

579
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:12,313
(We have to be under the blanket.)

580
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:13,750
(Okay.)

581
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,270
(It should be done quietly and swiftly.)

582
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,240
I'll just throw it in the air.

583
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,242
(IAN goes first.)

584
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,612
(What a modest diver.)

585
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,747
(Embarrassed)

586
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,516
(She witnessed IAN's failure.)

587
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:30,884
(Holding in the laughter)

588
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,719
(Clenching her lips)

589
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:36,022
(Let's focus and do it seriously.)

590
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,941
(In a very straight position)

591
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:41,438
(The robot even has straight spines.)

592
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,840
(She almost burst into a laugh.)

593
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,600
(The teacher is a light sleeper.)

594
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,536
(IAN manages to hold the laugh
and gets ready again.)

595
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:53,407
(The second attempt also fails.)

596
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:54,708
(Frozen)

597
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,176
(Shush!)

598
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,545
(YE-ON tries again
before the teacher wakes up.)

599
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,125
(She made a thud sound and failed.)

600
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,526
(Dispirited)

601
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,633
(This is too funny.)

602
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:12,826
(Getting rid of the smile)

603
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,349
(She's perfectly covered
except for her hair.)

604
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:22,619
(Find YE-ON if you can!)

605
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:23,509
I did it.

606
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:27,357
(The robot set the successful frequency.)

607
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:30,340
(Oh, right!)

608
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,550
(Good night!)

609
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:35,939
(The fourth period is complete.)

610
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:36,950
Are we done?

611
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:38,518
I think so.

612
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:40,220
We did it so quickly.

613
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:43,059
(Relieved)

614
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,058
We're done!

615
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:47,293
Watch your steps.

616
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,662
That was really quick.

617
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,331
Let's ring the bell together.

618
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,969
- Good work.
- Well done.

619
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,300
(Every H2H member...)

620
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,471
Thank you.

621
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:00,306
(cleared the missions
at the abandoned school.)

622
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:02,575
- Wasn't it fun?
- Yes. Weren't we fast?

623
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,335
I feel so sorry for that man
from the third period.

624
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:06,736
Me too.

625
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:07,914
I felt so bad for him.

626
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:09,996
How was the fourth period?

627
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,384
In the fourth period,

628
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:13,152
YE-ON was like...

629
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,289
(Straight spines, straight posture)

630
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,780
- Did she slay it?
- It was hilarious for me,

631
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,759
but YE-ON didn't laugh, not once.

632
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:21,995
- You didn't laugh, YE-ON?
- No.

633
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,531
I was more focused
on finishing the mission.

634
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:27,500
- That's so YE-ON.
- That's so funny.

635
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,935
My earmuffs came off,

636
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,217
and I went crazy in the fourth period.

637
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:34,352
I tried so hard not to laugh
at the sight of you.

638
00:24:34,377 --> 00:24:37,560
Your earmuffs were down here
like a blindfold.

639
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:40,150
(Girls, thanks for your hard work!)

640
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:41,814
We were pretty quick, right?

641
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:43,383
I'm not sure.

642
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:44,807
(How long did they take?)

643
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:47,654
I think they came in the nick of time.

644
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,025
(Curious)

645
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:50,323
I'll tell you the seconds first.

646
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,091
- Okay.
- It's 52 seconds.

647
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,261
It's 52 seconds?

648
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,163
And the minute.

649
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:00,418
Five minutes.

650
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,577
- Five?
- The last digit is five?

651
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:04,924
- Is it 55 minutes?
- Is it 55 minutes?

652
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,907
Maybe it's 65 minutes.

653
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:10,853
- It has to be 55 minutes.
- It could be 55 minutes.

654
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,269
(The fruits are at stake.)

655
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:13,971
(What's the result
of the last teamwork mission?)

656
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,582
It's 75 minutes and 52 seconds.

657
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:19,427
We didn't make it.
It took more than an hour.

658
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:20,653
I see.

659
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,657
But since you worked so hard,
we'll let you have...

660
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,411
(A small gift from the staff to H2H)

661
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:27,360
strawberries.

662
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:30,547
(They got the strawberries
that they wanted the most!)

663
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:32,355
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

664
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,522
- They're so big!
- The strawberries are huge!

665
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,369
- Barbecue party!
- We did well.

666
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,636
It's a barbecue party.

667
00:25:38,822 --> 00:25:42,232
(Chef JIWOO grills the meat.)

668
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,194
(The baby birds can't take
their eyes off.)

669
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,738
(But it's understandable
because they did...)

670
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,318
(the "Perfect Pitch Game,")

671
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,087
("Spot the Liar,")

672
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,598
(the ten-minute grocery shopping,)

673
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,027
- YE-ON!
- YE-ON!

674
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,127
(and the three other missions in a day.)

675
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:03,820
(Of course, they're hungry.)

676
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:05,631
It looks delicious.

677
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:07,767
I think you can eat it now.

678
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:10,720
- Thank you, JIWOO.
- Thanks.

679
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,323
(Escaping the grill)

680
00:26:13,348 --> 00:26:15,263
- Be careful.
- Oh, no.

681
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:16,537
(The meat is a bit burnt.)

682
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:20,236
(They're a bit taken aback by its look.)

683
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,452
(However, it can't be helped.)

684
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,142
(On the way to the camping ground)

685
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,404
(Worried and anxious)

686
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:33,292
Does anyone know how to grill meat?

687
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,946
(The average age of H2H is 17 years old.)

688
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,831
- No.
- No one knows.

689
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:42,535
- I never cooked meat.
- Neither did I.

690
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,550
If I cook it, I might ruin it.

691
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:49,039
(She really did speak it
into existence again.)

692
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:51,027
(Don't worry.)

693
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,280
(I'm operating on this meat.)

694
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,615
(Dr. YUHA,
She gets rid of burnt parts of meat.)

695
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:59,686
(Everyone is watching
the crucial operation.)

696
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:01,421
It's a little tough.

697
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,646
(While Dr. YUHA performs surgery)

698
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,432
Look at the beef.

699
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,661
I absolutely love beef.

700
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:10,761
(The beef lover tries grilling
the Korean beef.)

701
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,334
(Beef is always right.)

702
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,736
JIWOO, you're good with meat.

703
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:18,438
Thank you for the work.

704
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:19,943
(Feeling proud)

705
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,675
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

706
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:23,676
It's ready.

707
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:28,681
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you!

708
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,189
(It makes them smile the moment
they put meat into their mouths.)

709
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,414
(It's more delicious after hard work.)

710
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:40,626
- Is it good?
- Thanks.

711
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:42,786
(JUUN takes a bite.)

712
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,747
(IAN also takes a bite.)

713
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:46,542
(Elated)

714
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:48,901
It's so good.

715
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:51,548
(Beef for JIWOO, who worked hard)

716
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:53,552
You like it?

717
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:55,741
Is it good?

718
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:57,143
It's delicious.

719
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,579
(The beef is so good!)

720
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,006
I'm happy.

721
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:03,938
- This heals my soul.
- I agree.

722
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,054
Shooting our first reality show
all together made me feel...

723
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,756
we were really connected as a team,
and it was fun.

724
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,246
(She couldn't agree more.)

725
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:15,328
What did you enjoy most
out of the three missions?

726
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:16,621
The second round for me.

727
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:18,931
- Me too.
- The second round was fun.

728
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:21,300
JUUN did an excellent job acting out,

729
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,402
and the members in the middle
also did great.

730
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:26,806
- Watching the weird actions was funny.
- Yes.

731
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:28,941
YUHA did really well with guessing them.

732
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:31,577
- It was fun because YUHA got them right.
- Right.

733
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,846
I also enjoyed
the ten-minute grocery shopping.

734
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,581
- Oh, right.
- Yes, it was fun.

735
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:39,101
That really came to me
as a variety show content.

736
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:40,781
I liked the horror school.

737
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,924
It was so fascinating
to experience something...

738
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:45,844
- I only saw on TV.
- Me too.

739
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,681
During that mission, I felt so bad...

740
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:50,454
for the man we smashed
with a toy hammer in the third period.

741
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,712
Today felt like a getaway
from the usual training sessions.

742
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:55,968
Yes, it was recharging.

743
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,738
- Now, I think I can work harder.
- Right.

744
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:01,078
I hoped we could do our show someday...

745
00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:03,576
as I watched other people
doing their shows.

746
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:06,977
And now that I'm actually doing it,

747
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,759
- it feels surreal.
- Yes.

748
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,088
Also, I never thought...

749
00:29:11,112 --> 00:29:14,020
I'd explore a closed school in my life.

750
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,125
I really enjoyed it
and the barbecue party afterward.

751
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:21,594
As we keep carrying on our careers,

752
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:23,162
I hope we can look back...

753
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,798
on our cherishing moments like today
during hard times...

754
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:29,401
and we always stay as a joyful team.

755
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:31,503
Way to go.

756
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:34,040
Hi, Mom and Dad!

757
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:37,009
I'm on TV!

758
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,609
(Their first camping trip in life
is over.)

759
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:41,647
Strawberries are delicious. Try them.

760
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,837
(Saving the data
of Hearts2Hearts' first camping trip)

761
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:45,005
(The data is saved.)

762
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:46,419
(Do you wish to see their other stories?)

763
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,422
(H2H in Jeju)

764
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:52,992
(In Jeju, they're much more gorgeous...)

765
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,029
(and funnier than ever.)

766
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,698
(And the upgraded self-introductions too!)

767
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:00,567
(Maybe Jeju is where H2H belongs!)

768
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:03,486
We prepared
the first Chat Hearts2Hearts MV Awards.

769
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:04,804
(Chat Hearts2Hearts reveals...)

770
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:07,226
(the behind-scenes footage
of "The Chase" music video.)

771
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,609
(The MVP will have the trophy
in her hand.)

772
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,247
(Unprecedented chaotic awards ceremony)

773
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:16,917
(Who will win in the first H2H Awards?)

774
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,568
(Find out in the next episode!)
