1
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:01,854
(Show me the JI-AN Duo's Partner Course!)

2
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:03,773
Gosh!

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,172
I've never been to such a place.

4
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:06,165
Unbelievable.

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,905
I guess that's it, the mosquito net.

6
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,266
Mosquito net?

7
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,069
Isn't this a mosquito net?

8
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,514
Awesome.

9
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,252
(The ultimate hotspot
popular with every Gen-Z)

10
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,315
(The trampoline park,
an activity paradise)

11
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:21,812
- It looks fun.
- It looks so much fun.

12
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:24,658
(You can enhance your chemistry
with your friend here.)

13
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:28,695
(Stretching is crucial for safety!)

14
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,723
(What's their Partner Mission here?)

15
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:31,769
Actually,

16
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,468
I loved this kind of activity a lot
when I was little.

17
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,202
That's right.

18
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,875
I've become introverted as I grew up.

19
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,740
- Now, I'm a homebody.
- Really?

20
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,609
I used to stay outside all the time.

21
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,768
I went out to have fun
every time I had a chance.

22
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:47,548
- I feel like a kid again.
- That's right.

23
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:50,607
Someone is there.

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,887
- Oh, my!
- He's waiting for us!

25
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,156
It's been such a long time
since I went on this.

26
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,625
Let me explain the basic jump.

27
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,061
Push off the surface and jump up.

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,430
And when you're in the air,
raise your arms.

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,767
I haven't tried this for such a long time!

30
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,802
Same here. It's been a minute.

31
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:13,203
(The perfect height and posture)

32
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:14,675
It's so fun.

33
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,410
- It really is.
- Right?

34
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,911
I love this!

35
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,746
- Are you used to it now?
- Yes.

36
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,672
Let's learn jump variations.

37
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,934
Tap your knees!

38
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,546
(Level 1: Tapping knees)

39
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:27,821
Jump and touch your toes!

40
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:29,094
(Level 2: Touching toes)

41
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,677
Stretch your legs forward.

42
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,407
You'll make a diamond in the air.

43
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:39,082
(JIWOO tires it
as soon as the explanation is over.)

44
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,415
(Tapping)

45
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:44,404
That's right. You're doing very well.

46
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,103
(The posture is perfect like a pro.)

47
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:47,140
IAN!

48
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:48,909
IAN!

49
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,410
IAN!

50
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:53,310
(The promotion fairy in the area)

51
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:54,770
(Promoting herself)

52
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:55,837
(Tapping her knees)

53
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,850
(She's super busy.)

54
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,987
The next jump is called a straddle jump.

55
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,626
(Input, output)

56
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:05,396
(Art score: perfect,
Jump score: perfect)

57
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:06,560
You did really well!

58
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,862
- IAN!
- IAN!

59
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:10,497
- You pulled it off!
- You're doing really great!

60
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:12,799
I'm doing pretty well!

61
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,168
(Third try)

62
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,667
(In trance)

63
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:17,304
(Fourth try)

64
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,271
(Fifth try)

65
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:19,403
(Never-ending)

66
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:19,973
(Sixth try)

67
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:23,113
(Sudden flirting)

68
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,548
That was awesome!

69
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:27,314
How did you do that?
I guess you have strong muscles.

70
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:28,335
Again.

71
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,783
(IAN gives it a try.)

72
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,485
(Plopping down)

73
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,187
(It's just that JIWOO is so good at it.)

74
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,490
How did you do that? Show me again.

75
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,059
Get up as soon as you touch the floor.

76
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,030
Get up!

77
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,436
Make a diamond together in the air.

78
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,971
Do you think we can do it?

79
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,205
What if I end up kicking you?

80
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,808
Ready and jump.

81
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,698
(Let's show our friendship to everyone.)

82
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,413
In 2, 3.

83
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:02,716
(It's become a real diamond gem.)

84
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,452
Lift your arms higher this time.

85
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:07,888
In 2, 3.

86
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:10,714
(They successfully made a diamond.)

87
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,392
Great job.

88
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:14,394
(Proud)

89
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,353
(The Eager Beavers's Partner Mission:
Time-attack race!)

90
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,356
(Complete the three missions
in three minutes!)

91
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,199
(The first mission: Hurdle relay race)

92
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,138
(Finish the obstacle course race
as fast as possible!)

93
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,909
(The second Mission:
3 times of simultaneous sit-drop)

94
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,759
Good!

95
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,478
(The third mission:
Take a photo of a heart pose!)

96
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,022
(They can try infinitely within time.)

97
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,481
(The mission is complete
with a bell ring.)

98
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,317
(If they succeed in the missions
in 3 minutes, they get a Friendship Item.)

99
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,385
We must make it.

100
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,020
I'll go first.

101
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,556
Okay, then I'll go next. We can do this.

102
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,725
We must keep a cool head,
especially for the heart mission.

103
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,081
What was this?

104
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,584
- You just need to run through it.
- Okay.

105
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,297
- We can do it.
- We'll show you!

106
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,699
- We're rising talents in variety scenes.
- Rising talents in variety scenes.

107
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,935
- JIWOO.
- IAN.

108
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,069
- Cross!
- Cross!

109
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:58,872
- We can do this.
- Shouldn't we say our own names?

110
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,841
- IAN.
- JIWOO.

111
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,775
- Cross!
- Cross!

112
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,443
I'll run really fast.

113
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,314
I'm not sure if I can run fast.
It's narrower than it looks.

114
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,683
Play safely,
and make sure you don't get hurt.

115
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:11,778
JIWOO starts!

116
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,570
(The three-minute time-attack begins.)

117
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,620
JIWOO starts!

118
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,494
There she goes!

119
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,961
(Lips pressed)

120
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,030
(Running without hesitation)

121
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:23,964
You can do it!

122
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:27,398
(Running through with her long legs)

123
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:30,704
I'm the problem here.
I don't think I can pass it fast.

124
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,107
You're doing great!

125
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:36,445
Wait!

126
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,678
You can do it!

127
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,147
Take it easy. You're doing well.

128
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,212
(Returning to the right track swiftly)

129
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,483
You can do it!

130
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,552
I'm scared.

131
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,592
Hurry up!

132
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:47,801
Hey!

133
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:49,222
(Rushing)

134
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,861
You're fast, IAN.

135
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,092
Am I?

136
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:55,161
(She's like a bird
outside the trampoline.)

137
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,463
Let me go in. Hi.

138
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,300
You finished it really quickly.

139
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:02,969
- Three times?
- Yes.

140
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,809
(It's important to succeed at once.)

141
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,108
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

142
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:09,910
(First sit-drop was successful.)

143
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,416
(They start with the combination.)

144
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,515
(Second sit-drop was successful.)

145
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:18,682
(They now need to succeed
just one more time.)

146
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:20,276
Okay!

147
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,079
Good. What do we do now?

148
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,340
I should set it.

149
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,858
- The timer?
- Yes. Come here.

150
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,792
No, you stay there.

151
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,162
(Setting the timer)

152
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,630
Ten, nine,

153
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,599
- eight, seven,
- eight, seven,

154
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,627
(They need to ring the bell
to complete the mission.)

155
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,203
- four, three,
- four, three,

156
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,838
- two, one.
- two, one.

157
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:40,526
Let's go and check.

158
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:42,782
(Checking the photo first)

159
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:44,234
(But she returns midway)

160
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:45,679
It's okay.

161
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:47,314
Let's check it first.

162
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:48,492
(Bell ringing)

163
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,314
(Shaking with a cheery face)

164
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,552
(It's over before checking the picture.)

165
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:53,975
- It's okay. I'm sure we made it.
- Of course.

166
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:54,865
I have a feeling.

167
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:57,200
(It too 2 minutes and 30 seconds.)

168
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,408
(It's a pass!)

169
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:01,185
(If they made a heart in the photo,
they pass!)

170
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:02,739
(There's no heart.)

171
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:03,697
You failed.

172
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,597
(They were standing so straight
that they can't even deny it.)

173
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:08,901
No way.

174
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,504
It's forged.

175
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,299
(They check the photo again,
but it's an obvious failure.)

176
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,344
- We failed.
- Don't we get a second chance?

177
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:19,012
(The first-ever failure
of Partner Mission)

178
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,915
(They kneeled down so humbly.)

179
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,760
Please give us another chance.

180
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,652
- We're so frustrated.
- Yes, we are.

181
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:28,058
Just one more chance.

182
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,157
We can't give you another chance
for nothing.

183
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,233
What can you show us in return?

184
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,030
- I guess this is how it goes.
- What should we do?

185
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:39,833
- What can we do here?
- Can you roll on this?

186
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,069
I can do that. But would that be enough?

187
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,604
No, it's not enough.

188
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,708
Then, what about the jump we just learned?

189
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:50,009
(Declined right away)

190
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,277
I can do a Doraemon impression.

191
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:55,148
- You're dressed just like Doraemon.
- Since I'm Doraemon,

192
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,683
I'll imitate its voice.

193
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,518
Make sure you laugh
even if I don't sound like it.

194
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:01,105
(Even her back looks resolute.)

195
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,614
(Getting her throat ready)

196
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:05,362
(A huge party trick is coming, for sure.)

197
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:08,278
(Here comes Doraemon.)

198
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,007
(I can't watch this.)

199
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,471
Please listen to "The Chase" a lot!

200
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:15,413
(The promotion fairy
never misses a chance.)

201
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:17,220
(Reality check)

202
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:19,697
(They got a second chance!)

203
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:20,740
We can do it!

204
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:22,887
Let's check the photo
after making a heart.

205
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,077
We must check it.

206
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:25,004
We can make it.

207
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,781
- We'll give it a second shot!
- We'll try now.

208
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:29,866
(The last try)

209
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,184
I sounded a bit funny, though.

210
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,739
IAN earned this chance
with her impersonation.

211
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,322
- I won't miss this chance.
- I won't miss it.

212
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,856
- IAN.
- JIWOO.

213
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,111
- Cross!
- Cross!

214
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:38,985
Let's go!

215
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,018
(The last try!)

216
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:42,735
There she goes!

217
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,780
(Dashing)

218
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,328
(Rocket Tarzan)

219
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:48,318
Since she's running really fast,
I can take my time.

220
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,621
(Entering the sandbag zone where she fell)

221
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:53,323
(Careful not to be pushed back)

222
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,508
(IAN's turn)

223
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,444
- You can do it, IAN.
- Let's go.

224
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,775
(IAN's tremendous speed)

225
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,266
Hi!

226
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,449
You're so relaxed
that you even waved your hand.

227
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:04,942
(Extrovert IAN cleared the zone easily.)

228
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,320
(Getting through the last zone
in an instant)

229
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,170
Let's go.

230
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,456
(She reduced time by ten seconds.)

231
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,458
- We just need to pull this off.
- Right.

232
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,426
- We can do it.
- We just have the last mission.

233
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,490
Yes.

234
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:16,296
(Mission 2:
3 times of simultaneous sit-drop)

235
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,665
In 1, 2, 3.

236
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,565
(The first success)

237
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:22,869
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

238
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,839
(The second success)

239
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,863
(Perfect teamwork)

240
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,209
(The third success)

241
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,111
- Count the number as you come back.
- Okay.

242
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:32,829
(The last mission: Make a heart shape)

243
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,114
Ready, start!

244
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:36,914
(The human timer)

245
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,419
Seven, six,

246
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,454
five, four,

247
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:44,391
(Will they make it at the precise time
this time?)

248
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,693
Let's go check.

249
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,128
(Checking the photo first)

250
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,265
- We made it!
- We did!

251
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,634
(The human heart is taking off!)

252
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,970
(The chimer girl is excited.)

253
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,640
(The mission is complete!)

254
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,608
(How long did they take
for the 3-minute time-attack race?)

255
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,219
(Two minutes!)

256
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,811
- We did it so well.
- We were so fast.

257
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,879
Success!

258
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,448
(JIWOO and IAN completed
the Partner Mission!)

259
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:11,275
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

260
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:13,450
"I." It's IAN!

261
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,821
It's customized!

262
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,677
It's our matching items.

263
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,668
- The first matching items.
- I'm delighted.

264
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:21,952
- Thank you!
- Please listen to "The Chase" a lot!

265
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:27,300
It's so pretty.

266
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,637
(Show me STELLA and YE-ON's
Partner Course!)

267
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,911
(The hint photo is a baking tool.)

268
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,547
(While baking cookies together,)

269
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,349
(they'll grow their friendship bigger.)

270
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,473
You'll begin the Partner Mission
of the Partner's Day.

271
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:50,173
(Of course, it's not simple baking.)

272
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,459
It's a battle for cookie shape!

273
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,327
- Cookie shape?
- Cookie shape?

274
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:58,164
Now, the battle of the two, who dream
of becoming the masters...

275
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,266
of cookie-shaping, begins.

276
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,970
You'll receive five keywords each...

277
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,006
and make the shapes of them
using your pastry bags.

278
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,976
We have a three-SMCHELIN-starred judge,

279
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,979
and the one with more precise shapes
gets to win.

280
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,283
My mom liked baking when I was young.

281
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,420
So, I've done it too, watching her,
since I was little.

282
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,788
I'm sure I can win.

283
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,758
STELLA learned her baking skills
from her mother.

284
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,028
I've also made egg tarts and cookies...

285
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,866
as a hobby when I was young.

286
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,602
I think I can do this too.

287
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,637
I'll win, no matter what.

288
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,508
YE-ON has polished up her baking skills
since elementary school.

289
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,978
Who will be the final winner?

290
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:49,433
(Cookie Shape Class War)

291
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,978
(They're even wearing
the opposite colors of aprons.)

292
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,104
(Plan cookie, chocolate cookie)

293
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,990
- Hi.
- Hello.

294
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:58,795
(She'll teach them baking techniques.)

295
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,912
- You'll make egg cookies today.
- Okay.

296
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:05,151
(Mission: Make a batter for egg cookies.)

297
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,057
(Very calm)

298
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:09,699
(It looks neat, like YE-ON,
the textbook girl.)

299
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:11,408
(A bowl for egg shells)

300
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,810
(She almost lost her ingredients
right from the start.)

301
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,275
You'll mix them now.

302
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:17,087
(Roughly measuring it)

303
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:20,013
(STELLA measures it at once
without hesitation.)

304
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:21,481
(Scooping)

305
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,016
(Scooping)

306
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,818
(YE-ON measures the flour very carefully.)

307
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,821
You're very careful.

308
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:31,401
(Adding 7g of flavoring)

309
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,827
- I added eight grams. Is it okay?
- Yes, it's okay.

310
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,397
(She's definitely a cool girl.)

311
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,701
You're shaking.

312
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,404
- I'm being careful.
- It's all right.

313
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,707
(It's time to mix the ingredients.)

314
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,810
How long should I stir this?

315
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,714
(It's has just begun.)

316
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:57,751
(Mixing with all her might)

317
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,420
- Your arm hurts, right?
- A little.

318
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,558
It requires lots of arm strength.

319
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:08,595
It's harder than exercising.

320
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,122
(A sudden muscle workout)

321
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,701
(Workout of the day complete)

322
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:17,937
Squeeze it, following the lines.

323
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,763
(Round and dotting)

324
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,641
(Neat)

325
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,578
It's getting bigger and bigger.

326
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,448
(Small and consistent, Getting bigger)

327
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,617
Mine is getting bigger.

328
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,988
(How will they do in the real battle?)

329
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,024
(A battle for cookie shape)

330
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,260
(Cookie Shape Class War begins!)

331
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,695
I'll give you the keyword cards.

332
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,545
Okay.

333
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,378
It's too hard.

334
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,905
Oh, my. I'm doomed.

335
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,939
I got a dog bone,

336
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:59,512
a bunny, Rudolph, a dragon, and a dog.

337
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:00,613
Those are very hard.

338
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:03,082
The trickiest one here is...

339
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:04,716
a dragon.

340
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,886
I have to think a lot...

341
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,689
to come up with the right shape.

342
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,359
When I first saw the keywords,

343
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,764
I thought it'd be harder than I expected.

344
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,299
Mines are...

345
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:21,868
the Korean lucky sack, a cow, a cat,

346
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:23,936
a bell, and a heart with wings.

347
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,204
Yours are hard too.

348
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,373
They all look really difficult.

349
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:32,011
I think the cow is the hardest one.

350
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:33,279
(Worried)

351
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,365
I decided to try my best,

352
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,250
although it seemed difficult.

353
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,085
- Then, let's begin.
- Okay.

354
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,187
For the cat...

355
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,448
(STELLA tries the cat first.)

356
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:43,611
Out of five keywords,

357
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:46,926
I thought I could make the cat shape
the best.

358
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,512
Wait.

359
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,309
(Frozen after marking a dot)

360
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:54,567
It's way too hard.

361
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,903
All right. A cat...

362
00:13:57,514 --> 00:13:58,568
(Are those ears?)

363
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,964
(It appears to be a cat's face.)

364
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,576
(A cat made with her hard squeezing)

365
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,779
(Giggling)

366
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,615
(She adds the body
to make sure it looks like a cat.)

367
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,650
The cat is complete.

368
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,453
(She barely made it look like a cat
by making the body.)

369
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,555
- Is that a cat?
- It is.

370
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:17,757
(How is YE-ON doing, then?)

371
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,527
(Trembling)

372
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,395
(She's having trouble
squeezing the batter.)

373
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,245
Geez.

374
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,497
(The muscle workout didn't pay off.)

375
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,399
It's harder than I thought.

376
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,968
(Shaking severely)

377
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,037
(Has she become a motor drill?)

378
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,439
(What's the first cookie she made
with all her might?)

379
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,443
(Plump dog bone)

380
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,615
(STELLA now tries a bell.)

381
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,014
(Taking shape boldly)

382
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,150
Squeezing the batter out
was quite demanding,

383
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,019
so I tried my best
to put in all my strength.

384
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,923
And controlling the squeeze bag
was hard too,

385
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,993
so I tried to do it in one stroke.

386
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,398
(Following the bell,
she drew a cow fairly well.)

387
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:01,225
This cow is special,
as it has a very big nose.

388
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:03,807
(A big-nosed cow)

389
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,262
(Meanwhile, YE-ON...)

390
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:09,275
I got more focused...

391
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,010
after seeing STELLA do her best.

392
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,713
She kept me on my toes.

393
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,883
(What's with the size difference?)

394
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,516
(A baker specializes in X-large cookies
and another specializes in small ones)

395
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:20,599
(Turning her head)

396
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:23,753
(Giggling)

397
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:24,857
Those are cute.

398
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,293
What is this?

399
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,362
- It's a dog bone.
- What?

400
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,630
Does it look like one?

401
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,366
Well...

402
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,635
- Is this a bunny?
- Yes, it is.

403
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,437
- And this...
- A puppy.

404
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,944
(We're scanning her reaction.)

405
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:41,904
Okay. Good luck.

406
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:43,176
Good luck to you too.

407
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:47,711
YE-ON is usually really crafty...

408
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,981
with her hands,

409
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:53,085
but her cookies looked pretty odd today.

410
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,088
So, I'm confident about winning.

411
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,758
You did a great job.

412
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,993
The bell definitely looks like a bell.

413
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,061
Thank you.

414
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,232
I'll try my best to do better.

415
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:09,936
I saw STELLA's cookies,

416
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,404
and I thought...

417
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,475
mine still looked a bit better.

418
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:18,121
(A calm voice but not-so-calm hands)

419
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:21,117
(Rudolph's antlers are
giving her a nightmare.)

420
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,613
What does this look like?

421
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:25,384
What?

422
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:28,938
What's that? A lucky sack?

423
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:29,956
Yes.

424
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:32,959
No, this is not too bad.

425
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,829
We don't know how they'll look
after they're baked.

426
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:38,508
(Time for the last keyword)

427
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,565
What are you making now?

428
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:44,804
- I'm making a dragon.
- A dragon?

429
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,074
(A newborn dragon)

430
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,719
I don't know...

431
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,178
if I'm doing it right.

432
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:55,181
It almost looks like a seahorse.

433
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,804
It seems like...

434
00:16:57,105 --> 00:16:58,494
I'll win today.

435
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,619
Hey!

436
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:00,833
I'm confident!

437
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,856
I won't lose to you either!

438
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,556
(YE-ON's power on)

439
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:07,760
(Inhaling)

440
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:08,754
(Exhaling)

441
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,994
(Wrapping it up with a dragon breath)

442
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:13,366
I don't know what shape this is, but...

443
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:17,500
It was tough to make the dragon.

444
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,561
I followed my instincts
and focused on its general shape...

445
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:24,610
by adding wings and details.

446
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,547
(STELLA and YE-ON are done
piping the batter!)

447
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,849
It smelled wonderful,

448
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,385
and I felt confident about my cookies.

449
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,488
I am not sure about the dragon,

450
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,791
but I was quite confident about the rest.

451
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,395
(Done baking the cookies)

452
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,729
They...

453
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,364
already look...

454
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,105
(How do the cookies look?)

455
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:50,689
The cookies...

456
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:53,027
That doesn't seem right.

457
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:54,140
Oh, no!

458
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,306
(Speechless after seeing the cookies)

459
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:59,912
(Silenced by the cookies)

460
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,981
- That's a shock.
- I'm shocked too.

461
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,051
What do I do? Is this right?

462
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:07,771
(The camera is moving to shoot it.)

463
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,355
(Sorry, we failed to protect you.)

464
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,559
(How the cookies are supposed to look)

465
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,095
(Lifeless cookies)

466
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,264
They spread out too much.

467
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,700
The shapes are...

468
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,769
almost circles now.

469
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,671
You can't even tell...

470
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,241
what my cookies are
supposed to be shaped like.

471
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,376
Can the judge even evaluate these?

472
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,717
Let's see what the judge thinks.

473
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,415
(Preparing for the evaluation
with a heavy heart)

474
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,301
(Heading to the judge)

475
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,456
(A SMCHELIN judge)

476
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,213
I was so nervous.

477
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:48,661
I knew I was in trouble...

478
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,430
when I saw my cookies out of the oven.

479
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,099
I was nervous and embarrassed...

480
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,236
to think about the judge
evaluating these cookies.

481
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,572
I was nervous.

482
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,609
When I first saw my cookies
out of the oven,

483
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,846
I lost self-confidence a bit...

484
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,515
as they didn't turn out as expected.

485
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,486
(Time for the SMCHELIN judge's evaluation)

486
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,323
(The cookies are served
on the judging table.)

487
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,559
(Taking off the blindfold
to see the cookies for the first time)

488
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,794
(Blinking in confusion)

489
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,730
(Snickering)

490
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,831
(Snickering at the messy results)

491
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,500
Good work.

492
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,769
Thank you.

493
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,837
- Did YE-ON make these?
- Yes.

494
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,506
- And STELLA made these?
- Yes.

495
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,274
(Sighing)

496
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,543
I'll evaluate the cookies now.

497
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:39,278
- First, STELLA.
- Yes.

498
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:41,381
(Heart pounding)

499
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,170
(Guess what the cookies
took the shape of!)

500
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:45,318
(Cat, bell, cow, lucky sack,
and wing heart)

501
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,988
I made them...

502
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,489
way bigger than I wanted.

503
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,360
And they grew even bigger in the oven.

504
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,064
But if you look closely,

505
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:00,433
you'll see the details
I tried to highlight.

506
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:03,600
(Failing to hold her laugh in confusion)

507
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:05,561
This is...

508
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,124
(Stuck already on the first cookie)

509
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:10,976
Is this a mountain or a triangle?

510
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,478
And this...

511
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,503
(Snickering)

512
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:15,685
(Laughing)

513
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:18,007
(Try-not-to-laugh challenge)

514
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,862
(Another puzzling cookie)

515
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:21,387
A fat tiger!

516
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,594
(It's a miracle
that she thinks it's an animal.)

517
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,225
(Snickering)

518
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,716
(Laughing too much for serious evaluation)

519
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,680
Is this...

520
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:30,213
(The third cookie)

521
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:31,330
a cat?

522
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,497
(Feeling so bad for the judge)

523
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:36,693
(She guessed 0 cookies right
with 2 more to guess.)

524
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,003
Is this...

525
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,322
(Will she be right this time?)

526
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,406
a car?

527
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,697
(Pretty confident)

528
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,866
(She didn't drive over the heart.)

529
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:45,978
The last one looks...

530
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,584
(Please just get at least one right.)

531
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,455
(Working her brain to its fullest)

532
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,152
like an extra-large triangle.

533
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,665
(It's a lucky sack.)

534
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,858
(Murmuring in guilt)

535
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,943
(So sad)

536
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,229
- You got none right.
- None?

537
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,733
I thought she'd at least get one right,

538
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:09,969
but she didn't get any right.

539
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,470
It made me sad.

540
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,672
It'll be pretty shocking...

541
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,392
to lose to STELLA.

542
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:19,378
I want to win as I tried my best.

543
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:21,504
(Next, YE-ON's cookies)

544
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:23,283
(She only needs one point to win.)

545
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,951
(Dog bone, bunny, puppy,
Rudolph, and dragon)

546
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,622
I tried my best to shape them
as accurately as possible,

547
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,358
but the shapes changed dramatically...

548
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:34,166
in the oven.

549
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,699
(Judging the first cookie)

550
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,964
(Looking at it carefully)

551
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,404
(Laughing)

552
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:42,354
(Lips twitching)

553
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:44,093
(Laughter mode back on)

554
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,405
Is this a ribbon?

555
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,804
(Looking at her with confidence)

556
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,713
(The awkward smile means it's wrong.)

557
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:52,087
(What about the next cookie?)

558
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:53,279
Is this a heart?

559
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:55,314
(It's a lovely bunny.)

560
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,515
The third one...

561
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,590
(Hopeful this time)

562
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,902
(What's this with big ears?)

563
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:00,752
Is it a chick?

564
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,587
(It's a puppy.)

565
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,489
(Perplexed)

566
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,125
(Basically testing her creativity
at this point)

567
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,460
Is the fourth one a bunny?

568
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,595
(The big ears made her convinced
that it's a bunny.)

569
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,931
(Those aren't ears. They're antlers.)

570
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,367
(I admit that's confusing.)

571
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:15,935
The fifth one...

572
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,037
(The last chance to beat STELLA)

573
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:19,046
Is it a cloud?

574
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,503
(It's a dragon.)

575
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:23,075
(She got all of them wrong.)

576
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,910
- You didn't get any right.
- No?

577
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,760
No.

578
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:29,381
I didn't get any of their cookies right.

579
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,384
- This is a dog bone.
- I see.

580
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,086
It's a wing heart.

581
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,058
I see.

582
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,201
(An urgent rule change
as nobody won any points)

583
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:41,270
(The cookie that looks most similar
to the keyword wins.)

584
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,719
Now that you've told me what they are,

585
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:47,597
I can see how STELLA has added
a tail to the cat.

586
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,423
And looking at it again,

587
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:52,204
I can see how these are a puppy's ears.

588
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:55,645
(She has to choose one of these two.)

589
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:58,614
(Sorry for causing you a headache!)

590
00:22:59,115 --> 00:23:01,617
(Neck-to-neck battles are the hardest
to choose the winner in.)

591
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,460
(Who's the final winner?)

592
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,453
I'd say STELLA wins,

593
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,688
as her cat's tail looks more obvious.

594
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:11,490
Thank you!

595
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,270
(It was still a good fight.)

596
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,062
When shaping the cat,

597
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,033
I focused on its ears,

598
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,902
but she liked its tail instead.

599
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,037
I'm still thankful, though.

600
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:27,573
It's so pretty!

601
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,031
I know you wish you had it!

602
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,279
I baked cookies with YE-ON today.

603
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:37,216
I'm glad I got closer to YE-ON
through the process.

604
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,386
I want to share the prize with her.

605
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,382
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you.

606
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,391
(A heartwarming ending with them
sharing the prize)

607
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:49,948
We could get to know each other better.

608
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:53,262
We also got to watch
each other mess up with the cookies.

609
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:55,334
- It was so much fun.
- We had a blast.

610
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:00,169
(STELLA and YE-ON's Friendship Day
is over.)

611
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,907
(H2H's first camping trip)

612
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,612
(Must-haves for camping,)

613
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,214
(food!)

614
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,249
(Buy everything you want to eat!)

615
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:11,524
It looks delicious!

616
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,717
What?

617
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,704
(Tragedy awaits H2H?)

618
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,989
(All dinner ingredients have been locked.)

619
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,226
(They must succeed in three missions!)

620
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:24,864
(Burning passion for a delicious dinner)

621
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,466
- Let's eat everything.
- We can do it!

622
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,700
(But it's not easy.)

623
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:32,538
(How will H2H's first camping trip go?)

624
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,140
(Stay tuned for the next episode.)
