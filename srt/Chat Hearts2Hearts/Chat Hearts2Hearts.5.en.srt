1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,934
(What do you like to do on your day off?)

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,669
- Go camping!
- Go camping!

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:07,072
- That sounds fun!
- Let's go!

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,943
I'm so happy!

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,380
- My goodness. It'll be so much fun!
- I'm so excited!

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,382
Has everyone gone camping before?

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,017
- No!
- It's my first time.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,352
It's everyone's first time.

9
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,253
Let's head out!

10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,989
(Off to the campsite they go!)

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,124
I want to hear more
about your previous lives.

12
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,960
It was so cool.

13
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,362
My hand was up for 30 minutes,

14
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,067
- and I couldn't feel it.
- You can't feel anything.

15
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,265
Really?

16
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,068
- I didn't even realize it was up.
- Really?

17
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,037
- That's so cool.
- How fascinating.

18
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,240
A-NA is...

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,043
usually very cheerful, talkative,

20
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,844
and playful,

21
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,645
but seeing her so calm...

22
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:50,617
during her past life experience...

23
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,717
felt so new.

24
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,187
We baked...

25
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,454
- That's right.
- egg cookies.

26
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,723
- That must've been fun.
- The judge had to guess...

27
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,391
what shapes we made,

28
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,362
but our cookies looked so bad...

29
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,629
that she couldn't guess any.

30
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,432
(Looking for the cookies' lost identities)

31
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,035
It was a total flop.

32
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,670
It was pathetic.

33
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,873
Does everyone know
the "Perfect Pitch Game?"

34
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,342
- Yes.
- We played that...

35
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,110
and many other games.

36
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,979
Seoul...

37
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,750
(CARMEN mastered the game
after much struggling.)

38
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,252
(The walking team won 420 dollars
for allowance.)

39
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,588
The prize is worth 30 dollars.

40
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,391
(They deducted 30 dollars from the 420
for the key rings.)

41
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:35,261
(Now, they can use 390 dollars
at the next shoot.)

42
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,463
(The lucky duo happily accepted
the production crew's scam.)

43
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,366
We have 390 dollars in total.

44
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,735
- That's great!
- Amazing!

45
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,905
We carried the team!

46
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,707
- Great job!
- I know.

47
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,109
(YUHA is learning
about the allowance only now.)

48
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,612
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

49
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,181
(Suddenly practicing
the "Perfect Pitch Game?")

50
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,449
Can we get some extra allowance
if we succeed?

51
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,484
- Extra allowance?
- Yes.

52
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,753
Does anyone want to try it?

53
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:01,721
- Who wants to go?
- Me!

54
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,290
- I do!
- Who wants to try it?

55
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,490
- You can go first.
- Me?

56
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,959
Can we only choose one person?

57
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,695
No, all of you can go,

58
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,863
but why does everyone look...

59
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,499
(You're scaring us.)

60
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,736
- Let's all succeed.
- Yes.

61
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,704
- Let's win.
- Let's go.

62
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,338
Everyone will go.

63
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,606
(The "Perfect Pitch Game")

64
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,375
(They get 4 chances and win 10 dollars
per successful attempt.)

65
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,012
It's harder than you think, so go slowly.

66
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,880
- Bring it on!
- Let's go.

67
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,815
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

68
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,418
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

69
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,887
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

70
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,656
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

71
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,660
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

72
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,396
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

73
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,799
(Controlling the game with ease,
like a leader)

74
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,235
(Checking the crew's reaction)

75
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,568
She deserves ten dollars!

76
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,404
Ten dollars!

77
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,774
(Winning an extra ten dollars
for groceries)

78
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,075
A-NA can go first.

79
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,177
- You can do it, A-NA.
- Here I go.

80
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,679
I have to really focus.

81
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:01,814
- Good luck!
- I'm serious.

82
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,416
Let's go.

83
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,619
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

84
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,122
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

85
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,123
Seoul Forest... Sorry.

86
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,658
(A quick apology...)

87
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,160
(after "Seoul Forest")

88
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,796
(A big laugh instead of ten dollars)

89
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,031
Sorry.

90
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,700
Let's go, YUHA.

91
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,368
- You can do it!
- Let's go!

92
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,403
- Here I go.
- Let's go!

93
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,439
Let's go, YUHA!

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,006
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

95
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,642
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

96
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,844
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

97
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,380
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

98
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,649
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

99
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,585
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment!

100
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,221
(YUHA is H2H's best winning move.)

101
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,990
(It's a party on the bus.)

102
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,059
She forgot to say "Start" before her turn.

103
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,830
(The party abruptly ending)

104
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,132
(The sunny girl is getting cloudy.)

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,567
No, I must've said it.

106
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,468
- No, she didn't.
- Yes.

107
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,536
- Yes, she did.
- She did!

108
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,038
- I heard it.
- She said it!

109
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,572
I heard it through telepathy.

110
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,174
She said it. I mean it.

111
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,208
- I heard it.
- She said it.

112
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,211
(She forgot to say, "Start.")

113
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,046
(It doesn't count, then.)

114
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,981
Go again after saying, "Start."

115
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,416
Will you give me 20 dollars if I succeed?

116
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,484
(Double the money for double attempts.)

117
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,786
(Negotiating with a big smile)

118
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,388
(YUHA is the strongest winning move
at games.)

119
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,256
(Flustered crew)

120
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,858
- You can do it!
- Yes, you can!

121
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,360
- How about 15 dollars?
- For succeeding? Okay.

122
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,263
Okay, 15 dollars, then.

123
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,796
Let's start her off together.

124
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,332
In 1, 2, 3.

125
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,567
- Start!
- Start!

126
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,168
Let's go.

127
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,636
(We believe in you, our winner!)

128
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,405
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

129
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,474
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

130
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,710
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

131
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,178
Seoul Forest Steak...

132
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,246
Fail!

133
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,615
It's okay.

134
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,783
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

135
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,185
That's too bad.

136
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,087
YE-ON, you rehearsed it, so go.

137
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,187
- Go, YE-ON.
- YE-ON.

138
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,291
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

139
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,694
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment...

140
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,396
(So sad)

141
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,232
- Great job!
- You were amazing!

142
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,134
- It's so hard.
- It is.

143
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,470
Last one!

144
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,072
We'll go big and give 20 dollars.

145
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,174
Will you get 420 dollars...

146
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,977
or just 400?

147
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,377
Let's keep trying.

148
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,911
We'll keep getting more money.

149
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,181
- Who hasn't gone yet?
- Me.

150
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,815
Have you gone yet?

151
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,417
- Not yet.
- You can go.

152
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:19,819
I believe in you.

153
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,286
We're counting on IAN!

154
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,821
- Do well!
- You must win.

155
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,523
This is the real deal.

156
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,193
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

157
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,561
You stand a good chance.

158
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,463
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

159
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,165
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

160
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,035
That's not bad.

161
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:37,103
- I just have to breathe.
- Just focus.

162
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,870
Just focus and breathe.

163
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,239
- Wait.
- Breathe.

164
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,707
Let me take a breather.

165
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,975
Give me five seconds.

166
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,477
It's okay.

167
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,179
- Ready!
- She's ready.

168
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,480
(IAN's last attempt)

169
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,214
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

170
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,416
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

171
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,086
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

172
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,687
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

173
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,658
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

174
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,760
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment.

175
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,029
(One more turn before succeeding)

176
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:08,467
Seoul Forest Steak Apartment!

177
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:10,937
(IAN did it!)

178
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,272
(We won 20 dollars!)

179
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,374
Please tell me I did well.

180
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,176
You're the best!

181
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,245
- Great job!
- We won 20 dollars!

182
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,414
Let's play "Spot the Liar."

183
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,115
- Okay.
- That sounds fun.

184
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,784
(The answer is...)

185
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,618
("kimchi stew.")

186
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,654
Okay.

187
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,256
(Try to spot the liar.)

188
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,225
This is...

189
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,126
(Kimchi stew is...)

190
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,896
one of Korea's signature foods.

191
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,233
Don't make it so obvious, okay?

192
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,634
- I get it.
- You get it, right?

193
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,103
(They must keep the liar clueless.)

194
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,373
My dad is great...

195
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,140
at cooking this.

196
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,908
(Getting self-conscious)

197
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,677
(Why is she nodding?)

198
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,978
My mom...

199
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,781
isn't good at making it.

200
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,183
(Bringing her mom in...)

201
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,685
(after YUHA brought her dad in)

202
00:06:58,686 --> 00:06:59,985
This is...

203
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,220
intense.

204
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,020
(Impressed)

205
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,224
This is edible.

206
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,926
(Looking around)

207
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,194
(That's a given.)

208
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,294
Something is fishy.

209
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,630
- Something is fishy about CARMEN.
- My gosh.

210
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,232
(Is CARMEN the liar?)

211
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,400
This is...

212
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,335
my favorite food.

213
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,404
That doesn't sound right.

214
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,040
Something is off.

215
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,075
- My gosh!
- What a liar!

216
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,411
- You seem suspicious.
- You do!

217
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,812
- Something smells fishy.
- It does!

218
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,749
I like something similar to this food.

219
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,487
This is perfect
with a rolled egg omelet and rice.

220
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,488
- That's true.
- I totally agree.

221
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,989
- Should we do another turn?
- Yes.

222
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,191
Why don't we have one more turn?

223
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,359
That sounds good.

224
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,395
- And choose the liar after?
- Yes.

225
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,195
Yes.

226
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,331
I need ham...

227
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,033
in this dish.

228
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,133
It's warm.

229
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,136
(Everyone is getting specific.)

230
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,104
That's a big hint.

231
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,273
This is...

232
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,276
a historical dish.

233
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,111
It was created long ago.

234
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,647
(I see.)

235
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,883
(Kimchi stew...)

236
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,851
It needs meat in it.

237
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,688
It is and can be spicy.

238
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,956
It can be spicy?

239
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,491
(It can be spicy for CARMEN, right?)

240
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,093
(Getting suspicious)

241
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,796
You get thirsty after eating it.

242
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,100
- JUUN sounds so suspicious.
- She does!

243
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,035
It's JUUN.

244
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,404
(Getting self-conscious)

245
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,305
Go.

246
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,774
This dish is...

247
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,476
all about who makes it.

248
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,211
It's red.

249
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,817
(Who's the liar?)

250
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,685
I think it's JUUN.

251
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,087
- Me too.
- It must be JUUN!

252
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,256
- It's JUUN.
- I'm sure.

253
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,358
Why do you think it's me?

254
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,426
It's JUUN.

255
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,396
You sound like you're guessing the dish
based on our clues.

256
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,064
- That's right.
- It's JUUN.

257
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,801
(Nobody could relate
to JUUN's descriptions.)

258
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,670
(Is JUUN really the liar?)

259
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,405
- In 1, 2, 3!
- In 1, 2, 3!

260
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,441
(Everyone is voting for JUUN
without hesitation.)

261
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,409
You!

262
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,644
(You're the liar!)

263
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,978
Everyone is going to regret this.

264
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,680
JUUN...

265
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,616
is...

266
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,752
(She's the liar, right?)

267
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,521
(JUUN is...)

268
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,689
not the liar.

269
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,860
(She's not the liar?)

270
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,129
(Their first guess was wrong.)

271
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,031
I told you I wasn't the liar!

272
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,399
I described it so well!

273
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,168
(The mystery enthusiast is
frozen in shock.)

274
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,703
I described it so well.

275
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,473
Who is it, then?

276
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,075
Hold on.

277
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,576
Hold on.

278
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,379
- CARMEN!
- No, it's not me!

279
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,780
YE-ON, what did you say?

280
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,015
I don't think she's the liar.

281
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,216
JIWOO, what did you say?

282
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,553
(Who is it?)

283
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,388
What did you say?

284
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,058
My dad is good at cooking it,

285
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,425
and it needs ham.

286
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,696
It's her!

287
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,297
It's definitely her!

288
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,698
It's her!

289
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,800
Why would it be me?

290
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,502
- It's definitely her.
- How?

291
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,772
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- Explain why.

292
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,272
Can I explain it?

293
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,708
Yes, but without hinting
at what the keyword is.

294
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,612
YUHA's dad is good
at making a similar dish,

295
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,048
but it's not this.

296
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,517
- I know it!
- You know it, right?

297
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,752
- I know it!
- That's right.

298
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,154
Is it YUHA, then?

299
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,856
It could be YUHA.

300
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,124
(YUHA is now a strong candidate.)

301
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,726
I don't know. I'm not the liar.

302
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,062
- You've been exposed!
- No! Wait.

303
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,898
We lose if you guess it correctly...

304
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,165
after this round.

305
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,502
Trust me. I'm smart.

306
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,071
(Acting mysterious)

307
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,639
You dummies!

308
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,741
You dummies!

309
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,977
- It's her!
- It's YUHA!

310
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,079
(Getting more suspicion
with her odd reaction)

311
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,047
You seem suspicious.

312
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,715
It's YUHA.

313
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:51,817
Let's choose her.

314
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,085
Gosh!

315
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,920
In 1, 2, 3.

316
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:56,822
(Everyone has chosen YUHA as the liar.)

317
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,890
YUHA...

318
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,125
is...

319
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,660
The liar, right?

320
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,296
- She's a liar!
- Please!

321
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,564
(Is A-NA's guess right?)

322
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,165
- Please!
- not the liar!

323
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,300
(No, she's not it.)

324
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:10,903
Really?

325
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,872
(Come on, A-NA!)

326
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,540
- This is...
- You're so bad!

327
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,109
But I...

328
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,411
I told you she wasn't the liar.

329
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,579
Why isn't she the liar?

330
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,083
(A-NA accused two innocent girls.)

331
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,951
I told you!

332
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,253
We're doomed!

333
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,688
It's over!

334
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,157
(Shaking her head)

335
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,459
They're dummies.

336
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,828
Who's the liar?

337
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,830
Who is it? She's doing so well!

338
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,799
The liar is so good.

339
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,637
(The hidden liar is...)

340
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,938
(IAN.)

341
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,939
(Grinning)

342
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,408
(She had no clue in Round One.)

343
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,977
I see.

344
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,580
(She said something similar to YUHA.)

345
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,617
(Thanks to the innocent bad gamer,)

346
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,452
(she could blame someone else.)

347
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,154
(Collecting clues)

348
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,858
(Clue: A well-known Korean dish
made with ham)

349
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,827
(Her wit helped her survive
the second round.)

350
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,397
(She also took advantage
of the clueless detective, A-NA.)

351
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,100
(Keep it up, YUHA.)

352
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,670
(That's what got IAN
off the suspect list.)

353
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,272
Who is it, then?

354
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,373
Who's the liar?

355
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,775
Doesn't that mean the liar figured it out?

356
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,445
You're right. I'm not the liar, right?

357
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,048
I need to see it again too.

358
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,450
(She may not be a good detective,
but she's definitely a good entertainer.)

359
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,586
You have only one chance left.

360
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,989
How about one last round
before we call it?

361
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,158
Good idea.

362
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,394
Everyone has
their own favorite toppings for this.

363
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,430
(She's right, indeed.)

364
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,263
YE-ON.

365
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,599
It's Korean food.

366
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,568
(It's definitely Korean food.)

367
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,937
- Can I be bold this time?
- Yes.

368
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,740
I love eating this...

369
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,276
with some ramyeon.

370
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,177
(Kimchi stew tastes better with ramyeon.)

371
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,047
(She's right about it.)

372
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,950
I like eating it with some rice added.

373
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,084
This is hard for me to eat.

374
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,386
It really is.

375
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,589
- Is it hard for CARMEN?
- Really?

376
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,957
- What?
- You, CARMEN?

377
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,127
(The bad detective is at it again.)

378
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,662
I'm sure the liar is CARMEN.

379
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,000
You said you liked it.

380
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,534
You told me that it was really good.

381
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,603
It is good, but I hard for me to eat.

382
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,606
(The innocent sunny girl is cornered
for no reason.)

383
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,107
- I know it's not true!
- It's CARMEN.

384
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,375
Why is it hard for you?

385
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,412
(The fool is cornering another fool.)

386
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,315
I'm 100 percent sure it's CARMEN.

387
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,384
It is really hard... It's not me!

388
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,187
CARMEN really can't handle it.

389
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,721
She's right. I can't!

390
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,889
- YE-ON!
- She really can't.

391
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,424
I know why.

392
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:46,992
I really can't.

393
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:51,039
- It must be another food.
- I'm confused.

394
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,165
The last one is STELLA.

395
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,566
(Now, STELLA is the last one left.)

396
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,702
I said I really wanted
to eat this last week.

397
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,638
- Did anyone hear her?
- Did anyone hear her?

398
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,672
(Raise your hand if you heard her.)

399
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,441
I've never heard you say it.

400
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,544
- Has anyone heard her?
- I didn't.

401
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,211
I'm sure someone heard me.

402
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,346
Back me up, please.

403
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,850
What did you say again?

404
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,016
Did you say it to me?

405
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,118
- I think I did.
- Really?

406
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:15,163
Are you sure it was me?

407
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,188
Hold on.

408
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,723
(She told someone, but no one remembers.)

409
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,157
I'll take it back.

410
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,127
(Is it a "Liar Game" or a "Fool Game?")

411
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,496
Maybe it's STELLA.

412
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,621
It's not me.

413
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,734
I'm not sure who to suspect.

414
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,370
- Let's vote out CARMEN.
- STELLA is suspicious too.

415
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,606
She mentioned wanting to eat...

416
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,307
something similar to this.

417
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:40,813
(This whole mystery-solving style
of hers feels familiar.)

418
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,914
Or maybe not. I'm not sure.

419
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,116
Come on. Be confident.
Don't lose confidence.

420
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,585
- Okay.
- I think it's IAN.

421
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,519
Me? Why?

422
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,122
I've been suspecting IAN from the start.

423
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,266
(Ever since IAN spoke in Round One,)

424
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,192
(she's been suspecting her.)

425
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:57,229
(She kept a close eye on IAN
during Round Two.)

426
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,431
(Something is off about her.)

427
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,800
(Keeping a close eye on her)

428
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,268
Why do I think it's IAN?

429
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,337
- I know. I think it's IAN too.
- Maybe not.

430
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,406
It's IAN.

431
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,475
IAN said her mom wasn't good at making it,

432
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,843
and that it was a historical dish.

433
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,112
She's right. IAN's acting suspiciously.

434
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,781
- She's right.
- Right.

435
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,716
(Stumped)

436
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,253
- But it is a historical food!
- That's true, but...

437
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,956
It's one of the most iconic Korean dishes.

438
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,992
(Staring)

439
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,028
You know that I'm not good at lying.

440
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,231
(Fidgeting)

441
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,199
I really don't think it's IAN.

442
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,369
(She's proving to be the worst detective.)

443
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,805
I'm not sure.

444
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,108
What if we have two liars?

445
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,145
- Are there two?
- Are they two? We have one more?

446
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,479
There's one.

447
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:52,150
(She's just a good liar.)

448
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,552
Let's take a poll
and see what everyone thinks.

449
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,688
- Right. Let's do it.
- In 2, 3.

450
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,223
(Four of them think it's IAN.)

451
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,391
- Why me?
- It's IAN, then.

452
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,793
We think it's IAN. Is IAN the liar?

453
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,696
IAN is...

454
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,031
a liar.

455
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,335
(We got you, liar!)

456
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,507
See? My intuition was spot on!

457
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,040
I'm a good detective.

458
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,577
If the liar gets the answer right,

459
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,379
they win the game.

460
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,115
I'm not sure I'm right,
but I think it's kimchi stew.

461
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,852
(Oh, we're doomed.)

462
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,955
She figured it out already.

463
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,623
I win!

464
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,227
(How did you even win this game?)

465
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:36,328
- I really can't eat kimchi stew!
- That's crazy.

466
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:37,963
Is it for real?

467
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,698
I was a good player, right?

468
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,466
Yes, you really were.

469
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,268
And I won the game in the end.

470
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,737
I kept defending you!

471
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:46,871
I only suspected these three!

472
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,909
- I know! What on earth were you thinking?
- You were the villain.

473
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,644
It's all because of A-NA!

474
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:55,781
- She was really helpful.
- I'm very sorry.

475
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,749
That was hilarious.

476
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,017
I'm sorry.

477
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,088
What do you think is
the highlight of camping?

478
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,324
- Barbeque?
- A barbeque party?

479
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:09,394
(It's time to go grocery shopping!)

480
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,631
- We earned it!
- We did it so well.

481
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,367
You have 10 minutes to grab
what you need from the supermarket.

482
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,501
That sounds fun!

483
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,904
(That sounds so busy!)

484
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,240
Hold on. We only have ten minutes?

485
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,676
- Let's divide up the work.
- Let's split up the work.

486
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,978
The older members should be
in charge of the meat.

487
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,880
- Yes. Because they know better.
- Yes, JIWOO and...

488
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,150
Let's split into Team Older
and Team Younger.

489
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,085
We'll get the main ingredients...

490
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,454
while Team Younger picks up
some fruit and side items.

491
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,146
- Like pickled radish and lettuce.
- Pickled radish.

492
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,491
Let's get as much done as we can
in the limited time.

493
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,461
- Let's go.
- Let's start.

494
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,930
- Ten minutes!
- Only ten minutes!

495
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,764
- Only ten minutes!
- Get the cart!

496
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,133
It's started already!

497
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:49,867
Move!

498
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,470
- Let's go!
- Go!

499
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,672
(Let's do just as we planned.)

500
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,074
Meat!

501
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,409
Meat!

502
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,679
Let's go find everything we need. Quick!

503
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,847
(Team Older and Team Younger split up
just as they planned.)

504
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,215
No, let's get the bigger one.

505
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,883
I think it's this way.

506
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,519
(Time remaining)

507
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,822
- Hey!
- Let's grab anything.

508
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:10,789
They have strawberries there. Hold on.

509
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,791
Let's get this one too.

510
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,226
(Theyr puts the whole box
of fruits on the cart.)

511
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,927
Let's get going!

512
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,097
- There are strawberries.
- Where are strawberries?

513
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,532
Golden needle mushroom!

514
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,600
Get them anyway.

515
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,001
Grab four or five of them.

516
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,504
- They look so fresh.
- Don't we need watermelons?

517
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,438
Watermelons. That's too much.

518
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,373
Is that too much?

519
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,508
- Hold on.
- Don't we need some mango?

520
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,477
- Wait.
- Shall we get some mango?

521
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,145
Mago? Mango sounds good.

522
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:35,781
Lettuce.

523
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,685
(While the other Team Younger members were
scrambling, she got the job done.)

524
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,388
(YE-ON is on the hunt
for her next target, greens for wraps.)

525
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,823
Is it enough?

526
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,125
The selection seems to have
some greens nobody wants.

527
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,326
I got some golden needle mushrooms.

528
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,061
- Don't you like king trumpet mushroom?
- Don't you?

529
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,596
Shall we get some?

530
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,132
- Why don't we get this assorted one?
- Hold on.

531
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,934
Let's just buy one king trumpet mushroom.

532
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,669
- All right.
- Do you even like these?

533
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,737
- Do you?
- I don't, but... We don't like it.

534
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,273
(But someone must want it, right?)

535
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,574
Do you want them?

536
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,343
- They don't.
- They don't want them.

537
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,879
Hold on. We don't have time
to browse the store.

538
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,414
Wait.

539
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,882
- What do we need now?
- Hold on.

540
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,385
Our plan was all set.

541
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,818
We need some salt and sesame oil.

542
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,421
Oh, right. Salt and sesame oil.

543
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:18,833
Where are salt and sesame oil?

544
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,758
- Let's go find them.
- Sesame oil.

545
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,194
Where is a butchery? There it is.

546
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,594
(Advancing straight)

547
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,397
- There it is. Let's buy the meat first.
- Meat.

548
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,569
- And then...
- Hello.

549
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:33,171
We asked him to give us
a mix of pork and beef.

550
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,641
- Blade steak. It's good.
- Blade steak.

551
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,176
- How about strip loin?
- Strip loin.

552
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,644
It looks delicious.

553
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,179
Are we eating some duck meat too?

554
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Duck!

555
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,182
(Team Older sticks
to just the essentials.)

556
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,216
Korean beef.

557
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,418
This looks delicious.

558
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,854
Isn't there something you want to eat?

559
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,123
No. I only want some meat.

560
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,091
- Only meat?
- Is Team Younger doing okay?

561
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,561
Are they doing all right?

562
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,265
I don't know anything
about sesame oil. Help me.

563
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,501
- Help me!
- Can't you get sesame oil?

564
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,737
- I think I know this brand.
- Right.

565
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:06,905
Don't we need this?

566
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,273
- Five minutes?
- We only have five minutes left?

567
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,742
- No way!
- We need salt!

568
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,078
Do we have to complete the purchase?

569
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,813
I think we're supposed
to put everything in the cart.

570
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:15,981
Are we okay, yet?

571
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,381
We need to complete the purchase!

572
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,750
- We won't make it at this rate!
- Even the purchase?

573
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,985
Can we get one squid snack?

574
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,586
- Stop kidding.
- What about a fish cake bar?

575
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,055
Hey, did you see rice?

576
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,456
We have it here.

577
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,459
- Checkout counter.
- We got it.

578
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,494
- We got everything, right?
- We did.

579
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,964
I'm coming, girls!

580
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,399
Let's go.

581
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,467
- Did you get enough meat?
- Yes.

582
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,835
- We got plenty of it.
- Hello.

583
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,804
Here we go.

584
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,772
- We're almost...
- Is time almost up?

585
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,873
Yes.

586
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,776
We have a minute
to put everything in the bags.

587
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,578
(Time is up.)

588
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,979
(Both Teams spent
about 400 dollars in total.)

589
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,215
(They completed the purchase
within budget.)

590
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,383
It's so cool doing stuff
I've only seen on TV.

591
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,351
- Right.
- Yes.

592
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,844
Don't tell me we have
to win a game to eat dinner.

593
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,689
What if we lose every round?

594
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,624
I should've picked up more food,
just in case!

595
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,494
I can't let them take our groceries away.

596
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,363
(They arrive at the campsite,
worried about the food.)

597
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,265
- It's so beautiful here!
- Oh, gosh.

598
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,233
It's beautiful!

599
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,805
- Amazing!
- I love it.

600
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:12,809
No way!

601
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:14,939
(They're entering the campsite
with their hand full of food.)

602
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,374
It's so pretty.

603
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,976
(A campfire to keep you warm,
and string lights to set the mood)

604
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,077
Unbelievable.

605
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,178
It's so pretty.

606
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,148
Amazing. I love it so much.

607
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,249
(This is the cozy campsite for tonight.)

608
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,151
It's so beautiful.

609
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,319
- I love it.
- This is crazy.

610
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,553
It smells like camping out here.

611
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,154
We have a campfire.

612
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,657
(The smell of the fire completes
the camping vibe.)

613
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,792
(Wowing)

614
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,628
This is so nice.

615
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,864
Look at the crescent moon.

616
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,031
- That's beautiful.
- The moon is so pretty.

617
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,699
It's like I'm dreaming.

618
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,100
She's right, seriously.

619
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,369
(Romance in the air,)

620
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,804
(a cozy fire crackling,)

621
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,372
(and even the grocery run felt
like a first-time adventure.)

622
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,108
I'm so happy.

623
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:53,244
(Everything is perfect
as long as they get to eat.)

624
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,815
(But someone has come to steal their joy!)

625
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,451
(What is going on?)

626
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,120
(Is this for real?)

627
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,187
What's that?

628
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,323
(Anything you say can become
a reality on TV.)

629
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,858
- They're really taking everything.
- No way.

630
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,195
(Sad)

631
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,996
There's something...

632
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,466
- No!
- No!

633
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,633
No.

634
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,734
Don't tell me it's real.

635
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,102
That's our meat!

636
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,605
(Getting anxious)

637
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,507
Are you locking it up?

638
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,542
- With a padlock?
- No way!

639
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,311
- With those chains?
- Unbelievable.

640
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,213
I can't do this.

641
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,015
- Variety shows are no joke.
- It's scary.

642
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,317
- They're not messing around.
- Tell me it's a joke.

643
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,554
- No!
- No!

644
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:37,488
- No.
- I can't believe it.

645
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,725
(How can they get their food back?)

646
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,621
(Complete team missions
to earn the food back.)

647
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:44,795
(Mission One: Coming up soon)

648
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,431
(Mission Two: Coming up soon)

649
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:50,269
(Mission Three: Coming up soon)

650
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,404
(Succeed in each mission,
and you'll get one dish back.)

651
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,363
(Fail, and it's off the table.)

652
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,573
It depends on the mission.

653
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,608
I can't predict anything.

654
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:58,944
Let's go.

655
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,979
Let's win them all
so we can eat everything!

656
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,914
- Let's eat all!
- Let's do that!

657
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,450
- In 1, 2, 3!
- In 1, 2, 3!

658
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,917
- We got this!
- We got this!

659
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,422
Here is the first mission of Round One.

660
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,723
- You can do this!
- Right on!

661
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,358
- We got this.
- Yes.

662
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,893
Before we start,

663
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,962
JIWOO...

664
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,033
has to come with us alone.

665
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,368
(Only me?)

666
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,104
- Am I doing something alone?
- Yes.

667
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,772
(Getting even more nervous)

668
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,641
You get how these games work, right?

669
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:33,011
It might be about guessing personal stuff.

670
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,647
(That sounds plausible.)

671
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:36,514
About us, the members.

672
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,251
- Just go with your gut.
- Right.

673
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,252
And if you have to choose
between right or left,

674
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,187
pick right.

675
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,822
If I have to choose right or left,
just choose right?

676
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,224
Then, I'll go with the above
if the options are above or below.

677
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,592
That sounds nice.

678
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,661
- You can do it.
- Just show them!

679
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:52,398
- Let's go!
- You can do it!

680
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,933
- See you soon!
- Bye!

681
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,001
(They're saying goodbye
like the last time.)

682
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:57,902
Bye.

683
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,538
The Round One is...
