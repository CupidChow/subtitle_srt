1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:02,233
(Time to find out
what's on each member's mind)

2
00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:03,333
It sounds fun.

3
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:07,733
"You're now living in a two-story house
with your friends."

4
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:10,766
"The blue room is your room."

5
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:14,733
"Then, who'd be living in each room?"

6
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:17,966
"Room C is a small room like a pantry."

7
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:19,233
"Three rooms are shared
by two people each,"

8
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,533
"and one is a single room."

9
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,666
Then, is Room C the single room?

10
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,366
- It's up to you.
- Your choice.

11
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:25,200
Okay.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,100
- So, the housemates are our members?
- Yes.

13
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,666
I love the single room.

14
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,133
But it's small.

15
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,300
It feels like it's going to come true.

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,600
Right.

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,566
Knowing it's a psych test makes me
not want to answer it.

18
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,800
(The mystery enthusiast doesn't want
her mind to be read.)

19
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,433
(Still, she's focused.)

20
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:42,866
Okay.

21
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,233
- I'm done.
- Me too.

22
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,733
- Are you all done?
- Yes.

23
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,066
(All done! Let's go chase their minds!)

24
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:51,633
This is my room.

25
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:54,100
And the next room is A-NA's single room.

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,322
(You know how much I care about you!)

27
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,633
Oh, my.

28
00:00:57,966 --> 00:00:58,833
That's understandable.

29
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,733
- Of course.
- What's the reason?

30
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:05,666
A-NA and I will have
some private time upstairs.

31
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:11,233
(YUHA never forgets
to make a romantic moment.)

32
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,100
Awesome.

33
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,100
(There she goes again.)

34
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,900
Okay.

35
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,700
The international club members can
share Room B.

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,600
IAN and YE-ON are sharing Room C,

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,800
while JIWOO and JUUN are sharing Room D.

38
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,700
The room next to my room is...

39
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,500
for YUHA and STELLA.

40
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,633
I tried my best to have members
of the same age share rooms.

41
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:34,766
That's a good idea.

42
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:37,133
So, I assigned YUHA and STELLA to Room A.

43
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,300
IAN and JUUN are sharing Room B.

44
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,866
- I think they'll be quite loud.
- That's better.

45
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,400
YE-ON is using Room C alone.

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
And the two oldest members
of the same age are in Room D.

47
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,233
- YE-ON's turn.
- YE-ON.

48
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,633
This blue one is my room.

49
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:52,833
A-NA and YUHA are staying
in the room next to mine.

50
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:53,866
Great.

51
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:56,566
Since A-NA is...

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,500
my favorite,

53
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:03,433
(Sudden and yet confession)

54
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,900
so I put her in that room.

55
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,666
(Nervous)

56
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,566
(K-dramas are fun, indeed.)

57
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:10,900
She's sharing it with YUHA...

58
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,166
because you like her, right?

59
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,333
That's why I put the two in one room.

60
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,433
Room C is IAN's own room.

61
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:21,908
CARMEN and STELLA are sharing Room D.

62
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,966
I assigned JUUN and JIWOO Room B.

63
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,366
I paired the two because they're known
as the WOOJU duo to our fans.

64
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,200
That's why I paired them.

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
(The pair choreography duo, WOOJU duo)

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
I assigned JIWOO and JUUN Room B.

67
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,033
They both are good dancers,

68
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,333
so they can practice dancing there.

69
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,264
(IAN's House)

70
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,776
(Extroverts on the second floor,
and the rest on the first floor)

71
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,566
And JIWOO and JUUN are sharing Room B.

72
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,900
They both are good at dancing.

73
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,733
You guys want us to practice dancing
even back in the house!

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,666
But in the farthest room
to minimize the noise.

75
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,300
- You know the "come and getcha" part.
<i>- Come and getcha.</i>

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,333
YE-ON will use Room C alone.

77
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,133
She wished she had her own room.

78
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,433
- What's that?
- Oh, my.

79
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,055
(YE-ON doesn't deny it, though.)

80
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,533
- Are you okay?
- Everyone has the same wish.

81
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,266
- That's true.
- Yes.

82
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,700
(CARMEN's House)

83
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,996
(Unexpected soulmates in Room A,
the choreo duo in Room B)

84
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,766
The oldest ones should have the right
to choose their rooms first.

85
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,400
- That's what I believe.
- I agree.

86
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,500
Because they're older ones,
I put them upstairs.

87
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,766
IAN and YE-ON are on the first floor,

88
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:29,166
where they can watch outside easily.

89
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,733
I made Room E, a party room
where we can all have fun.

90
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,433
(She built a special party room!)

91
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,166
- Isn't it great?
- I knew it.

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,200
(Just the thought of it makes me excited.)

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,100
- As expected.
- What a great choice.

94
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,233
You're so creative.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,626
- Isn't it a good choice?
- You're very creative.

96
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,928
That's all good now.

97
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:53,300
It's time to find out
what this test says about your psychology.

98
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,933
- We've never done this before.
- Right.

99
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,733
Check who you assigned to Room A.

100
00:03:58,733 --> 00:03:59,766
- Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,966
(Everyone assigned
their cherished ones to Room A.)

102
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,646
They're the ones you rely on the most.

103
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,066
"The ones you put in Room A..."

104
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:12,566
"are very precious people
you always want by your side."

105
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,933
"Because you're close to them,"

106
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,233
"you often get mischievous to them."

107
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,825
"But when you're in trouble,
you can rely on them."

108
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:19,926
I think it's right.

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,294
YUHA and STELLA.

110
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:22,976
- It's correct.
- I agree.

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,366
"Those in Room B..."

112
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,533
I assigned JUUN and JIWOO Room B.

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,100
(Lots of them assigned JIWOO and JUUN,
the Come-and-Getcha duo, to Room B.)

114
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,233
"Those in Room B are the ones I respect."

115
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,433
I actually find
JIWOO and JUUN's dance skills...

116
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,066
and passion so admiring.

117
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,866
- I do respect the two.
- Me too.

118
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,700
(Pleased by the nonstop praise)

119
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,988
I think it's correct!

120
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
I also put JIWOO and JUUN.

121
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,200
I assigned it to JUUN and IAN.

122
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,233
But IAN?

123
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,266
(Laughing)

124
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,500
Sorry, girls. I don't think it's correct.

125
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,366
Who did you assign the room to?

126
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,533
These two.

127
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,900
Maybe you respect us.

128
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,133
"Those in Room B have
a lot of strengths I don't..."

129
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,033
"and I can learn so much from them,"

130
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,533
"but they are also
very different from me,"

131
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,800
"so it can feel a little awkward
around them sometimes."

132
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,900
I think that's right.

133
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,100
I really respect your sense of humor.

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
- Thank you very much.
- I appreciate it.

135
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,066
The entertaining duo.

136
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,433
You have what I lack.

137
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,233
The next is Room C.

138
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,966
(Since the room is small,
it's mostly used as a single room.)

139
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:38,300
(IAN and YE-ON were assigned to the room
the most often.)

140
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:42,500
Those in Room C are the ones
who'll be with you forever.

141
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,466
Hey!

142
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,733
IAN!

143
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:47,566
Hey.

144
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,866
(Let's stay together forever,
the ones in the single room!)

145
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:51,900
IAN!

146
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,533
YE-ON!

147
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,133
It's time to check out Room D.

148
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,333
I'll get right to it.

149
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,133
(They saw the results and cracked up.)

150
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,466
(What does Room D mean?)

151
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,333
Why?

152
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,766
You put those you look down on in Room D.

153
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:10,733
(I didn't mean it.)

154
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,033
(Oh, no!)

155
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,566
"Having them live in the room
right under yours implies..."

156
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:18,100
"that you think
you're superior in many ways."

157
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,300
No way!

158
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,082
- I assigned JIWOO and JUUN to it.
- Me too.

159
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,700
It's okay. I also assigned the room
to you guys.

160
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,054
- Girls, I'm sorry.
- So, we don't look down on each other.

161
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,400
(Feeling bad, though unintentional)

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,266
I'm sorry, CARMEN and YE-ON.

163
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,833
That means you're comfortable around them.

164
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,133
- Right.
- That's right.

165
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,033
- It was so fun.
- It's just for fun, you know.

166
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,033
- She's right.
- Right.

167
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,733
- I had so much fun.
- Me too.

168
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,000
Is there more?

169
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,566
We prepared one more thing.

170
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:47,866
(Is there more?)

171
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,866
Someone wrote letters to us.

172
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:51,766
Amazing!

173
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,500
(Surprised)

174
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,700
We received two letters.

175
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
And the one who wrote this,

176
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,233
please come out.

177
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:03,200
(Which one of us wrote the letter?)

178
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:04,400
Who is it?

179
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,700
Who wrote that?

180
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,400
It's me.

181
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,000
No way!

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,800
(The first secret letter is from JIWOO.)

183
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:18,100
(The cool-headed JIWOO wrote it?)

184
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,233
If you wrote it seriously, I might cry.

185
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,600
- Did you write it seriously?
- Should we all write one?

186
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,600
Gosh!

187
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,533
(Time to read the letter she wrote)

188
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,866
- JIWOO!
- JIWOO!

189
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,666
- JIWOO!
- What's going on?

190
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,966
(Making dolphin-like sounds, embarrassed)

191
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,833
Are you crying already?

192
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,066
- Don't cry!
- Come on!

193
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,333
JIWOO, read it for us.

194
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,933
I'm not crying.

195
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,466
- It comes as pain to me.
- All right.

196
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:44,266
- I'm sorry.
- I thought you were crying.

197
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,566
Read it now.

198
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,466
"Hello, girls."

199
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

200
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
- Hello.
- Keep it up.

201
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,833
You can do it.

202
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,200
"I'm JIWOO."

203
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,733
"I feel so shy to read out
the letter I wrote,"

204
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:56,800
"but I'll do my best."

205
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,466
"Our first promotion ended very smoothly,"

206
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,366
"all thanks to you guys."

207
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,133
- It's so moving.
- I know.

208
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,466
(They're welling up already.)

209
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,824
"We finally performed 'The Chase'
we've been practicing so hard..."

210
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,633
"day and night before our debut."

211
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,733
"Watching eight of us on TV
brought me mixed feelings."

212
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,000
Give me a second.

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,533
(She's not crying.)

214
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,400
Gosh.

215
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,533
"It must've not been easy
because I was so detail-oriented."

216
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,433
"Still, thank you for following my lead."

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,666
"Our trainee periods, ages,
and hometowns are different,"

218
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,666
"but I think we, all eight of us,
are really lucky to be together."

219
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:34,366
(Welled up)

220
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:35,966
(Bursting into tears)

221
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,800
- Is she crying?
- She is.

222
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,333
Be cautious, girls!

223
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,400
I'll never cry.

224
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:44,800
"Every one of us is irreplaceable,"

225
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,166
"and I think everyone is
doing their part really well."

226
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,800
"CARMEN, the happy girl of the team,"

227
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,500
"thank you for staying
the sun of the group."

228
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,100
"We could cheer up
when we were tired, thanks to you."

229
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,733
"And YUHA, who's like a real family,"

230
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,600
"I still remember us saying
we should debut as a group..."

231
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,233
(Welled up)

232
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:08,466
"in the training room
when we were younger."

233
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,500
It's driving me crazy.

234
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,200
It's really driving me crazy.
I can't watch this.

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,266
Oh, my.

236
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,266
I'll never cry.

237
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,900
(But her eyes are teary already.)

238
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,733
"I wouldn't have made it
through my trainee days without you."

239
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,427
"Let's cheer each other on
in the future too."

240
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,333
(Trying to hold back tears)

241
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:24,800
"Cutie STELLA."

242
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,266
"You're such a charming girl."

243
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,833
"Just watching you makes me happy."

244
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,466
"You're doing just fine,
so have confidence in yourself."

245
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,866
"And A-NA,"

246
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,833
"the brightest puppy of Hearts2Hearts."

247
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,933
"Thank you for being kind
and taking care of the members."

248
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,400
"And you're really funny and cute."

249
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,933
"You're doing good enough
with confidence,"

250
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:47,900
"so..."

251
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,933
(Bursting into tears finally)

252
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,392
She's trying to hold back tears!

253
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,300
(Who said she'd never cry?)

254
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,200
"Keep the confidence in yourself
and cheer up."

255
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,532
(JIWOO's kind words brought her to tears.)

256
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,533
I wasn't ready for this.

257
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,400
Seriously.

258
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,966
- This is insane.
- It's for your stronger mentality.

259
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:07,800
Right.

260
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,766
"And JUUN, the dancing queen."

261
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,133
"Your cuteness often melts my heart."

262
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:17,066
"When you really go all out dancing,
it's really dangerous to my heart,"

263
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,133
"so have some mercy."

264
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:19,966
(Smiling)

265
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:22,066
"You seem to spend a lot of time
thinking alone,"

266
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,966
"but feel free to come and talk to me."

267
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,666
(Moved)

268
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,066
"And IAN, our dopamine generator."

269
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
"I'm so glad that you're one of us."

270
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,933
(Screening eye contact)

271
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,733
(The tearful zone)

272
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,300
"Thank you for making me laugh
all the time."

273
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,466
"You always lift the mood for all of us,"

274
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,433
"making the team a funny one."

275
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,866
"And the kill part you made was so cool.
I respect you."

276
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,433
I told you not to do this!

277
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:47,833
You're making me cry!

278
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,000
- She's crying.
- Oh, my.

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,633
(She burst into tears in the end.)

280
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,100
"And YE-ON, our youngest."

281
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:55,866
"You're really cute."

282
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,566
"Thank you for listening to me,
although you're the youngest one."

283
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:03,000
- "You're so reliable..."
- Stop!

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,533
- Please stop it!
- Stop it.

285
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,833
- Ridiculous.
- What's wrong with them?

286
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,233
"I admire your dedication
to everything you do."

287
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,033
"You're such an amazing person,"

288
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,300
"and I'm sure you'll be loved so much
in the future too."

289
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,466
I can't do this anymore!

290
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,766
(Breaking down in tears)

291
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:21,633
Oh, no.

292
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,766
"Don't worry about anything,
but trust yourself."

293
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,433
"I love you, Hearts2Hearts."

294
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,900
"Let's stay together
for the next 10, 20, and 30 years."

295
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,433
(JIWOO, you can't do this!)

296
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,466
Oh, my.

297
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,700
JIWOO, that was so touching.

298
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,100
- JIWOO, I think I'm going to cry.
- Are you okay?

299
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,266
Let's not do this, please!

300
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:39,700
YE-ON is crying.

301
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, our baby!

302
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:44,966
Don't cry.

303
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,966
(Patting)

304
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,166
It's time to listen to YE-ON's letter.

305
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:54,266
- No way!
- Come on, YE-ON!

306
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,633
Stop it!

307
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,600
"Dear beloved members of Hearts2Hearts."

308
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,100
(The youngest's words
instantly opened the floodgates.)

309
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,333
- Please stop!
- I think I'm going to cry a lot!

310
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,366
Gosh.

311
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:05,725
Don't cry.

312
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,200
"Hi. I'm YE-ON, the youngest member
of Hearts2Hearts."

313
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,300
She's so cute.

314
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,500
"It's my first time reading out
the letter I wrote to you,"

315
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,466
"so it feels a bit awkward."

316
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,100
"My trainee period was shorter
than yours,"

317
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,233
"so I never imagined I'd debut
as Hearts2Hearts with you."

318
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:36,633
"When I first heard I'd be debuting
with all of you,"

319
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,733
"I was surprised and delighted."

320
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,166
"After we became a team,"

321
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:45,666
"you helped me in many ways
and taught me lots of things."

322
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,366
"I'd like to thank all of you."

323
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:51,666
"Although I still need to improve a lot,"

324
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,266
"I'd appreciate it if you'd continue
supporting me."

325
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,300
"I love you always,
my Hearts2Hearts members."

326
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,066
"Lastly,"

327
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,500
"JIWOO, our leader,"

328
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,633
"thank you so much
for being a great leader."

329
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:11,000
"I'm so proud to have you as our leader."

330
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,133
"I feel so reassured when you're around."

331
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,600
"I love you, JIWOO."

332
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,333
"From YE-ON of Hearts2Hearts."

333
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,233
(The youngest's sincere message
made them cry.)

334
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,300
Oh, my!

335
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,933
Thank you, YE-ON.

336
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,766
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

337
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,133
A-NA, are you okay?

338
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,033
I'm okay.

339
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,200
(They're not okay.)

340
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,100
- CARMEN is crying too.
- Gosh.

341
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,878
How can I not cry?

342
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,333
You two really moved our hearts.

343
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,366
- It was so moving.
- When did you write the letters?

344
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,466
- Group hug time, everyone.
- Let's all hug it out.

345
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,966
What was that?

346
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,500
Everyone, come here.

347
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,666
- It was so unexpected.
- I was so surprised!

348
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,866
- When did you write it?
- You can't do this!

349
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,133
I wrote it sitting at the table
last night.

350
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,033
Gosh. You said
you were writing to your friend.

351
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,766
- It was us, not your friend!
- Right.

352
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,966
- I love you!
- I love you.

353
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,200
(Thanks to the mental health club,
they connected all hearts to heart!)

354
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,166
(The entertainment club with A-NA and IAN)

355
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,100
Girls!

356
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,800
We don't have time for this right now.

357
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
- Why?
- Actually...

358
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,666
What's going on?

359
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,900
Ta-da!

360
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,066
- What's that?
- Is that a laptop?

361
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,633
This laptop is password-protected.

362
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,166
If you decode it, you'll get a big reward.

363
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,266
(Eyes lit up at the news of reward.)

364
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,466
- What's that?
- Let's do this now.

365
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,300
How do we decode it?

366
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,600
You can find hints all over the classroom.

367
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
The classroom?

368
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:29,866
Let's look for them.

369
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,266
(The mission from the entertainment club)

370
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:34,000
(Find the questions hidden
all over the classroom.)

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,500
(Decode the password
by combining the hints.)

372
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,633
- Let's show them what we've got.
- Yes!

373
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:43,066
We should decode the tablet PC, right?

374
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,766
Let's look for the hints.

375
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:45,800
(Busy looking around)

376
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,066
Oh, like this one!

377
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,366
(YUHA, the troubleshooter,
figured out the way.)

378
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,733
You should just guess it.

379
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,433
Wouldn't it be our debut date?

380
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:57,866
Try it.

381
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,033
Okay.

382
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,500
(0224 is incorrect.)

383
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,133
(She gave up in an instant.)

384
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:05,966
Where is it?

385
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:08,100
(IAN looks at the locker.)

386
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,266
(And one locker stands out.)

387
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,200
Oh, my gosh! The strawberry!

388
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,333
(The name tag says, "Strawberry?")

389
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,000
I think this is it!

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,333
There are numbers in different colors.

391
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,433
I'm sure this is a hint.
Why else would it be here?

392
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,733
Like Strawberry.

393
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,400
"Watermelon." "Mango."

394
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,966
(The first question: What would be
the last letter of the password?)

395
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,566
Let's open all of them.

396
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,933
(How to find it? Just open all of them!)

397
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,366
Why is a camera in here?

398
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,833
- What's going on?
- Hi.

399
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,838
Did you find a camera?

400
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:40,933
- What's this?
- Goodness!

401
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,433
What's that?

402
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:43,333
It's creepy.

403
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,100
- What's this?
- What's this?

404
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,566
(Surprise presents are hidden
here and there.)

405
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:50,200
(The locker theme park seems
to be popular now.)

406
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,600
(YE-ON also faces the horror locker.)

407
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,866
There's only one shoe here.

408
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,424
(Are you the culprit?)

409
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,733
Oh, my gosh! Ew!

410
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,466
This is so scary.

411
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,533
There's a more scary thing
on the last locker.

412
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,366
(Robotic YE-ON rummages
every single locker.)

413
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,600
(And an eyeball dropped.)

414
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,733
(She even tidied up all the lockers.)

415
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,500
I think they all mean something.

416
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,033
(Meanwhile, IAN checks the laptop.)

417
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,133
(Let's try looking at it
with a calm head.)

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,433
(The lock screen appears right away.)

419
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,766
(Touching it a few times)

420
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,333
Girls! It says
it's a seven-letter password.

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,933
Seven letters?

422
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,033
Right.

423
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,966
(She found a huge hint.)

424
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,500
Are hints hidden over there only?

425
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:39,933
No, all over the classroom.

426
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,666
- Let's go check the front.
- Okay.

427
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:44,666
(Searching the front area)

428
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,033
These announcements look fishy.

429
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,266
Reporter Falabella wrote these.

430
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,566
Hints wouldn't be here, right?

431
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,433
(The bulletin board and mailbox)

432
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,200
It says, "Reporter Falabella."

433
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,300
(They found a lock pad.)

434
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,833
Isn't this a hint?

435
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,433
Maybe not. Right?

436
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,266
I see something inside.

437
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,366
(The second question:
The note inside the mailbox)

438
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,066
Can we open it?

439
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:15,666
Girls!

440
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,466
Let's open this first!

441
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,266
- Sure!
- What's in there?

442
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,666
What I'm sure is
that there's a camera inside.

443
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,666
- Right.
- And there's something else.

444
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,433
The dinner is tomato pasta.

445
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,033
Do we have tomato pasta for dinner?

446
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,666
It's my favorite.

447
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,966
(While the members are reading the menu,)

448
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:37,733
"Cucumbers, which I hate..."

449
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,400
"I should mark a star on the day
when cucumbers, which I hate, are served."

450
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:43,466
(That is 100 percent a hint.)

451
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,900
Move out.

452
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,866
The days when cucumbers...

453
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,400
Do you think it means something?

454
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,666
Let's just try it, anyway.

455
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,033
JIWOO!

456
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,533
Tell me when cucumbers are served.

457
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,100
What's the day?

458
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,443
(The two brainy girls' quick cooperation)

459
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,033
I don't know the dates.

460
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,600
It's a weekly menu.

461
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,166
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...

462
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,366
Why is it like this?

463
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,384
I don't understand
why it's got only four days.

464
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,799
What day is this?

465
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,233
(As it takes longer, they start to leave.)

466
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,100
(JIWOO is left all by herself
with persistence.)

467
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,863
(Does this have something to do
with the daily menu?)

468
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,533
(Maximum concentration)

469
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,722
Come here, guys.

470
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,933
- Did you solve it?
- She must've found something.

471
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,913
- What is it?
- How did you solve it?

472
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,133
Look.

473
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:36,377
- These three match them.
- They're the same with the latch buttons.

474
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,966
Type the three... Did it open?

475
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,366
It's unlocked.

476
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:41,387
That's crazy!

477
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,133
(JIWOO opened it.)

478
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,731
- You're a genius.
- You're awesome.

479
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,527
How did you open it?

480
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,496
(Mark the days
that cucumbers are included.)

481
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,766
(Apply the shape to the latch button.)

482
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,566
(The code is 2348.)

483
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,760
- It makes this shape.
- That matches the latch button.

484
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,133
That's amazing.

485
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,366
We're good at this.

486
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,909
- You're so smart.
- She's a genius.

487
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,580
(They obtain the note inside.)

488
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,382
- "SBN?"
- "SBN?"

489
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,033
(They got 3 letters out of 7 letters.)

490
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,300
I know what this is.

491
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,033
- I have the answer.
- What is it?

492
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:18,135
(They all move to the back this time.)

493
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,500
(Now, let me see.)

494
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,633
(I'm going to start thinking from now.)

495
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,866
(Writing down)

496
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,231
I know.

497
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,833
"The next word is SM."

498
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,835
"SM?"

499
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,733
- Did you just solve it?
- Yes.

500
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,966
Hold on. Explain it to us.

501
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:33,906
What's this?

502
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:35,901
(While JIWOO was being brilliant,)

503
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,685
(she focused on the lockers.)

504
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:38,900
How did you open it?

505
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,066
(Back to focus)

506
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,566
(She wrote down something passionately.)

507
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,366
(YUHA grasped the problem.)

508
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,566
(And she figured out an English sentence.)

509
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,510
The yellow three equals the letter N.

510
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,878
According to such a rule,
I got "Next word?"

511
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,333
Then, "S" and blank.

512
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,398
- So, I thought it was SM.
- I see.

513
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,101
The next word should be SM.

514
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,033
I think she's right.

515
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,100
The next...

516
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,939
"Next word, SM!"

517
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,442
It's "Next word, SM!"

518
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,145
Wait a minute. Come here, guys.

519
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,482
- I found something.
- What is it?

520
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,700
(The world map
with the names of the countries)

521
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,400
(What do the country names
on the map have in common?)

522
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,700
- They don't have it.
- What?

523
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,027
The letter R is missing.

524
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,700
Brazil, Argentina,

525
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,933
Australia, Africa,

526
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,400
and the Arctic Ocean. There are no Rs.

527
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,233
- They all don't have an R.
- No Rs.

528
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,566
(The password has the letter R.)

529
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,366
SBNR...

530
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,466
(They got five letters immediately.)

531
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,233
You're so smart.

532
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:43,678
Those who were born in 2007 are brilliant.

533
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,277
This is awesome.

534
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,480
We'll solve all the problems.

535
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:48,881
This is fun.

536
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,666
(The mystery enthusiast is satisfied.)

537
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,254
Of course, I know them too.

538
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,722
But I'm just pretending I don't know.

539
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,466
I should let the smart ones do the work.

540
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,727
The next word has an S...

541
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,766
And the blank should be R.
The map was missing it.

542
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:06,698
But what do R and SBN mean?

543
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,900
Or we could make a word with those.

544
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,700
- SBNR.
- SBNR.

545
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,339
And we keep finding the letters.

546
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,500
There are no hidden things, though.

547
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,811
- Where could it be?
- I really have no clue.

548
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,335
Should the suggestion box
have something in it?

549
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,050
It could be hidden in places like this.

550
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:27,253
I found a key here.

551
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:29,133
- Hey!
- Open it just in case.

552
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,489
She's right.

553
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,816
Everything can be a clue.

554
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,666
I figured that out
while playing the escape room.

555
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
(Open it.)

556
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,564
- There's nothing inside.
- Really?

557
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,323
Yes.

558
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,666
(Checking the inside of the drawer)

559
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:45,200
(She's almost sucked into it.)

560
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,400
(Checking everything suspicious)

561
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,433
(YE-ON also starts searching
for the clue.)

562
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,533
What's this?

563
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,833
(The search party of three does
their best.)

564
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:56,533
A hint inside?

565
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:57,733
(YUHA joins the search.)

566
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,823
(Squat walking)

567
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
(She found something suspicious.)

568
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,189
What is this?

569
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,358
There's a fox.

570
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:08,427
Flamingo.

571
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:10,566
(Falabella)

572
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,333
Look at this, guys!

573
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,406
- What is it?
- Where?

574
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,067
There's a Falabella.

575
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,600
- Isn't this just a prop?
- I agree.

576
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,500
I think so too.

577
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,642
It's just a school prop.

578
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,508
And it happens to have Falabella?

579
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,410
There's no way.

580
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,366
(The fourth problem:
What the animals have in common)

581
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,523
That should be the crucial clue.

582
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,284
I don't think so.

583
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Let's check other drawers for more.

584
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:39,233
(Chasing the wrong lead)

585
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:40,766
- It's empty, right?
- Yes.

586
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:41,894
I don't see any.

587
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,133
I have no clue.

588
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,633
(It's hard to become the king of mystery.)

589
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,666
But why does it have Falabella?

590
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,600
How do we earn the hints?

591
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,400
(She gives up on the word cards.)

592
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,109
Let's list all the words
we've found so far.

593
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,366
- The one at the locker was M.
- The SM.

594
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,100
An R from the map.

595
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,666
- The senior.
- SBN.

596
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,866
The password is seven letters?

597
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:04,833
- Yes.
- There are seven.

598
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,300
(They still need two more.)

599
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,000
(What should we do?)

600
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:10,766
It's too difficult.

601
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,166
(IAN pauses in front of the blackboard.)

602
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,533
Girls, I think I found it.

603
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,233
(She found something from the blackboard?)

604
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,764
Girls, I think I found it.

605
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,483
This should be "baking."

606
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:22,866
Baking?

607
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:24,503
So, it's "bang?"

608
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,633
(The fifth problem:
An erased letter on the blackboard)

609
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,426
(Hold on.)

610
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,610
- We should get the note.
- Maybe it's "007 bang?"

611
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,579
How come?

612
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:36,831
The letters above the arrows are 007.

613
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,784
(It says "007 bang" in Korean.)

614
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,900
(Incredible!)

615
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:43,733
- So, it's bang?
- Bang!

616
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:44,623
Bang.

617
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,058
Zero sounds the same.

618
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:47,826
- Right. Bang.
- So, it's zero!

619
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:49,166
It's zero.

620
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,400
(That's the first number they got.)

621
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,599
Alphabet O.

622
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,866
(The answer is O.)

623
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,833
(They got one more answer,
thanks to YUHA, IAN, and YE-ON.)

624
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,033
Wasn't I amazing with that bang thing?

625
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,266
Praise me.

626
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,910
I found out that "zero."

627
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,600
You are pretty smart.

628
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,647
This is it! I found something.

629
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,249
Oh, geez.

630
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
We also call zero bang, so...

631
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,666
(She found out
the number of the letters...)

632
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,966
(and that they were in the alphabet.)

633
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,633
(She found the hint on the lockers,)

634
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:21,100
(found the bulletin board,)

635
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,866
(and found out the letter
from the blackboard.)

636
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,600
Now, I'll let my members solve them.

637
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,732
We got this!

638
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
(Examining the alphabet)

639
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
There should be seven letters.

640
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,500
- We need one more letter.
- What do we have so far?

641
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,774
Don't we know any words
with seven letters?

642
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:39,266
(The hint fairy passes by.)

643
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,666
- I think you're right.
- Sor...

644
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,866
Sre...

645
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:45,300
Bro...

646
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:46,719
What is this?

647
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:50,356
Maybe it's not English.

648
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:52,200
(Let's pay attention to the hint fairy.)

649
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,659
There should be something.

650
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,633
I'm sure this holds some kind of a clue.

651
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,466
I know it has something to do with this.

652
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,766
Yes, the frog and all.

653
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,055
(Assisting)

654
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,166
(The hint fairy fulfills her duty.)

655
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,743
What do you know, Falabella?

656
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:09,300
"Yeo, gae, hong, fal..."

657
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,833
(Reading the first words)

658
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:13,512
Nice try.

659
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,166
It's hard.

660
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,148
Fal...

661
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,684
Please write all of them in English.

662
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,885
What? Okay.

663
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,488
Fox, fro, flamingo...

664
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,557
The missing letter is F.

665
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,200
- Yes, she's right.
- The letter is F.

666
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,021
Firefly... It is F.

667
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,000
(This is perfect.)

668
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,500
And thus, we'll get the word!

669
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,802
(I knew you smart ones could do it!)

670
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,866
- What did we find the first?
- Well...

671
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,366
We found SBN first.

672
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:41,433
- And R.
- The next one is R.

673
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:43,500
- And O.
- So, it must be M.

674
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,543
And F.

675
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:49,955
(They obtained all seven letters.)

676
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,450
We have to come up with a word.

677
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:52,766
SBN...

678
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:54,300
(Typing it randomly)

679
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,166
And R...

680
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,000
- But the order we found doesn't matter.
- Right. It's got nothing to do with it.

681
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,447
It's irrelevant.

682
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:02,273
I'll help you. What do you need?

683
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,633
(Focused)

684
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,531
- I cracked the password!
- What?

685
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,434
Wait a minute!

686
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,666
What was it?

687
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,666
(She solved it with tenacity.)

688
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,643
(A present for H2H)

689
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:16,147
(What just happened?)

690
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:17,172
- How did you get it?
- What was it?

691
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,461
- I just...
- SBN...

692
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:21,333
- How did you get it?
- What's the password?

693
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,815
FROM SBN.

694
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,600
(If you arrange the letters correctly...)

695
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,066
So, that's the combined word.

696
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,511
"A present for H2H."

697
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,622
That must be it.

698
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,666
- A present for us?
- Shall we open it?

699
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,300
Let's see what's in there.

700
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,161
What does "FROM SBN" mean?

701
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:37,400
Let's find out.

702
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,697
In 1, 2, 3!

703
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,166
(A surprise present is here for you.)

704
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,266
We got a present!

705
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:46,572
(What is the present?)

706
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,400
(What is causing them to shout?)

707
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:55,047
Hello, this is Kangta.

708
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:58,417
Our new group, Hearts2Hearts, has
successfully made their debut!

709
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,927
This is incredible.

710
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,366
- Kangta...
- So, it actually meant our senior.

711
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:05,891
- I told you it was that.
- I also got it right.

712
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,830
(The Robot YE-ON has never been
this surprised in her life.)

713
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,333
I came to realize
that always feeling grateful...

714
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:16,266
for the staff, our fans, and everyone else
was the most essential.

715
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:19,366
With such a mindset,
I hope Hearts2Hearts grows into a group...

716
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:21,733
that reaches out to the whole world.

717
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:22,566
I'll root for you.

718
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,866
(The unexpected celebrating message
from Kangta.)

719
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,366
And BoA!

720
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:29,966
Hello, this is BoA.

721
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:34,900
I sincerely welcome
the Hearts3Hearts as one of us.

722
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,600
Through the music
that you're about to present,

723
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,733
I hope you can connect the world in one.

724
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:42,433
I'll also root for you.

725
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,433
Once again, congratulations on your debut.

726
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:47,066
I'll look forward
to your amazing performances.

727
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,000
Way to go!

728
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,566
Since I know there are...

729
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:53,200
- very high expectations for them,
- It's TVXQ!

730
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,933
I truly hope they do their best.

731
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:57,566
It's a large-member girl group
that SM is introducing...

732
00:27:57,566 --> 00:28:00,233
- for the first time in a long while.
- This is unbelievable.

733
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,366
Since they have many members,

734
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:04,200
I hope they will make a cover of our song.

735
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,133
- Of course!
- We'd love that.

736
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,366
So, it keeps getting talked about?

737
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:07,686
We're more than willing to do it!

738
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,866
- That was embarrassing.
- I guess you...

739
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,625
I can't help but want...

740
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,021
to introduce them to people
as our youngest group.

741
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:16,566
- And I want to protect them.
- He's so sweet!

742
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:19,565
We'll be everywhere for you guys,

743
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,866
so you guys can just focus
on your performance.

744
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,731
- This is so heart-warming.
- Yes!

745
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,208
- Congratulations on your debut!
- Congrats!

746
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,366
Hearts2Hearts.

747
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:33,466
I heard the youngest member
was born in 2010.

748
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:36,165
That's when we released "Bonamana."

749
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:39,675
I noticed something new
as I watched their teaser video.

750
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,966
I could tell they were different...

751
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:44,100
from how their performance from it.

752
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,933
I got the feeling
that they'd be successful.

753
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,866
- And I hope they stay happy.
- Right.

754
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:51,266
I hope to see you in "Knowing Bros."
one day.

755
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,433
- Of course!
- Bye, Hearts2Hearts!

756
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:54,366
We'd love it!

757
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,600
Hi, girls.

758
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,302
This is Kwon Yu Ri, your senior.

759
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,866
(Screaming in a group)

760
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,233
I heard there were eight members
in your group,

761
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:07,700
and I thought it was really similar
to Girls' Generation.

762
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
However,

763
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,483
it is never easy
to be like Girls' Generation.

764
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:15,666
I hope you work harder...

765
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:19,866
and finally open the era of Hearts2Hearts.

766
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:21,446
I'll always root for you.

767
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,100
(Shedding tears)

768
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,000
They'd be practicing hard
somewhere even now...

769
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,500
because I know how passionate they are.

770
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,203
I can't wait to see what they'll show us.

771
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:33,171
I look forward...

772
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,925
- to their amazing performances.
- This is incredible.

773
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,876
Hello, this is Lim Yoon A.

774
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:39,845
(Screaming continues.)

775
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:42,300
(A-NA's role model got her tearing up.)

776
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,351
I bet their name, "Hearts2Hearts,"
may still sound unfamiliar,

777
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,400
yet it also stirs excitement in them,

778
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,700
spending the happiest time of their lives.

779
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,800
I hope you guys always stay healthy...

780
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,433
and truly enjoy being Hearts2Hearts.

781
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,833
I hope we meet someday!

782
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,700
- You got this!
- Thank you...

783
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,166
(She can't stop crying.)

784
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:07,566
(Who's the next surprise?)

785
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,000
Hello, this is MINHO of SHINee.

786
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,966
Nice to meet you.

787
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:12,533
If there's any struggle you go through,

788
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,933
- or you want to talk to someone,
- My goodness.

789
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:17,166
I'll try my best to help you.

790
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:21,109
- And I'll always try to reach out.
- How they all agreed to do this...

791
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,200
- Let's go, H2H!
- Thank you!

792
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,433
Hello, this is CHANYEOL of EXO.

793
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,366
I watched your music video,

794
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,200
and you were all
very gorgeous and amazing.

795
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,322
- I thought you were...
- This is unbelievable.

796
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:34,209
exactly the kind of talent
that is expected from SM.

797
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,600
- You got this.
- We got this!

798
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,500
Hello, this is Seulgi of Red Velvet.

799
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,233
I was so excited by the news
that we had...

800
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,866
our newest and youngest group.

801
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:47,933
As I watched Hearts2Hearts' performance,
I was very impressed,

802
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:51,333
and it made me also want to practice
the choreography.

803
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,700
I'll always root for you! Bye!

804
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:55,954
I'm Wendy from Red Velvet.

805
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:58,557
(Wendy is STELLA's role model)

806
00:30:58,582 --> 00:30:59,758
This is awesome.

807
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:03,400
I hope you can sing
your heart out on the stage.

808
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,533
I'll always support you no matter what,

809
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,300
like you always supported me!

810
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,633
Love you! Bye-bye.

811
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:10,711
- To the world! This is NCT.
- To the world! This is NCT.

812
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,266
- Hello, we're NCT.
- Hello, we're NCT.

813
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,966
I hope your career
will be fun and delightful.

814
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:17,166
And your health comes first
more than anything,

815
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,233
so try to stay healthy.

816
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,546
- Let's go, Hearts2Hearts!
- Let's go, Hearts2Hearts!

817
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,066
- Congratulations on your debut!
- Congratulations!

818
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:28,466
- As one of the youngest members in NCT,
- This is so touching.

819
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,366
what would you like to say to them?

820
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:31,633
Just try your best.

821
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,733
Things can go well,
but it can go bad sometimes.

822
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:35,833
- It's important...
- How is this possible?

823
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,700
- to leave no regrets.
- This is surreal.

824
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,233
- Hello, we're WavY!
- Hello, we're WavY!

825
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,600
Not to mention your song,
it was an excellent performance.

826
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,833
I'm really into "The Chase" these days.

827
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:47,866
Also,

828
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,841
CARMEN!

829
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,977
As a foreign member,

830
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:54,342
- if you face any difficulties,
- Thank you!

831
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:57,500
we will be here to support you!

832
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,600
Count on us.

833
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,851
Trust this brother!

834
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,466
(We do!)

835
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:03,955
- My gosh!
- That's crazy.

836
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,600
- Hello, we're asepa.
- Hello, we're asepa.

837
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,761
We send out sincere congratulations
on your debut!

838
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:14,000
We know how all of you have worked
so hard...

839
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,022
from your trainee days to your debut.

840
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,900
I hope you keep enjoying your journey...

841
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,166
and create wonderful memories
with your members and fans.

842
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:25,110
We'll root for your future journey.

843
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:27,166
- Hello, we're RIIZE.
- Hello, we're RIIZE.

844
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:30,400
I remember how nervous I was
on our debut stage.

845
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,100
But because I had my members,
I was able to finish it successfully.

846
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,933
I suggest you think
that you own the stage...

847
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,700
- when you perform.
- "I own this stage."

848
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,133
A rising star in the global spotlight,
Hearts2Hearts.

849
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,733
We'll also root for you guys.

850
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,166
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

851
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,200
- To the world! It's NCT!
- To the world! It's NCT!

852
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,033
- Hello, we're NCT WISH.
- Hello, we're NCT WISH.

853
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,200
It's been just over a year
since our debut.

854
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,300
But already, we have a junior group.

855
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,100
We still have a long way to go,

856
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,266
and I'm a bit sad
that we're not the youngest group anymore.

857
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:01,980
As a fellow young group,
let's keep things up together.

858
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:05,475
- We can do it!
- We hope you receive...

859
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,766
a lot of love from the world.

860
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:09,966
- Let's go, Hearts2Hearts!
- Let's go, Hearts2Hearts!

861
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:15,866
(The senior groups of SM send
their congrats on H2H's debut.)

862
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,666
- This was such a surprise.
- It was amazing.

863
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,833
I can't thank you enough.

864
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,533
(It still lingers for A-NA,
the ultimate feeler.)

865
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:27,400
Are you crying?

866
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,433
She's still crying?

867
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:31,166
- I'm tearing up too.
- It was unbelievable.

868
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,500
This is the moment when I truly feel...

869
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
- that we've debuted.
- Same.

870
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,966
Each of our role models sent us
such a great message,

871
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:41,066
- which made us so happy.
- Totally.

872
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:43,033
I didn't expect anything like this.

873
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:44,300
Okay. In 2, 3!

874
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,359
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

875
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:49,276
- Thank you so much.
- We really appreciate it.

876
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm actually crying.

877
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,400
I almost cried too.

878
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,966
I also shed tears watching it.

879
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,833
- A lot went through in my mind.
- Right.

880
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,807
- It was so touching.
- And heart-warming.

881
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:05,100
The seniors we really look up to
and love rooted for us.

882
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,600
So, let's do our best.

883
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,466
- Let's work hard.
- We should really work hard.

884
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:12,166
We have to carry on the legacy they built.

885
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,666
Absolutely.

886
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,033
Knowing that our seniors are...

887
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:19,066
always supporting us from behind
gave me so much strength.

888
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,166
Do you think this is too much?

889
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:23,333
She's so funny.

890
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,766
I'm sorry, guys.

891
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:25,633
- Gosh, IAN.
- It's still here.

892
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:29,066
I thought I was able to gain energy
through this.

893
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,433
- Right.
- Me too.

894
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:32,070
It was nice to be at school after a while.

895
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:33,633
Right. And the uniform too.

896
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:35,707
We wore uniform a lot
on the stage, though.

897
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:38,120
You are right, but...

898
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,700
(She's indeed the student leader.)

899
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,533
This reality show was so much fun.

900
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,566
- I can't believe it's ending already.
- It's the last episode.

901
00:34:43,566 --> 00:34:45,400
We shoot the first episode...

902
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,333
- before our debut.
- Right.

903
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,555
- So, I feel more attached to this show.
- Yes.

904
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:52,766
- This feels strange.
- I'm getting mixed emotions.

905
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:54,000
I can't really explain it.

906
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,933
We must get the second season!

907
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,033
- She's right!
- For sure!

908
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:59,133
- I'm sure everyone wants it.
- There should be next season.

909
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,866
There will be a second season.

910
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,566
Please give a lot of support
for this season...

911
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:03,933
so there'll be next season.

912
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:06,433
Let's watch it all together at home.

913
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:08,100
- I'd love that.
- Sounds great.

914
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,200
With loving hearts for each other...

915
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,341
Come on.

916
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:14,633
- Don't be shy.
- Keep going.

917
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:16,500
Shall we wrap up by shouting,
"I love you?"

918
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,366
Okay.

919
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,433
- I love you!
- I love you!

920
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:22,233
- Congratulations on our debut!
- Congratulations on our debut!

921
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,800
Let's keep working hard, H2H!

922
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,600
- We love you, S2U!
- We'll see you in the next season!

923
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,433
- We hope to see you in the next season!
- Let's meet again!

924
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:29,833
- Bye!
- Bye!

925
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,266
(Saving the data of H2H's school days)

926
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:37,533
(Is there any other data on H2H?)

927
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,366
(Importing the second season...)
