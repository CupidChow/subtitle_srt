What?

405
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,270
What's going on between you and Qin Mengxuan?

406
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,330
Qin Mengxuan just transferred here.

407

I didn't know Cao Jia'er would transfer here.

408
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,310
What a coincidence.

409
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,820
Chen Miren,

410
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,740
can you talk properly?

Fine.

413
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,820
Let me ask you.

414
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,470
On the day when you and Cao Jia'er had a meal and watched a movie together,

415
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,480
I called you.

416
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,720
She was the one who answered my call. Why?

417
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,040
You called me?

418
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,880
Chen Miren, why did you give me that look?

419
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,940
You don't trust me?

420
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,610
Right.

421
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,670
You have never trusted me since the beginning.

422
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,820
So after Cao Jia'er came to me

423
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,770
in high school,

424
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,740
you suddenly transferred to another school

425
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,830
without telling me.

426
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,960
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

427
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,940
Let's go.

428
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,890
We're running out of time.

429
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,220
I went to Nanchizi Park to watch the sunrise

430
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,990
and watch a movie with Cao Jia'er.

431
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,650
I satisfied her so many unreasonable requests.

432
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,180
I did what I did because I was afraid you would break up with me

433
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,310
if you see her again.

434
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,300
Who did I do that for?

435
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,870
I did that for you.

436
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,260
You had dinner, watched a movie,

437
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,810
went on a date,

438
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,060
and revisited a place with another girl.

439
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,950
And you are saying you did those for me.

440
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,410
I really should thank you.

Bao Jiaguo,

442
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,650

443
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,680
Not bad.

444
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,050

445
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,700
I'll have a match tomorrow.

446
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,790
Can you come and cheer for me?

447
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,470
You know how to play basketball too?

448
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,260
Of course.

449
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm good at it.

450
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:25,610
Okay.

451
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,460
You have never trusted me since the beginning.

452
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,300
So after Cao Jia'er came to me

453
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,300
in high school,

454
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,320
you suddenly transferred to another school

Have you ever cared about my feelings?

457
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,800
Chen Miren,

458
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,420
do I look good wearing this?

459
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,510
Didn't you two go out

460
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,400
after the basketball match that day?

461
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,730
You haven't made up yet?

462
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,810
No.

463
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,630
Because of Cao Jia'er?

464
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,580
If you really like Zhong Wei,

465
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,570
don't care who she is.

466
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,670
Just get him back.

467
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,440
Didn't you say

468
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,840
it ends badly for those who have stolen someone else's identity?

469
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,330
They live a miserable life.

470
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,250
You believe in novels?

471
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,270
Besides,

472
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,360
I think Zhong Wei really likes you.

473
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,510
You are not a substitute at all.

474
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,500
You're the heroine.

475
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,850
Don't always think yourself as a villain.

476
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,010
Where are you going?

477
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,580
Bao Jiaguo asked me to watch a basketball match.

478
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,630
It seems that you have made progress in pursuing Bao Jiaguo.

479
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,440
If a girl wants something,

480
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,800
she should strive to get it.

481
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,600
You too.

482
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,550
Don't stay in the dorm.

483
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,570
Go out for a walk.

484
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,700
How about watching the match with me?

485
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,430
I don't want to be a third wheel.

486
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,430
I'll go out for a walk alone later.

487
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,400
You go now.

488
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I'm leaving then.

489
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,140
Catch it.

490
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,420
Go.

491
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,490
Here, catch it.

492
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,660

497
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,230
You won this time.

498
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,310
I've never wanted to compete with you.

499
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,310
Haven't you been competing with me?

500
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,080
First, you replaced me to be with Zhong Wei for so long.

501
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,390
Now, even after you broke up,

502
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,450
you don't want me to be with Zhong Wei.

503
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,090
I'm not as bored as you think.

504

Chen Miren,

505

you've had Zhong Wei for so long.

506
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,050
It's time for you to give him back to me, right?

507
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,340
Do you think Zhong Wei is something

508
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,680
that I can just give back?

509
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,900

512
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,000
I suddenly realized

513

even without me back then,

514
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,050
Zhong Wei still wouldn't be with you.
