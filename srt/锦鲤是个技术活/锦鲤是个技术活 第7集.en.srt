I've been preparing for interviews for a long time,

396

but I didn't pass any one of them.

Domestic graduates are no match for those who have studied abroad.

at the starting line.

403

After I started looking for a job, I found

that there are indeed many opportunities in first-tier cities.

405

But the competition is very fierce.

406
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,690

And I need to eat and drink.

409
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,760
And there are classmate parties and social relations.

410
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,090
Even if I live frugally,

411
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,940
it will cost at least 4,000 yuan a month.

412

The average salary of the current graduates

00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,160
Taking postgraduate entrance exams won't give me too many advantages now.

513
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,290
Those who have studied abroad are a little competitive.

514
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
I still think

515
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,280
you are too cruel to Shi Hou.

516
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,330
Am I right, Chen Miren?

517
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,240
Love can't be forced.

518
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,790
It's meaningless to flatter oneself.

519
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,600
Does she like Zhong Wei?

520
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,660
I've asked her. No.

521
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,130
Xu Miaomiao, you are pretty.

522
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,900
But when it comes to love,

523
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,060
you know nothing.

524
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,770
She's obviously having a crush on Zhong Wei.

525
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,460
Otherwise, who would have moved

526
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,410
a life-size cutout here and there?

527
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,590
It seems you have a point.

528
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,160
Does she have masochistic inclinations?

529
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,920
When Zhong Wei treated her badly,

530
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,150
she gradually fell in love with him.

531
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,670
Xu Miaomiao,

532
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,300
you should find a boyfriend.

533
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,000
You said it like I've never been in a relationship.

534
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,660
I've been in too many relationships. I'm tired.

535
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,260
I... I want to take a break.

536
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,960
Did you miss me?

537
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,200
Chen Miren.

538
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,700
Why didn't you tell me the action figures have been delivered?

539
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,700
Let me take a look.

540
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,380
Don't open it.

541
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,040
What?

542
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,120
It's not convenient to carry it after you open it.

543
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,320
I helped you

544
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
get the action figures.

545
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,410
At least give me one as a souvenir.

546
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,370
No.

547
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,460
No?

548
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,320
I mean

549
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,940
they are very meaningful.

550
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,860
If I just give one to you,

551
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,960
there won't be a sense of ceremony.

552
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,590
A sense of ceremony?

553
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,700
Zhong Wei,

554
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,580
I'm very happy that I finished my first work

555
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,990
with you.

556
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,640
As long as you are happy.

557
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,530
I hope

558
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,840
we can do more together in the future.

559
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,620
Chen Miren, you're right.

560
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,040
Such an important thing

561
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,500
needs a sense of ceremony.

562
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,250
Yes.

563
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,780
Let me do it.

564
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,580
No need.

565
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,300
Let me do it. It's okay.

566
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,720
No need.

567
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,380
Let me do it.

568
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,910
Come on.

569
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,780
Chen Miren,

570
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,730
is this your maiden work?

571
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,240
Not bad.

572
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,860
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

573
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,960
I have an interview next week.

574
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,600
I'm so stressed.

575
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,760
Don't worry.

576
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,880
You're talented. You will succeed.

577
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,470
I mean it.

578
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,250
So beautiful.

579
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,150
Mr. Cao.

580
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,990
Okay, let's begin.

581
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,480
You don't even understand the basic knowledge points.

582
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
If this continues,

583
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,020
you'll definitely fail.

584
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,300
It's...

585
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,430
What?

586
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,050
Go back

587
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,970
and study the knowledge points you don't understand.

588
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:22,990
Okay.

589
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,920
I'll read the book after I go back tonight.

590
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,050
I won't sleep until I understand them.

591
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,650
Sir, goodbye.

592
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,860
Sir, thank you.

593
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,370
Chen Miren.

594
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,650
In Chapter 2 of differential coefficient and integral,

595
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,300
there are many knowledge points, and they are dispersed.

596
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,740
The content related to integral in Chapter 4 and 5

597
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,840
is also the key points of the exam.

598
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,700
And differential equation is also crucial to get points.

599
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,540
You also need to remember

600
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,730
common properties of functions.

601
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,130
Lastly, you must be very familiar

602
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
with the two important limit formulas.

603
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,360
Understand?

604
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,020
Then repeat what I said.

605
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,950
I have my own way.

606
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,510
It's different from yours.

607
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,540
Don't think everything you say is right

608
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,940
just because you are a straight-A student.

609
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,540
Chen Miren

610
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,670
has been really abnormal recently.

611
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,020
You also noticed that?

612
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,410
I brought snacks today,

613
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,410
but she didn't eat any.

614
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,250
It's indeed not normal.

615
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,820
That's just a superficial phenomenon.

616
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,470
Didn't you notice

617
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,630
that she seems to be avoiding someone?

618
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,690
Avoiding?

619
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,610
Avoiding whom?

620
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,780
If she's avoiding someone, it must be Mr. Cao.

621
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,150
If I get bad results

622
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,400
and frequently skip classes like her,

623
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,380
I'll avoid him too.

624
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,470
You two

625
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,610
are no better than each other.

626
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,270
Let me tell you, the Advanced Math exam will come in two days.

627
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,900
The results in regular exams will be included in the total score.

628
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,810
The result in the final exam will influence the comprehensive score.

629
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,030
If the comprehensive score doesn't meet the standard,

630
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,270
it will definitely affect graduation.

631
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,420
So, don't fail the exam.

632
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,179
Even if I fail, Chen Miren will be the bottom of the class,

633
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,900
not me.

634
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,580
Zhong Wei, can you concentrate?

635
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,340
The new chapter of A Caged Bird

636
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,739
is really interesting.

637
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,159
Listen.

638
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,570
The male lead wants to pursue the heroine, who is the class belle.

639
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,409
The heroine has bad grades.

640
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,170
So the male lead wants to lend his notes to her.

641
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,370
But he doesn't want to hurt her pride.

642
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,480
So the male lead gives the notes

643
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,510
to the heroine's best friend.

644
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,389
Chen Miren, is it sweet?

645
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,290
Chen Miren, no need to return it to me in a rush.

646
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,270
Is it sweet?

647
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,930
A little salty. I'm going to buy some water.

648
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,020
Chen Miren,

649
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,290
Zhong Wei was looking for you everywhere.

650
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,290
What does he want?

651
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,210
Help me give it back to Zhong Wei.

652
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,100
Zhong Wei's class notes.

653
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,360
Seeing this is like cheating.

654
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,880
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
