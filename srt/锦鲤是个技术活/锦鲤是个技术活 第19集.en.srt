Today's game had a huge gap in strength.

6
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,120
In less than a minute,

7
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,150
Bao Jiaguo made a spike

8
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,340
that left the opponents completely helpless.

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
Chen Miren, you're back.

10
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,270
Let me tell you.

11
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,200
Bao Jiaguo won the table tennis championship today.

12
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,350
What's wrong?

13
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,490
I just ran into Cao Jia'er.

14
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,090
You ran into Cao Jia'er?

15
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,340
And then?

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,570
She asked me to return Zhong Wei to her.

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,229
She talked like Zhong Wei belonged to her.

18
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,120
Ignore her.

Chen Miren and Zhong Wei have broken up.

So what?

22
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,280
They can get back together.

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,580
Chen Miren transferred schools once

24
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,380
because of Cao Jia'er.

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,310
I think Zhong Wei and Chen Miren

26
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,820
lack trust in each other.

27
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,560
Zhong Wei is afraid that Chen Miren will be troubled

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,450
when she sees Cao Jia'er again,

29
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,250
so he wants to handle it himself.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,600
But Chen Miren doesn't believe

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,220
that Zhong Wei just wants to resolve the issue.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,520
I think Zhao Gu is right.

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,470
But

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,220
right now, we can't be sure

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,250
if Zhong Wei

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,040
wants to resolve things with Cao Jia'er

37
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,230
or just rekindle old feelings with her.

38

What are you talking about, Luo Si?

39

What old feelings did they have?

40

Zhong Wei just wants to make sure

41
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,070
that Chen Miren doesn't feel uncomfortable seeing Cao Jia'er

42
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,670
and he wants to minimize any potential issues.

43
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,500

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,620
Give it a try.

170
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,970
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,180
I'll pay for it.

172
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,340
Huang Xiaoyue.

173
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,500
Tell me the truth.

174
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,380
Are you Cao Jia'er's spy?

175
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,310
She's fat, so she doesn't want me to be thin, right?

176
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,710
Of course not.

177
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,920
Then why have you been making excuses

178
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,880
to bring us food?

179
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,980
Tell us.

180
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,980
What are you up to?

181
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,340
Well...

182
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,640
I'll tell you.

183
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,020
The mastermind is Zhong Wei.

184
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,450
Did you just expose me like that?

185
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,380
But I've explained

186
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,350
that you did this

187
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,790
to be good to Chen Miren.

188
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,310
But Xu Miaomiao said

189
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,390
that you hated Chen Miren so much

190
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,530
that you wanted her to get destructively fat,

191
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,610
and end up lonely.

192
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,070
You can't blame me.

193
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,410
I told you

194
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,980
that your trick was so lame

195
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,390
that you would get exposed sooner or later.

196
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,440
What did Chen Miren say?

197
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,350
Chen Miren...

198
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,200
I don't want to

199
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,750
argue with him on such boring tricks.

200
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,500
Zhong Wei.

201
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,780
I finally found that

202
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,810
your enemy is not only Qin Mengxuan.

203
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,060
Who else?

204
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,460
Xu Miaomiao, Luo Si and Zhao Gu.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,530
Then what should I do?

206
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,430
Turn enemies into friends

207
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,200
and clear the obstacles.

208
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
So you mean

209
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,410
there's nothing between you and Cao Jia'er,

210
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,340
and it's just a misunderstanding?

211
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,670
You went on a movie date with Cao Jia'er

212
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,500
because you were afraid that after she showed up,

213
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,200
Chen Miren would break up with you again.

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,480
So you wanted to meet her requirements

215
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,110
and send her back to America?

216
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,950
But unexpectedly,

217
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,630
Cao Jia'er transferred here.

218
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,580
Yes.

219
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,750
So do you believe in

220
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,350
what Zhong Wei said?

221
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,560
I believe Zhong Wei.

222
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,700
After all,

223
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,110
the more handsome a man is, the more devoted he is.

224
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,000
My Fang Mao is just an example.

225
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,030
I just simply think

226
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,430
that from the perspective of input and output ratio,

227
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,620
the only possibility for Zhong Wei

228
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,500
to win back Chen Miren

229
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,520
is true love.

230
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,910
Let's vote.

231
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,680
Raise your hand if you believe Zhong Wei.

232
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
We decided

233
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,680
to believe you.

234
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,200
We'll explain this to Chen Miren for you.

235
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,050
I've explained everything.

236
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,120
It's useless.

237
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,570
I originally thought

238
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,180
that over time,

239
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,890
Chen Miren would realize

240
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,900
that there's nothing between me and Cao Jia'er.

241
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,720
But I didn't expect

242
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,580
Qin Mengxuan to come out halfway.

243
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,750
What if before Chen Miren finds out about the truth,

244
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,690
she and Qin Mengxuan were together?

245
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,090
How could it be?

246
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,140
Why would she choose Qin Mengxuan instead of you?

247
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,600
Why not?

248
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,820
Now there's a Cao Jia'er standing between you.

249
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,520
Chen Miren has already misunderstood Zhong Wei.

250
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,510
At this moment, Qin Mengxuan

251
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,330
launched a fierce pursuit,

252
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,530
who can withstand it?

253
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,750
Let me be frank.

254
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,660
Qin Mengxuan's pursuit

255
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,310
is indeed hard to refuse.

256
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,620
Right?

257
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,590
You think so too, right?

258
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
Don't worry.

259
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,270
You have us.

260
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,820
Yes.

261
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,980
We'll help you.

262
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,240
Thank you.

263
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,050
Let's watch a movie tomorrow.

264
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,510
The movies that are in cinema recently are so lame.

265
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,600
Whoever watches them will regret it.

266
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,060
I heard that

267
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,100
Qin Mengxuan

268
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,760
is dating Guo Haomei

269
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,330
from the broadcasting class.

270
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:39,980
Recently,

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,980
Huang Xiaoyue saw them

272
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,170
going to the woods together.

273
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,050
Chen Miren.

274
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,540
The exam is coming.

275
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,890
Are you prepared for it?

276
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,340
Look! Look!

277
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,760
He's so handsome!

278
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,910
[Literature]

279
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,250
[Warm hint]

280
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,230
What're you doing?

281
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,300
Reading.

282
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,120
There are so many empty seats.

283
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,580
Why do you have to sit here?

284
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,470
The library is a public place.

285
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,990
I can sit wherever I want.

286
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
Excuse me.

287
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,090
This seat is taken.

288
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,590
Please leave.

289
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,840
But...

290
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,770
I came here first. Didn't I?

291
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,790
Are you done?

292
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,860
As long as you two shut up,

293
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,980
I'll be done.

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,700
Zhong Wei.

295
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,780
Chen Miren has broken up with you.

296
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,240
Please keep your distance.

297
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,460
Don't make trouble.

298
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,950
Who is he?

299
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,570
We didn't break up.

300
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
We're just having a cold war, right?

301
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,290
Come with me.

302
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,330
Where are we going?

303
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,990
Go away.

304
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,110
Where are we going?

305
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,090
Aren't you childish?

306
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,550
I'm not as childish as you.

307
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,630
You asked someone to act with you

308
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,890
to persuade me to quit.

309
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,990
You should at least rehearse.

310
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,410
He's so bad at acting.

311
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,740
How can I get into the role?

312
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,940
Can't you be reasonable?

313
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,820
Be reasonable?

314
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,530
When two people in a relationship are arguing,

315
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,730
how can they can be reasonable?

316
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,640
We didn't just fight. We broke up.

317
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,770
Zhong Wei.

318
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,510
I'll tell you again.

319
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,890
We've broken up.

320
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,430
You announced it unilaterally.

321
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,230
Did I admit it?

322
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,400
I don't want to talk to you.

323
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,640
It's fine.

324
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,700
Let me talk to you.

325
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,940
You didn't study hard in class.

326
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,910
You read for leisure during class.

327
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,400
You looked up four times in ten minutes

328
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,350
and played with your phone eight times.

329
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,800
You even spent three minutes drawing on the textbook.

330
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,740
Don't think that just because the teacher praised you,

331
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,750
you can become careless and proud.

332
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,570
Listen.

333
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,510
Without me by your side,

334
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,830
and tutoring you,

335
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,710
and you fail,

336
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,080
you'll regret it too late.

337
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,900
It's none of your business.

338
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,830
Of course, it is.

339
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,790
Think about it.

340
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,560
