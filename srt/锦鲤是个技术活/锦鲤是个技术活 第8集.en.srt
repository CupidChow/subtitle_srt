The first place goes to Zhong Wei.

7
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,539
He obtained a perfect score of 100.

8
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,420
What? 100?

9
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,020
That's just insane!

Yeah.

12

The second place goes to Zhao Gu.

13

Zhao Gu, you got second place.

I won't disclose the specific score here.

26
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,699
you wouldn't have ended up with the lowest score.

27
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,460
If you don't put in more effort,

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,080
you might as well expect to fail the final exam.

Zhong Wei, you really are a genius.

38
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,200
The summary is very accurate.

39

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,830
Chen Miren,

336
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,810
when did you start to like me?

337
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,610
Maybe…

338
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,220
It all starts from drawing the poster…

339
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,830
Really?

340
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,830
But why don't I know?

341
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,250
It's true.

342
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,860
I even brought that cardboard cutout

343
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,790
back to the dorm.

344
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,750
I can't sleep

345
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,850
without looking at it every night.

346
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,170
So,

347
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,380
that cardboard cutout

348
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,700
is our token of love.

349
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,890
Yes.

350
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,630
Then give it to me.

351
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,660
You look at yourself every day,

352
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,240
isn't that weird?

353
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,620
You drew it.

354
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,950
How could it be awkward?

355
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,050
Chen Miren,

356
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,840
did you throw away the human-shaped sign?

357
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,670
Of course not.

358
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,630
I just leave it in the dorm.

359
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,720
I'll move it to your room another day.

360
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay.

361
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Why are your hands sweating so much?

362
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm hot. I'm hot.

363
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,330
Let's go.

364
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,300
Chen Miren,

365
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,820
why did you come back so late?

366
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,020
Wasn't it over early?

367
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,990
How would you know? You didn't go.

368
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,000
I bumped into Bao Jiaguo.

369
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,610
Ren.

370
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,580
I suspect Bao Guoguo is following me.

371
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,680
Why do you say that?

372
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,420
I ran five laps on the playground today.

373
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,570
And he knew about it.

374
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,000
It doesn't prove anything.

375
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,920
Maybe he just bumped into you.

376
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,390
Actually, I think

377
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,300
Bao Jiaguo is not a bad guy,

378
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,090
he just has a bit of a creepy vibe.

379
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,790
You've read too many novels.

380
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,870
This is reality,

381
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,960
there aren't that many drama queens.

382
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,390
Why are you trying on clothes in the middle of the night?

383
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,910
Tomorrow,

384
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,200
I have an interview at Heng Chang.

385
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,780
You're so outstanding. You'll nail it.

386
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
I'll do my best.

Isn't this too fancy?

Surprising them

391

is the way to impress the interviewer.

392

Yes, is there a problem?

That might be an oversight on our HR department's part.

What did you design?

440
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,970
The style is too conservative.

441
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,750
The incorporation of technological elements isn't thorough enough.

442
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,380
It doesn't look like a future era.

443
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,240
It looks more like a clown

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,730
Then make it two.

508
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,710
You look so happy today.

509
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,940
Zhong Wei, I passed the interview at Heng Chang.

510
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,630
Really?

511
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,340
Boss, I'd like a supreme luxury strawberry sundae.

512
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,850
I knew

513
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,530
you would pass the interview.

514
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,760
I should thank you

515
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,740
for not sending the video

516
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,010
to Heng Chang HR.

517
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,700
Chen Miren, are you stupid?

518
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,960
How could I send the video

519
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
to Heng Chang HR?

520
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,550
You wouldn't do that?

521
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,190
I'm just trying to scare you.

522
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,550
I see.

523
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,790
You deliberately tried to get close to me at the beginning,

524
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,020
you wanted to be with me.

525
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,290
Hey, Chen Miren,

526
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,710
don't flatter yourself.

527
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,790
Your Matcha Bobo tea.

528
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,780
By the way, can I borrow your class notes?

529
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,680
Now you want to see my class notes?

530
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,710
My boyfriend is so excellent.

531
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,640
I can't waste it.

532
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,120
Of course.

533
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,280
Chen Miren.

534
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,470
You must pass the exam.

535
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,120
I don't want my girlfriend

536
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
to swim in front of the whole school.

537
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,680
So, let's date secretly before the exams.

538
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,800
I don't want to embarrass you.

539
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,530
Chen Miren, you dare to do this?

540
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,100
I don't dare, I don't dare.

541
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,270
How could I dare?

542
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,650
I can't go out with you during the holiday.

543
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,990
The shop needs renovation.

544
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,390
It's about to open.

545
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,270
What shop?

546
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,550
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

547
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,580
Alright, I'll start cramming Advanced Calculus

548
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,180
so you won't be embarrassed.

549
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,100
Hello.

550
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,680
Again?

551
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,610
Just cooperate with me.

552
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,940
Your dad wants to eat Thai food today.

553
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,090
You and dad showing off your relationship,

554
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,260
why do you always bring me into this?

555
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,920
As a member of this family,

556
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,420
you have the right to participate in every family event.

557
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,260
I abstain.

558
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,350
Then you have an obligation...

559
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,510
I refuse to fulfill it.

560
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,100
Well, next time you run out of money,

561
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,030
don't come to me.

562
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,670
I'm going to exchange it now.

563
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,280
Come on, hubby, taste my cooking.

564
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,160
It smells good.

565
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,760
Please.

566
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,620
Thank you.

567
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,770
Okay.

568
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,690
Muah!

569
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,470
Try this chicken.

570
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,940
This is so delicious.

571
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,080
It's so delicious, isn't it?

572
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,550
Yes.

573
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,370
Try one more.

574
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,080
It's delicious.

575
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,640
How is it? Is it good?

576
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,190
Yes.

577
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:15,540
Here.

578
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,680
Honey, you should try one, too.

579
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,170
Okay.

580
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,180
Thank you, hubby.

581
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,110
Try it.

582
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,550
It's so delicious.

583
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,570
Let me try it.

584
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,320
Okay.

585
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,560
Zhong Wei, where are you going?

586
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,020
I'll eat over there.

587
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,440
Thank you.

588
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,090
Leave him alone.

589
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,950
Don't eat anything.

590
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,030
Thank you, honey.

591
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,740
Eat more.

592
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,200
You too.

593
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,740
Thank you, honey.

[Zhong Wei]

595

[Zhong Wei]

596
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,890
How about Thai food tomorrow?

597
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,760
Playing too much is a waste of time.

598
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,140
I need to focus on studying.

599

[Chen Miren]

600
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,600
This is so fresh.

601

Try this one, too.

602
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,150
Let me do it myself.

603
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,300
Dad, mom, I'm full.

604
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,580
I'm going back to my room to study.

605
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,070
Did you hear what she said?

606
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,300
She's going to study.

607
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,940
She's just acting on a whim.

608
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,900
As long as the child is happy, it's fine.

609

Honey, you've worked hard.

610
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,940
Eat more.

611
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,310
Have a big chicken wing.

612
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,350
Try it.

613
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,510
Chen Miren,

Zhong Wei is so excellent.

615

You must work hard

616
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,900
to keep up with him.

617
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,030
It's just Adcanced Caculus.

618
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,410
You can do it.

It's holiday.

Why didn't you call me?

626

And I'll ask your dad to pick you up.

00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,520
Do you want some noodles?

679
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,179
No, thanks.

680
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,199
[Stories by the Bridge]

681
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,239
Thank you, sir.

682
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,679
Sir.

683
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,830
Calm down.

684
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,310
Calm down.

685
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,580
Is there anything worth mentioning?

686
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,020
We can't do this anymore.

687
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,840
Yes, we can't.

688
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,580
This...

689
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,310
Why?

690
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,950
The schedule is so tight.

691
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,150
Theoretically, we'd need at least eight workers.

692
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,790
But you,

693
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,280
to save on labor costs,

694
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,800
just decided to cut it in half.

695
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,910
From tiles and cement

696
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,190
to paint and screws,

697
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,340
you purchased them all by yourself.

698
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,200
You didn't have to be so ruthless.

699
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,410
I've seen many stingy bosses.

700
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,330
but someone as miserly as you,

701
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,560
this is my first time.

702
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,830
So,

703
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,060
if you don't pay us five times our salary for the National Holiday,

704
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,020
we'll quit.

705
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,340
Yes, we quit.

706
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,770
Five times?

707
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,270
Yes.

708
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,760
According to the national law,

709
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,950
holiday pay is triple.

710
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,910
I want five times.  Are you going to give it or not?

711
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,630
If not, we'll leave, we quit.

712
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,080
Let's go.

713
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,810
Let's go.

714
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,350
Sir.

715
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,150
Sir.

716
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,770
It's okay.

717
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,420
Just follow the contract.

718
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,260
They are the ones in breach,

719
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,990
they have to pay compensation.

720
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,290
By the way, hand over all the records

721
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,380
of material usage.

722
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,700
The cost of every brick and tile must be clear

723
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
and transparent.

724
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,810
Also,

725
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,880
they went on strike today,

726
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,210
delaying a day of work,

727
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,570
so their wages for today are all deducted.

728
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,630
OK.

729
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,740
Brothers, let's go.

730
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,220
Go.

731
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,190
Zhong Wei, if you fire all the workers now,

732
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,500
what about our work?

733
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,750
There are still two people.

734
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,800
We two?

735
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,180
You're right.

736
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,410
Let's move.

737
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:31,880
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
