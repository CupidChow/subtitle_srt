It's the first game of the basketball team recruitment.

He's quite vindictive.

517
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,020
How is it going?

518
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,080
Did your dad agree?

519
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,760
Zhao Gu.

520

Zhong Wei.

524

He has asked for a leave.

525
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,500
Zhong Wei set a good example for all of you.

526
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,780
He keeps learning on his day off.

527
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,320
So,

528
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,500
you should learn from him.

529
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,380
Why did Zhong Wei ask for leave?

530

Do you know?

531
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,540
He's sick.

Sick? What's the matter? Is it serious?

533

How is he now?

534
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,350
It's a disease of being stingy.

535
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,780
There's a big bucket of water on the table,

536
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,140
but I wasn't allowed to drink.

537

Why are you suddenly concerned about Zhong Wei?

540

I'm just asking.

541
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,240
I'm afraid the teacher

Don't forget to remind her.

550
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,300
If she's absent again,

551
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,030
she won't have enough credits.

552
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,470
Chen Miren, where is Xu Miaomiao?

553
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,560
She's sick. She's not feeling well.

554
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,560
Really?

555

Yes.

556
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,340
Ask Zhao Gu if you don't believe me.

557
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,020
Zhao Gu, I heard that Xu Miaomiao is sick?

Yes.

559

She's been lying in bed, reading unedifying novels online.

560
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,500
She was crying and laughing.

561
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,560
So she's badly ill.

Don't put it this way. It's an investment.

Is it my fault?

688
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,420
I just want to be alone.

689
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,930
Why do you keep bothering me?

690
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,440
You really broke up?

691
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,500
It's not a big deal.

692
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,620
Take it easy.

693
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,150
You two may not be destined in this life.

694
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,940
But in the next life,

695
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,700
you might be together.

Bao Jiaguo, what are you doing at this hour?

701
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,370
Heartbroken.

702

Painful.

Miserable.

704
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,300
Sorrowful.

705
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,530
I finally know

706
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,240
what a breakup is like.

What are you nagging about?

Fang Mao gave it to you?

Fang Mao

712
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,580
took me to a restaurant

713
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,790
that I really like.

714
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,050
We passed by a florist’s after dinner.

715
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,030
He insisted on buying me flowers.

I refused, but...

We don't have class tomorrow. Let's go watch a movie.

Or go on a picnic?
