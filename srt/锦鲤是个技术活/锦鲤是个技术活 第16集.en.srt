It depends.

For example, your mom

and your cousin who is in high school

29

193

That's ridiculous.

194

What's wrong?

195
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,220
Bao Zhendong, the new male lead,

196
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,210
is the new boyfriend of the heroine.

197
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,650
Originally, he would be by her side

198
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,160
whenever she is in need.

199
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,100
But now,

200
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,150
he told the heroine he was going to the company.

201
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,410
But he went into a strange hotel instead.

202
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,090
The male lead lied to the female lead.

203
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,670
The plot is going to collapse.

204
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,250
Now the key is

205
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,110
who the person in the room is.

206
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,930
I wonder

207
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
how A Caged Bird will write the plot.

208
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,430
But according to the plot development,

209
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,870
she is either a spy sent by the stepmother

210
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,660
or the male lead's first lover.

211
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,720
I think if you are together,

212
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,030
no matter what happens,

213
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,910
you shouldn't lie.

214
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,750
What if there's a reason?

215
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,190
Since you chose to lie,

216
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,720
it must be the best solution.

217
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,530
And the truth

218
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,910
is definitely much crueler than this.

219
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,980
I'd like to see

220
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,750
what the truth will be.

221

222

00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,310
There is a new movie

518
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,120
called Listen, Love Is Roaring.

519
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,360
I heard it's good.

520
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,489
Well,

521
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,210
let's go to the cinema near the campus.

522
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,190
It has the biggest and most comfortable seats.

523
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,170
And it offers more popcorn.

524
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
What do you think?

525
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:55,810
Chen Miren.

526
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,480
You don't want to go?

527
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,990
Or you don't want to go with me?

528
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,960
You know everything?

529
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,560
Should I keep pretending that I don't know?

530
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,200
Don't misunderstand me.

531
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,460
But it's all settled now.

532
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,210
Have you been with Cao Jia'er all this time?

533
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,820
Yes.

534
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,620
But she's going back to America soon.

535
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,290
I just want...

536
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,350
We should break up.

537
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,860
Chen Miren,

538
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,010
say it again!

539
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,720
Zhong Wei,

540
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,450
now you know

541
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,180
I'm a fake.

542
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,340
I knew you got the wrong person long ago.

543
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,910
I've been lying to you

544
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,280
to be with you.

545
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,110
I don't mind.

546
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,140
I do.

547
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,240
Being with you is too stressful.

548
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,930
I feel like a thief

549
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,310
taking someone else's place

550
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,240
and stealing someone else's love.

551
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,110
But now it's good.

552
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,640
Cao Jia'er is back.

553
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,630
I can give you back to her.

554
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,230
You think I'm something

555
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,840
that you can just give back?

556
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,250
Sorry.

557
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,150
I used wrong words.

558
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,080
Can we break up?

559
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,780
No.

560
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,370
You won't break up with me,

561
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,110
but you went on a date with Cao Jia'er.

562
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,230
Do you want to be a two-timer?

563
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,360
What do you mean?

564
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,790
Am I that kind of person to you?

565
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,750
Aren't you?

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,110
If I wanted to be a two-timer,

567
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,020
I wouldn't have waited until now.

568
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,660
Right.

569
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,860
You are popular.

570
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,050
You can have many girlfriends.

571
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,420
I don't deserve you.

572
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,030
Why are you talking about that again?

573
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,530
Can you let me finish?

574
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,810
Why are you so unreasonable now?

575
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,070
Now you know.

576
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,920
It's not too late.

577
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,530
Chen Miren,

578
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,680
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

579
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,990
If you break up with me this time,

580
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,450
I won't wait for you again.

581
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,510
Don't regret it.

582
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,030
I don't.

583
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
I don't want you anymore!

584
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,870
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
