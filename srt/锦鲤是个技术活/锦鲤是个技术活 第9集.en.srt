Yes, I'm in Director Yu's department.

Why did you make this bad decision?

00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,540
Why did you go to their department?

529

If she doesn't go to the top project team

does that mean she has to go to your team

that ranks the lowest every year?

I've figured out the whole activity procedure.

play games with them

643
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,640
and...

644
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,310
I refuse.

645
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,150
Why?

646
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,780
I have a girlfriend.

647
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,190
It's for work, Chen Miren will understand.

648
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,000
She doesn't understand or need to understand.

649
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,400
By the way, when I went to the company today,

650
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,330
I met Chen Miren.

651
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,310
And then?

652
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,680
Of course I cooperated with your act.

653
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,910
I told her

654
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,670
you are a temporary staff I recruited.

655
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,400
What act did you cooperate with?

656
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,220
I think Chen Miren doesn't care

657
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,060
whether I'm rich or not.

658
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,020
I think

659
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,110
she's caring about me. That's cute.

660
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,330
Okay, I know.

661
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,980
Let nature take its course.

662
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,239
Yes, let it be.

663
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,080
Are you free tomorrow?

664
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,420
Was it because you planned to let Chen Miren

665
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,739
attend the opening tomorrow,

666
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,199
so you refused to take photos with your fans?

667
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm busy. I'm not free tomorrow.

668
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,260
Is she not coming tomorrow?

669
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,580
Can you agree to take photos now?

670
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,440
I won't take any photos no matter if she comes or not.

671
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,040
Okay, I'm leaving.

672
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,699
Where are you going?

673
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,739
I'm going back to work overtime

674
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,489
and make another plan.

675
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,560
OHH is a mysterious code.

676
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,510
After translating it, it means "stay by my side."

677
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,500
OHH's purpose is to create

678
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,030
a brand new kingdom of figurines

679
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,700
with the theme of companionship and guardianship.

680
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,410
Our main product is this Companion Cat.

681
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,980
It's the first time we use self-heating material.

682
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,210
Once it comes into contact with the human body,

683
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,010
it will emit a little warmth.

684
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,930
So this figure is no longer

685
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,780
just a lifeless item in collections and decorations

686
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,350
but a friend

687
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,500
who brings people company and warmth.

688
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,390
Please line up.

689
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,220
The first ten to order

690
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,840
will be given an autographed photo of the handsome shop manager.

691
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,070
I want it!

692
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,120
Hurry up.

693
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,990
Me too.

694
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:01,850
Hurry up.

695
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,400
[OHH]

696
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,630
I want it too.

697
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,120
I...

698
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,200
I want one too.

699
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,940
I want one.

700
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,940
[Congratulations on the opening of OHH]

701
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,300
Me too. Anyone else?

702
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,200
Is there a spot for me?

703
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,690
What's going on?

704
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,060
You're the manager,

705
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,240
of course it's yours.

706
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,450
You didn't want to take pictures with your fans.

707
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,710
I could only change to another strategy.

708
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,030
Not too bad.

709
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,730
Then who signed it?

710
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,100
Me.

711
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,820
Look how popular it is.

712
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,140
[Congratulations on the opening of OHH]

713
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,690
Very nice.
