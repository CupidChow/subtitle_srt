The size of the platform is not the key.

239
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,280
The key is

240
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,640
whether we can create

241
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,460

242

Atmosphere?

243
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,640
Market research shows

244
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
the atmosphere greatly affects

the consumers' online shopping decisions.

246
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,300

with strong shopping atmosphere

249
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,380
it can motivate consumers

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,900
What?

253
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,340
The reason why the Companion Cat is selling well in OHH

254
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,480
but the sales are poor on the distributors' side

255
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,560
is because OHH

256
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,230
provides a good shopping experience and atmosphere.

257
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,520

the same kind of shopping atmosphere on the Internet,

259

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,780
[Companion Cat]

346
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,820
[Companion Cat Annual Sales Champion]

347
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,600
We won.

348
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,620
I almost forgot.

349
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,050
Director Yu,

350
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,030
you colluded

351
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,540
with the distributors

352
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,780
to submit fake declarations

353
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,880
and to return the products as competitive tactics.

354
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,030
You have violated the company's rules.

355
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,840
The company will hold you accountable.

356
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,160
Let's go back and tell them.

357
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,960
How did it go?

358
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,940
We won.

359
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,710
We won!

360
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,369
Great!

361
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,230
Let me tell you.

362
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,570
This is thanks to all of you.

363
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,170
We've prepared two plans...

364
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,590
[Heng Chang]

365
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,350
Are you the designer of the Companion Cat?

366
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,680
Yes.

367
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,620
No wonder you understand the profound meaning

368
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,080
of companionship so well.

369
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,210
Have I seen you somewhere before?

370
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,090
No, I don't think so.

371
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,170
Mr. Zhong, you got it wrong.

372
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,360
Is he handsome?

373
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,890
Just so so.

374
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,110
I remember now.

375
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,440
Just so-so.

376
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,930
What did my dad say?

377
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,680
Who knows?

378
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,690
You've been here for around eight years, right?

379
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,980
8 years and 6 months.

380
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,610
Do you know

381
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,970
what Heng Chang relied on to establish itself in the industry?

382
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,160
Heng Chang has the greatest capital

383
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,830
and top designers in the country.

384
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,660
It has a broad sales network

385
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,380
throughout Asia and China,

386
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,060
which formed a competitive barrier.

387
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,800
What else?

388
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,910
Isn't that enough?

389
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,070
The company has come this far

390
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,450
and became the leading enterprise in this industry

391
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,050
due to its innovative spirit.

392
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,110
It relies on collective creativity.

393
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,950
Excuse me.

394
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,730
Is there any difference?

395
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,280
Dawei.

396
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,300
You’re stubborn

397
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,430
and rigid,

398
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,110
and also believe in the policy of elimination

399
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,800
which abolished our designers' imagination and creativity.

400
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,600
Even with the addition of Hirai,

401
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,770
he was unable to fulfill his role effectively.

402
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,250
You're not protecting the company,

403
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,620
but your personal authority.

404
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,720
Mr. Zhong,

405
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,450
you can't doubt my loyalty to the company.

406
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,400
I've never doubted that.

407
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,170
But now,

408
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,110
you are the one

409
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,730
who hurt the company.

410
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,620
At this point,

411
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,180
you don't have to be so grandiose.

412
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,120
You just wanted to protect Zhong Wei.

413
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,530
Have you ever thought

414
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,110
why you had the confidence to bet with Zhong Wei?

415
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,590
That's because you knew

416
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,390
even if you defeat Zhong Wei,

417
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,730
I won't target you because of that.

418
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,960
Heng Chang

419
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,950
never disapproves and even encourages competition.

420
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,520
Because competition

421
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,370
is better for innovation.

422
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,680
I won't take legal action against you

423
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,960
for changing the sales figures.

424
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
You should leave.

425
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,910
Take care.

426
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,580
Zhong Wei, hurry up.

427
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,030
The Japanese restaurant Mei booked

428
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,480
has a lot of customers during peak hours.

429
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,830
[Heng Chang]

430
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,440
Right away.

431
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,860
Congratulations, Zhong Wei.

432
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,830
Thank you.

433
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,120
I lost to you.

434
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,900
You didn't lose to me

435
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,250
but to our team.

436
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,420
Let's go.

437
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:20,980
Let's go.

438
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,360
[Heng Chang]

439
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,860
Her idea was really great.

440
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,080
I really didn't expect it.

441
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,710
Yes.

442
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,470
Mom.

443
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,990
You're back.

444
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,200
I have good news for you.

445
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,230
What is it?

446
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,840
My psychological diagnosis is out.

447
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,580
The doctor said I've recovered.

448
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,470
I don't need to take medicine anymore.

449
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,050
That's great, Mao.

450
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,880
I'm so happy.

451
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,410
I've already told the teacher.

452
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,870
I can go to class tomorrow.

453
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,270
Okay.

454
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,040
I'll cook something delicious.

455
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,470
Let's celebrate.

456
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,900
Okay.

457
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,600
Auntie, let me help you.

458
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,290
Okay.

459
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,720
Luo Si.

460
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,170
Let's go.

461
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,730
Luo Si?

462
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,040
We're going to be late.

463
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,290
Luo Si.

464
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,370
Luo Si.

465
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,000
Luo Si.

466
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,290
Luo Si.

467
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,440
What are you doing?

468
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,010
You've recovered.

469
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,010
I should move back to the dorm.

470
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,330
Right.

471
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,370
My home is too far from your school.

472
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,310
It's not convenient for you to go to class.

473
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,170
Let me help you.

474
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,970
Go back, Fang Mao.

475
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,850
It's okay,

476
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,870
or

477
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,210
you don't want to go to class?

478
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,330
I'll take you shopping,

479
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,020
hiking,

480
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,810
to the cinema

481
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,060
to watch your favorite romantic movie.

482
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,650
Fang Mao.

483
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,500
I also learned how to make

484
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,670
very delicious ribs recently.

485
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,830
I'll cook it for you tonight.

486
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,060
And...

487
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,710
Fang Mao.

488
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,860
Someone will accompany you to do these things.

489
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,080
But I just want to do them with you.

490
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,480
Fang Mao.

491
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,120
In the past,

492
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,170
I thought of you as my life.

493
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,050
All my emotions

494
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,180
were dependant on you.

495
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
I was happy as long as you were happy.

496
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,150
If you were sad, I would be sad too.

497
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,350
No.

498
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,000
I've become someone else.

499
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,060
I was an attachment to you.

500
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,390
I want to live for myself once.

501
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,890
Not for anyone, only for myself.

502
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,420
I don't love you anymore.

503
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,120
I took care of you and helped you

504
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,220
out of this crisis

505
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,350
because I still treat you as a friend.

506
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,740
I sincerely wish

507
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,760
you can find someone to spend the rest of your life with.

508
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,930
I also hope you can bless me

509
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,440
to start a new life, okay?

510
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,380
Luo Si.

511
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,980
Luo Si.

512
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,540
So beautiful.

513
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,070
Not bad.

514
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,630
That man is not good-looking.

515
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,780
He doesn't match the girl.

516
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,600
Stop looking.

517
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,320
I'm just taking a peek.

518
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,140
