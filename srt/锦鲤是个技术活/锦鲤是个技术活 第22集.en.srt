341
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,420
When I was with him,

342
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,180

the experimental report was lost.

345
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,750
He did redo it.

But it was still awful.

His mentor

348
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,200
is Yao Weijing's father

349
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,820
who scolded him badly.

350
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,950
Fang Mao.

351
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,520
You did a terrible job this time

352
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,050
on your experiment report.

353
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,530
You made mistakes

354
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,630
on such simple data.

355
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,890
What's wrong with you?

356
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,060
Jing said you broke up with her.

357
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,440
When Jing said she wanted to be with you,

358
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,550
I was against it

359
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,540
At that time,

360
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,400
you had a girlfriend named Luo Si.

361
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,650
I thought you were too disloyal to love.

362
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,970
If you treat that girl like that,

363
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,910
one day

364
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,430
you will treat Jing the same way.

365
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,060
Sir.

366
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,860
Can you stop?

367
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,670
We've been pampering Jing.

368
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,010
She's our precious daughter.

369
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,880
How dare you ask Jing to wash your clothes and cook for you?

370
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,820
You even asked Jing to order takeout for you.

371
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,510
What era is this?

372
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,680
Can any girl do this?

373
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,330
Can Luo Si do it?

374
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,480
Don't mention Luo Si.

375
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,450
Why do you mention Luo Si?

376
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,990
What do you want?

377
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,670
Luo Si is better.

378
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,620
Yao Weijing is nothing.

379
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,810
Due to his attack on the teacher,

380
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,310
he was given a school warning, and placed under school observation,

381
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,170
with all scholarships canceled.

382
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,990
Since then,

383
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,040
he has been like a different person.

384
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,500
He didn't contact anyone.

385
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,540
But when he mentioned me,

386
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,680
he seemed different.

The braised pork is really good.

398
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,180
Isn't it?

399
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,140
Not at all.

400
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,620
It's not half as good as that Luo Si made.

401
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,240
His mother had no choice

402
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,180
but to arrange a temporary leave of absence for him,

403
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,900
and brought him home to recuperate.

404
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,050
But his condition hasn't improved.

405
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,390
His mother also said

406
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,260
he wanted to see me.

407

410
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,910
Are you crazy?

411
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,960
He was the one who moved in with Yao Weijing behind your back.

412
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,340
He was also with the one who was with someone else suddenly.

413
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,230
Now you're going to take care of him.

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,110
And then?

415

416
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,680
No.

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,300
is with Yao Weijing happily,

420
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,060
I would curse him every day.

421
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,080
But not he's like this.

422

At least I hope he can be healthy.

The treatment period of anxiety is long.

427

He needs long-term psychotherapy

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,390
1,000 pieces have been sold out.

520
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,890
I ordered from Mr. Wang

521
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,380
2,000 more pieces.

522
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,960
Chen Miren.

523
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,350
You're enjoying success in both your career and love life!

524
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,380
You are good too.

525
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,410
Bao Jiaguo and you

526
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,720
are so lovey-dovey.

527
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,990
We are so jealous.

528
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,540
Bao Jiaguo

529
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
is writing his new novel.

530
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,090
It's about an inspiring heroine.

531
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,450
The heroine is based on me.

532
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,350
A heroine based on you?

533
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,890
It's not easy for A Caged Bird.

534
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,590
Dating a straightforward girl like Miaomiao

535
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,540
is not easy for Bao Jiaguo.

536
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,290
What do you mean?

537
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,110
How am I being straightforward?

538
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,010
But Bao Jiaguo is also a straightforward boy.

539
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,100
We are a good match.

540
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,660
So you knew.

541
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,660
Luo Si.

542
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,670
It's okay.

543
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,470
I've thought it through.

544
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,070
I won't get lost in love again.

545
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,460
I won't take my boyfriend

546
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,740
as my only goal in life.

547
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,980
I want to build a new life goal.

548
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,290
What is your new goal?

549
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,230
I haven't had one yet.

550
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,830
It's okay.

551
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,920
Take your time.

552
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,180
Yes, we have plenty of time.

553
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,130
Take your time.

554
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,870
Cheers.

555
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,940
Cheers.

556
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,860
Let me try yours.

557
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,270
Is it good?

558
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,930
Yes.

559
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,580
Let me do it.

560
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,570
Mao, open the door.

561
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,770
Leave me alone! Go away!

562
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,700
Fang Mao.

563
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,670
Open the door.

564
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,670
A general trend of future economic development

565
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,340
is that the individuals will be empowered.

566
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,950
The global middle class will rise strongly,

567
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,700
and women's abilities will be stronger and stronger.

568
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,100
At the same time,

569
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,980
the demand of the middle class is getting higher and higher.

570
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,240
No government

571
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,730
can meet them,

572
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,610
resulting in an expectation gap.

573
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,280
Harris.

574
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,900
It seems

575
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,310
you've found a girlfriend who is smarter than you.

576
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,160
This is a reason why I love her.

577
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,810
You said you study at Hanhai University, right?

578
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,040
Yes.

579
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,200
Why would such a smart person like yourself

580
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,210
choose to study

581
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,270
at such an ordinary school?

582
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,410
Hanhai University is one of the top universities in China.

583
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,370
No.

584
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,350
A top university should be like Oxford or Harvard.

585
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,810
As far as I know,

586
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,960
Hanhai University

587
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,270
is just a gathering place for a group of people

588
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,670
without a future.

589
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,780
I think your view is a little biased. Forgive me for disagreeing.

590
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,710
If you don't agree,

591
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,660
then why do you want to leave Hanhai

592
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,380
and go study in England?

593
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,110
Zhao Gu is a grateful person.

594
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,740
She loves her alma mater.

595
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,810
But baby,

596
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,960
why don't you

597
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,320
come with me to England?

598
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,260
Just leave all of your life here and come with me.

599
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,870
I can help you change your life.

600
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,730
I can be excellent on my own.

601
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,920
I believe being with Harris can help you

602
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,420
become

603
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,370
more excellent.

604
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,820
Congratulations on getting your exchange place in England.

605
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,360
Congratulations.

606
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,410
Congratulations.

607
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,360
Cheers.

608
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,800
Eat this.

609
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,590
This is delicious.

610
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,680
You too.

611
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,900
Eat more.

612
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,280
Auntie, here.

613
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,990
Have some soup.

614
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,370
You too.

615
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,070
Eat up.

623
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,080
Ever since you were in middle school,

[This is the taste]

625
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,130
you have always lived alone outside.

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,450
Our family

627
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,590
has never

628
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,300
taken good care of you since you were young.

629
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,980
All of a sudden, you're going

630
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,960
to such a faraway place.

631
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,450
I don't know if you'll get used to it

632
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,670
and if you'll be safe.

633
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,140
I have friends there. I'll be fine.

634

are not capable.

637

We can't help you much.

638
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,190
But when you are alone there,

639
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,940
remember,

640
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,900
don't fight with others.

641
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,100
You're not familiar with that place.

642
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,140
The less trouble,

643
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,280
the better.

644
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,240

Yes.

Okay, that's all.

647
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800

go to a faraway place.

we won't know.

Director,

671
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,200
we've already far exceeded other teams.

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,680
It's far less than I expected.

00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,100
I will process the return for you.

692
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,050
Thank you, Ms. Du.

693
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,040
Bye.

694
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:09,969
Mr. Li.

695
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,000
Zhong Wei.

696
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,070
It's okay.

697
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,590
There's still the fourth season.

698
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,650
We can work harder.

699
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:17,889
We'll make it.

700
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,260
This Boxing Duck...

701
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
It's Yi's work that was eliminated.

702
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,310
It was launched by Liu's team.

703
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,040
The sales are good.

704
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,719
The ones of mine that got eliminated

705
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,280
are much better than the Boxing Duck.

706
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Stop it.

707
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,460
Am I wrong?

708
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,940
He always goes his own way.

709
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,350
I quit.

710
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,340
Tan!

711
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,739
Tan.

712
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,310
Chao, I can’t do it anymore.

713
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,690
Chao, sorry.

714
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:48,540
You...

715
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,870
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
