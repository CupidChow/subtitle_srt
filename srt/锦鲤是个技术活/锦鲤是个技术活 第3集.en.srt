Chen Miren, how dare you touch my parcel?

365
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,060
I thought it was my parcel.

366
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:55,740
So I...

367
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,100
So you touched my stuff

368

No, I unwrapped the parcel.

371

We didn't mean it.

372
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,140
Besides,

373
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,849
Chen Miren apologized to you already.

374
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,000
Then please don't touch my stuff

375

without my permission from now on.

376

It's just a bed sheet and quilt cover.

Must you act like this?

378

Zhao Gu.

379
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,859
Zhao Gu, what are you acting up for?

380
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,990
It's a misunderstanding.

381
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,079
It's cleared up now.

382
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,940
Don't be angry.

No.

What style?

391
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,680
The type that looks cold as ice

Zhong Wei!

686
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,500
Send him to the infirmary.

687
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,120
Okay.

688
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,370
It's just an apology.

689
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,520
[Ward 1]

690
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,730
What's so hard about it?

691
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,380
Ask Chen Miren to apologize to Zhong Wei.

692
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,460
I won't betray my friend.

693
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,870
Didn't you see Zhong Wei's expression?

694
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,900
If Chen Miren is here,

695
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,630
Zhong Wei might tear her apart.

696
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,530
Forget it. Let's go.

697
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,650
[Treatment Room]

698
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,880
[Treatment Room] [Nurse Station] [Ward 1]

699
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,070
I heard Zhong Wei's allergy reaction to pollen was very serious.

700
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,730
I'm familiar with allergies.

701
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,430
I was allergic to mango when I was young,

702
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,000
but I loved eating mango.

703
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,340
I always ate them

704
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,260
when my parents were not paying attention.

705
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,760
It was okay if I ate a little.

706
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,730
But one time,

707
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,140
I ate eight at once

708
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,930
and went into shock. I had to be rushed to the hospital.

709
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,670
Yes.

710
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,060
The school doctor also said

711
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,980
there were too much pollen this time.

712
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,130
Who would have thought

713
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,530
that so many people would give him flowers.

714
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,650
[Zhong Wei]

715
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,520
Are you feeling better?

716
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,110
I didn't know you were allergic to pollen.

717
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,530
See you in the woods at 10 tomorrow.

718
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,670
Zhong Wei.

719
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,240
Chen Miren.

720
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,210
You asked those girls to send me flowers, didn't you?

721
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,940
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

722
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
I didn't know it would be so serious.

723
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,240
I've deleted the video.

724
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,470
Chen Miren.

725
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,860
We're even now.

726
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,210
You don't have to force yourself anymore.

727
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:55,740
Zhong...

728
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,870
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
