Zhong Wei, answer this question.

6
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,930
Sir, Zhong Wei has asked for a leave.

7
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,930
Okay.

8
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,759
Zhao Gu, answer this question.

9
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,620
In terms of the transportation problem...

10
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,870
I've heard that Zhong Wei

11
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,289
is seriously ill this time.

12
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,630
He can't even get off the bed.

13
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,080
He even needs two people to help him to go to the toilet.

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,220
It's just an allergy.

15
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,820
He's not that seriously ill.

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,470
A boy from a rich family like him is delicate.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,180
He could even have a concussion after sneezing.

18
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,440
Chen Miren,

19
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,150
you've become the foe of girls

20
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,210
all over the school who killed their husband this time.

21
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,560
Thank you.

22
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,230
The chain is broken again?

23
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,740
Yes.

24
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,400
It's an old problem.

25
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,420
How did you know?

26
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,050
I know everything about you.

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,570
What did you say?

28
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,829
Nothing.

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,579
What is this?

30
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,590
Someone gave it to me.

31
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,260
Why don't you open it and read it?

32
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,270
No.

33
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,180
I'm not interested in her.

34
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,470
I won't waste the time.

35
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,930
Well...

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,670
There were no books on this seat.

37
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,260
There were also no other signs showing that

38
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,880
someone had occupied this seat.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,210
So, theoretically,

40
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,170
I've found this seat first.

41
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,980
If you want to tell me

42
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,940
you've occupied this seat

44
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,170

45

but I won't give in.

46

I wanted to tell you that

47

You don't sleep in the middle of the night,

and you came to the grove instead?

If I had not stayed up till the middle of the night

81

This is the first work in my life

85
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,790
which is shown to the public.

86
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,540

I advise you not to overestimate yourself.

For you and me, the shcool punk

and the campus belle

91
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,670
can only be observed from afar and can't be trifled with.

92

You should learn from me.

Otherwise, you'll be the only one who gets hurt.

So, you came to the grove to wait for Xu Miaomiao?

Huang Xiaoyue, you're a pervert!

You are the pervert!

99
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,440
This is an important workplace for me.

100
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,140
The grove is an important source of gossip.

101
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,260
What do you know?

102
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,730
Do you think if Xu Miaomiao has a date,

103
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,360
she would come to the grove?

104
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,020
You're right.

105
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,160
For a beauty like Xu Miaomiao,

106
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,720
it's a bit inappropriate to go into the grove.

107
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,240
The grove is only suitable for ordinary students,

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,640

Zhao Gu!

110
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,060
What a coincidence.

Are they your classmates?

We're not quite close.

Wait.

115
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,610
Why did we run away?

116
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,470
I have a conflict with Zhao Gu.

117
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,860
It's too embarrassing to meet her.

118
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,440
Why are you embarrassed?

119
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,850
They should be the ones who feel embarrassed.

120
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,500
When this top student is in love,

121
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
she's so wild.

One box.

Well...

It's the first work in my life which is shown to the public.

I've brought it back so as to keep is as a memento.

140
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,090
You might as well sell it on Goofish.

141
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,110
Maybe you can sell it at a good price.

142
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,050
Good idea. I'll post the sales information at once.

143
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,190
I was merely saying it. You take it seriously?

144
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,180
I knew it.

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,770
It's my first work, and is very memorable.

146
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,330
I should keep it.

Chen Miren.

148
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,810
You can put it in the dorm,

149
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,520
but can you not put Zhong Wei's face towards me?

150
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,980
I feel uncomfortable.

Miaomiao.

152
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,270
If someone comes to see you every day,

153
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,710
you think he's annoying,

154
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,200
but if he doesn't come to see you,

155
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,880
you would be a little disappointed.

156
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,430
What do you think is the reason?

157
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,400
Are you talking about Huang Xiaoyue?

158
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,200
Of course not.

159
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,370
Almost like that.

160
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,890
It must be because you like him.

161
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,120
Let me tell you.

162
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,780
When I was in high school,

163
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,990
a boy liked me,

164
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,600
and he followed me for three years.

165
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,100
He went wherever I went.

166
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,830
He bought me water, milk tea and snacks.

167
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,920
He even brought me a pillow as I would sleep in class.

168
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,660
What happened later?

169
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Was there a story?

170
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,460
Nothing happened after that.

171
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,970
He wasn't admitted to Hanhai University. I wasn't disappointed, either.

172
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,430
Because I didn't like him.

173

It's all right that he's gone.

174

Miaomiao, hearing what you said,

175
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,620
why do I feel that you're a little bad?

176
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,320
It seems I'm a bad girl.

177
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,320
But I can afford to be bad.

178

Congratulations, future design master.

But it says

185

Thank you so much.

To be honest,

197
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,230
I had been the seeded player of the school

I won the first prize for three years in a row.

201

into a photo album, and have sent it to the class chat group.

This is the first group activity of our class.

Zhong Wei, I have a piece of good news

Whatever.

216
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
The good news is that

the project of Self-heating Companion Cats

218
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,370
has been approved in the company's assessment meeting.

What about the bad news?

220
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,450
The company cut our budget.

221
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,320
They only allowed us to make 20,000 pieces.

20,000 pieces?

223
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,340
For this, it even took me a long time to persuade

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,830
♫He's still there when I turn around♫

675
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,740
♫So this is the kindness after he saw through me♫

676
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,850
♫He used his warm hands♫

677
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,480
♫To melt my face which longs for being loved♫

678
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,870
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
