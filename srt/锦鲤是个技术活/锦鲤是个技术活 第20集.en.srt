00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,320
She took all the

178
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,140
fireworks and candles I bought.

179
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,140
Chen Miren.

180
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,960
What were you gonna say just now?

181
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,100
Nothing.

182
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,300
I just wanted to say

183
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,580
if you came back early,

184
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,530
there would be no surprise.

185
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,240
I have to say

186
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,630
this is the most unsuccessful surprise I've ever seen.

187
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,380
However,

188
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,820
it's my happiest birthday.

189
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,320
Thank you.

190
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,110
Do you want me to sing the birthday song on my own?

191
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,300
Come on.

192
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,350
Let's sing the birthday song.

193
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,070
Happy birthday to you.

194
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,540
Happy birthday to you.

195
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,340
Happy birthday to you.

196
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,740
Happy birthday to you.

197
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,700
Make a wish.

198
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,300
Happy birthday.

199
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,180
[Happy birthday]

200
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,020
Zhao Gu.

201
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,190
Your boyfriend is so generous.

202
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,820
I hope my boyfriend

203
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,710
can celebrate my birthday for me.

204
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,000
Both of us are busy.

205
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,830
That's right.

206
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,870
Her boyfriend

207
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,020
is a professor

208
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,260
and runs a company.

209
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,340
He's doing business,

210
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,300
not for fun.

211
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,220
He's good to me.

212
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,900
He promised me

213
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,460
to pay for my tuition and accommodation while studying abroad.

214
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,130
Also,

215
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,120
his friend is an executive of a top 500 enterprise.

216
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,170
After my graduation,

217
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,310
I'll join his friend's company.

218
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,580
Zhao Gu,

219
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,480
you've decided to study abroad?

220
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,340
Yes.

221
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,280
The application for exchange students has been submitted.

222
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,630
I'll leave

223
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,880
when it's approved.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,080
So soon?

225
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,060
Zhao Gu.

226
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
I think you can wait.

227
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,850
Going abroad is not a small matter.

228
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,990
Besides, you only know Harris

229
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,340
abroad.

230
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,180
What if, I mean, just in case,

231
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,310
he's not as honest as he seems?

232
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,260
Chen Miren.

233
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,760
Do you know anything?

234
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,620
Just some common hypotheses.

235
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,870
Foreigners are open-minded.

236
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,030
Chen Miren.

237
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,800
Don't scare her.

238
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,520
Tell us if you know anything.

239
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,820
Zhao Gu is going abroad soon.

240
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,570
Don't let her suffer abroad.

241
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,270
Don't scare her

242
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,390
if there's no hard evidence.

243
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,750
Let her leave happily.

244
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,800
Miaomiao is right.

245
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,330
Just give it to us straight.

246
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,990
A friend told me

247
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,180
Harris was not

248
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,020
as he appeared to be.

249
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,130
He's frivolous and casual.

250
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,440
He's... He's a scumbag.

251
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,460
What?

252
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,940
That’s what I figure.

253
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,250
But I don't mind.

254
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,900
You don't mind?

255
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,270
We just get what we need.

256
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,120
It doesn't matter to me

257
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,730
if he's serious about our relationship.

258
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,240
Who wants the first piece?

259
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,100
Zhao Gu.

260
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,250
Have you ever

261
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,730
liked Harris?

262
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,770
No.

263
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,130
All I want is his connections

264
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,430
and economic capability.

265
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,090
I don't care about other things.

266
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,150
It doesn't matter.

267
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,280
Are you happy

268
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,670
to be with someone you don't like?

269
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,710
Besides,

270
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,250
what if

271
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,640
he abandons you

272
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,780
when you're in Britain?

273
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,740
Zhao Gu,

274
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,460
you shouldn't have taken love as your springboard,

275
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,630
or sacrificed your happiness

276
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,040
for your career.

277
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,190
What is happiness?

278
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,200
I have no idea.

279
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,840
I'm different from you.

280
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,540
Your parents love you very much.

281
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,480
They can provide you with good financial condition

282
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,660
for you to go to college.

283
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,880
They can even arrange a bright future for you.

284
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,220
What about mine?

285
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,750
They only care about my younger brother.

286
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,840
I had to pay for

287
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,480
all my tuition and living expenses in college.

288
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,880
How can I

289
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,320
live better than yesterday

290
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,950
is what I have to think about every day.

291
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,490
So you have no right to criticize me

292
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,720
or teach me how to do it.

293
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,980
Happy birthday to you.

294
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,450
[Happy birthday to you]

295
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,280
[Happy birthday to you]

296
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,380
It's my birthday cake.

297
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,620
I want to blow the candle out by myself.

298
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,880
What's wrong with you?

299
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,880
[Happy birthday]

300
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,570
What’s wrong with your brother blowing out the candle?

301
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,620
Zhi, don't be sad.

302
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Come on.

303
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,180
Come here.

304
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,300
Have your favorite strawberries.

305
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,840
I don't want to celebrate my birthday anymore.

306
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,290
[Happy birthday]

307
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,850
Anger is a tiring thing.

308
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,540
You must be hungry.

309
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,700
Just have some.

310
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,980
You can be angry with us

311
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,520
when you're full.

312
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,640
Yes.

313
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,850
Don't be too touched.

314
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,310
I just bought it on the fly.

315
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,860
You look gorgeous

316
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,890
in this color.

317
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,680
Zhao Gu,

318
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,160
I made this purse myself.

319
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,750
There's a talisman inside.

320
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,010
I got it from a temple.

321
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,680
I hope everything goes well for you

322
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,120
and you can realize your dream.

323
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,880
Zhao Gu,

324
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,660
I don't know what to give you.

325
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,300
These notebooks

326
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,830
were bought online.

327
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,990
If you take notes on these lovely notebooks,

328
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,920
you'll be more energetic to study.

329
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,560
And this pen.

330
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,700
It can be used as a lipstick, too.

331
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,670
Chen Miren.

332
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,280
You're ruining the atmosphere, you know?

333
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,030
Thank you.

334
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,210
I was overreacted

335
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,290
just now.

336
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,510
But I believe in my choice.

337
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
I don't expect you to understand me.

338
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,170
As long as you trust me.

339
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,240
I can be responsible for my life

340
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,620
and my choice.

341
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,330
Zhao Gu,

342
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,650
no matter what happens,

343
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,630
Room 608

344
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,840
will always be your strongest support.

345
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
Yes, the strongest support.

346
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,940
Let's sing a birthday song together.

347
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,700
OK. Come on.

348
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,030
Three, two, one.

349
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,070
Happy birthday to you.

350

Is this the worst club in our school?

360
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,490
Due to the poor attendance,

361
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,670
it was underfunded and on the verge of being disbanded.

I heard they were selling props.

I have a question for you.

393

Why did you leave without saying goodbye back then?

394
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,810
Because

395

That ugly girl in red,

523
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,000
throw the ball to me.

524
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,960
Xu Miaomiao, are you okay?

525
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,930
I'll buy it for you.

526
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,260
Wait for me.

527
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,640
Hello?

528
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,070
Bao Jiaguo.

529
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,040
Did you receive the flowers?

530
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,790
Yes.

531
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,380
Do you like them?

532
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,460
Yes.

533
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,170
That's good.

534
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,780
So tonight,

535
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,420
will Lin Miaomiao receive

536
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,140
999 Louis XIV roses

537
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,290
sent by Bao Zhendong

538
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,780
from France?

539
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,180
A Caged Bird?

540
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,570
You know everything?

541
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,460
Xu Miaomiao.

542
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,460
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

543
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,250
Bao Jiaguo.

544
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,790
No.

545
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,840
A Caged Bird.

546
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,380
You are so dedicated.

547
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,880
You did anything

548
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,450
to find inspiration, right?

549
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,010
What inspiration?

550
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,280
No wonder you were aloof to me

551
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,420
from time to time.

552
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,660
You're using me as your writing resource, aren't you?

553
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,700
Let me explain.

554
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm not...

555
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,040
Hello?

556
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,570
Hello?

557
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,440
Scumbag!

558
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,830
Miaomiao.

559
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,290
It seems

560
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,150
this is more complicated than we've thought.

561
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,170
Am I not supposed to tell her?

562
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,110
Miaomiao.

563
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,970
From what I know about Bao Jiaguo,

564
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,300
there's definitely a misunderstanding.

565
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Maybe

566
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,140
he wanted to give you a surprise.

567
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,270
Look.

568
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,660
When the novel's all over,

569
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,900
he would suddenly give you a confession of love

570
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,420
with your real names.

571
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,640
Isn't that romantic?

572
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,480
It's more than romantic.

573
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,250
Bao Jiaguo keeps updating his novel

574
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,060
for years.

575
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,700
He never suspends his novel.

576
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,670
For his persistence,

577
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,690
he's better than

578
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,170
80% of men you've ever met.

579
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
Let me explain to you.

580
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,600
Firstly,

581
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,050
he has the perseverance

582
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,770
that is required by every job.

583
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,670
Secondly,

584
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,940
he's less likely

585
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,200
to be fickle in affection

586
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,040
than other boys.

587
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,060
I know what to do.

588
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,340
You don't have to tell me this.

589
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,560
What are you thinking?

590
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:49,990
Zhong Wei.

591
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,070
Zhong Wei?

592
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,220
Have you noticed

593
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,450
after he broke up with Chen Miren,

594
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,680
he has become the messenger of bad news.

595
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,830
First, it was related to Zhao Gu.

596
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,990
He exposed Harris's scandal.

597
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,380
And then it's me.

598
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,060
I and Bao Jiaguo couldn't be together because of him.

599
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,460
Who will be the next one?

600
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,000
Chen Miren!

601
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,140
Can you run away from Zhong Wei

602
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,670
when you see him?

603
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,240
Please.

604
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,350
Fang Mao and I

605
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,530
just want to win steadily.

606
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,220
To run away?

607
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,900
No one can escape from the bad news messenger.

608
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,990
[After you unfollow this account, you will no longer receive their message. ]

609
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,240
I always see you studying in the library recently.

610
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,910
Why?

611
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,760
It's too noisy in our dorm.

612
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,720
Why don't you move out?

613
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,080
I've considered it.

614
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,500
But the rent of the apartments near the school

615
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,410
is too high.

616
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,950
How about

617
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,540
moving in with me?

618
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,470
My roommate is about to move out.

619
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,820
Don't worry. The rent is not expensive.

620
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,220
It's inappropriate.

621
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,940
Yang.

622
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,540
Let me introduce you to each other.

623
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,530
This is my boyfriend.

624
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,190
This is Fang Mao.

625
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,870
Hello.

626
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,980
When do you have a boyfriend?

627
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't even know.

628
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,070
Why should I tell you?

629
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,380
Alright, I'm just kidding.

630
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,020
We're going to a movie.

631
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,570
Would you like to come with us?

632
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,670
No, thanks.

633
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,340
Okay, we're leaving.

634
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,040
Remember to consider sharing the flat with me.

635
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,750
To live together with Fang Mao,

636
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,160
you used me as your cover?

637
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,280
You have no idea!

638
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,510
I just wanted him to let his guard down.

639
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,520
I don't think Fang Mao is that good.

640
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,200
Why don't we be together?

641
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,280
Get lost. I like him very much.

642
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,100
He has a girlfriend, doesn't he?

643
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,310
He can break up with her.

644
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,830
[Are you there?]

645
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,830
[Please let me explain.]

646
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,860
Thank you.

647
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,750
I'm sorry.

648
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,280
It's not your fault.

649
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,530
It's my fault

650
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,690
to hide my identity.

651
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,320
But I guess

652
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,710
Chen Miren won't have any good impression of you.

653
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,910
What are you going to do next?

654
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,190
I will admit my mistake

655
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,010
and try to get leniency.

656
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,750
What about you?

657
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,710
I...

658
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,540
I'll try to make up for it.

659
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,110
I've got an astonishing gossip.

660
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,730
I have something to do. I gotta go.

661
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,900
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
