00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,530
Nothing.

176
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,590
I think it's a bit salty.

177
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,200
Go get a bottle of water.

178
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,160
No way.

179
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,830
I didn't add salt

180
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,090
[Son, I want to dye my hair. Which color is better?]

181
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,300
My aunt dyed her hair two days ago.

182
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,100
It was purple.

183
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,140
I think it's pretty.

184
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,020
It suits your mom.

185
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,140
She's about the same age.

186
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,730
Really?

187
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,290
Did you check my phone?

188
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,500
You can check mine, too.

189
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,680
I don't have that habit.

190
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,440
A couple shouldn't have secrets.

191
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,160
A couple should have their own space.

192
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,330
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm late.

194
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,800
It's okay.

195
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,580
Sit.

196
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,430
I'm good.

197
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,060
Zhong Wei.

198
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,990
Make a pose that you think is the most handsome.

199
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,970
Let's hurry up.

200
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,580
Creating a full-body poster

201
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,820
requires maintaining your posture.

202
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,930
Are you sure this is the pose you want?

203
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,950
Is this pose not cool?

204
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,430
It's cool, very cool.

205
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,800
This pose is…

206
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,860
Perfect.

207
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,500
You get so scared while watching the movie.

208
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,320
You're so bad.

209
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,620
Zhong Wei, smile.

210
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,800
I can't.

211
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,870
Let me tell you a joke.

212
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,190
Jasmine, rose, sunflower,

213
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,820
which flower is the weakest?

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,530
It's jasmine.

215
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,400
Because...

216
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,010
What a powerless jasmine.

217
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,190
Isn't it funny?

218
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,210
It's good not to laugh.

219
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,560
Wait.

220
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,620
Look.

221
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,930
The character ratio is wrong.

222
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,530
Redraw it.

223
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,010
What?

224
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,590
You decide on your poster.

225
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,200
This hairstyle is too ugly.

226
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,810
Redraw it.

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,930
Tose is not straight enough.

228
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,530
Redraw it.

229
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,210
Redraw it.

230
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:51,880
Redraw it.

231
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,530
Redraw it.

232
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,880
Lifeless eyes.

233
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,430
Redraw it.

234
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,240
Is it my fault?

235
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,830
It's not your fault; could it be mine then?

236
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,140
Besides,

237
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,220
my eyes are so big and so charming.

238
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,250
I can't see it.

239
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,270
Zhong Wei.

240
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,690
You're clearly taking this opportunity to get back at me

241
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,550
and torture me.

242
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,270
So you knew, huh?

243
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,540
Then have you ever considered

244
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,940
why I'm tormenting you or seeking revenge?

245
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,680
You reminded me.

246
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,230
Back when I transferred schools,

247
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,180
it was because

248
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,330
you're a grudge-holding, scheming, and stingy person.

249
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,290
Zhong Wei, this is just blatant revenge.

250
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,400
Kitty, are you hungry?

251
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,330
Why aren't you eating?

252
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,940
Have you ever seen a cat chewing on a big steamed bun?

253
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,050
Chen Miren,

254
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,940
Actually, you're good at drawing.

255
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,420
I just didn't expect that

256
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,430
the reason you left without a word

257
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,780
was because of this.

258
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,380
Actually, what I said earlier was just in the heat of the moment.

259
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,060
Really?

260
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,000
Chen Miren,

261
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,260
It's all in the past.

262
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,690
As for why you left without saying goodbye,

263
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,200
say nothing if you don't want to.

264
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,160
You really don't want to know?

265
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,720
It doesn't matter.

266
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,370
So you're not angry anymore?

267
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,990
No.

268
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,050
You'll let it go?

269
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,110
Yes.

270
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,340
You should have opened up about it sooner.

271
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,470
It's all in the past.

272
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,380
What's the saying again?

273
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,350
The next one will be better.

274
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,730
Zhong Wei, look,

275
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,140
since we've settled it,

276
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,370
the video...

277
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,370
Actually,

278
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,850
I can delete it now.

279
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,569
But,

280
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,560
this time, the campus ambassador election

281
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,480
is related to our class's collective honor.

282
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,819
For the sake of the group,

283
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,730
I think

284
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,470
I need to give you some motivation

285
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,790
and drive.

286
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,119
What do you mean?

287
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,160
It means

288
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,130
if you want the video,

289
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,359
you better make a good poster.

290
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,560
You...

291
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,500
You're playing me.

292
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,320
What?

293
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,490
If I don't become the campus ambassador,

294
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,120
you can say goodbye

295
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,470
to your dreams for good.

296
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,420
You...

297
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,150
[Ticket Checkpoint] [Rest Area]

298
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,630
Two coke, please.

299
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,630
And popcorn.

300
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,220
Okay.

301
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,210
Thank you.

302
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,730
Give me your phone.

303
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,130
I'll pick up the tickets.

304
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I'll do it myself.

305
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,940
Let's go.

306
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,410
Okay.

307
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,390
Fang Mao,

308
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,180
Do you not love me anymore?

309
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,240
When did you change the password?

310
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,800
I just think

311
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,910
we should give each other

312
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,020
more space.

313
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
It's true indeed.

314
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,510
In the past,

315
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,440
there was no secret between us.

316
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,710
Since when…?

317
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,170
Tell me.

318
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,380
Since when…?

319
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,830
Luo Si.

320
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,140
If there ever comes a day

321
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,960
when I truly don't love you anymore,

322
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,240
it can only be because

323
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,560
you talk too much.

324
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,480
Zhong Wei.

325
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,830
Chen Miren, are you secretly drawing the campus heartthrob?

326
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,760
No.

327
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,380
He insisted that

328
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,260
I make a campus ambassador election poster for him.

329
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,280
Does Zhongwei really need a poster?

330
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,940
He's practically won already.

331
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,340
You don't know him well. Why do you help him?

332
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,060
I...

333
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,140
It must be Bao Jiaguo.

334
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,670
He advised me

335
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,970
to run for the ambassador.

336
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,660
I didn't go.

337
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,290
He then asked Zhong Wei to go.

338
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,160
Just a table tennis racket…

339
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,660
Why is he so enthusiastic?

340
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,780
I heard that

341
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,250
Bao Jiaguo has been the class monitor for twelve years.

342
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,860
Really?

343
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,060
The class he stays in,

344
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,930
could surely get the red flag representing excellence.

345
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,290
That explains why he's so proactive.

346
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,470
Thank God.

347
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,520
Do you think Chen Miren has gone crazy?

Zhong Wei.

519
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,840
Yu Dawei's team achieves the highest sales every year.

520
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,260
How dare you compare sales with him?

521
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,250
I think

522
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,600
you really have to bow and apologize this time.

523
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,000
He wants me to apologize?

524
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,130
No way.

525
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,010
Why don't you

526
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,910
just have your dad fire him once and for all?

527
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,910
What do you think?

528
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,660
Chao,

529
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,360
you're quite skilled in using others to do your dirty work.

530
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,490
You'd be perfect in palace intrigues.

531
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,530
No.

532
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,500
How can you think of me like that?

533
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,360
I'm saying this for your own good.

534
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,050
I've already asked Yi and the team to expedite the design process

535
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,250
and come up with an upgrade plan for the accompanying cat.

536
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,270
but we're still unsure about it.

537
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,000
Zhong Wei.

538
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,530
Are you listening to me?

539
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:28,950
Zhong Wei.

540
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,780
Temperature.

541
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,490
What?

542
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,980
Right,

543
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,980
company

544
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,940
should have warmth.

545
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,460
You have a point.

546
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,050
But

547
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,280
where does the warmth come from in a figurine?

548
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,540
What if we use a self-heating material?

549
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,140
Self-heating material?

550
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,780
Yes.

551
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,370
Once it comes into contact with the human body,

552
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,970
it emits a slight warmth,

553
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,500
making people feel cozy.

554
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,140
This would transform the figurine

555
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,060
from a cold toy

556
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,020
into a lively entity,

557
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,170
creating true warmth

558
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,940
in companionship.

559
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,910
Zhong Wei, you're a genius.

560
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,290
I'm going to get Yi and the others here.

561
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,740
Let's discuss it.

562
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,860
If the plan goes through,

563
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,200
I'll head to the Linzhou processing plant immediately.

564
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,000
Wait a minute.

565
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,440
I have something to do.

566
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,100
I have to go.

567
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,530
Where are you going?

568
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,410
You made the bet.

569
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,470
Even if you're not responsible for me,

570
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,420
you should be responsible for yourself.

571
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,640
What's the rush?

572
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,020
It's just the beginning.

573
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,960
Once I'm done with my work,

574
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,470
I'll accompany you to Linzhou.

575
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,730
What are you busy with?

576
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,320
Running for campus ambassador.

577
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,110
Isn't that a bit unlike you?

578
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,710
You're not usually so flamboyant and shallow.

579
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
I've always been.

580
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,110
Zhao Gu, I just borrowed your…

581
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,830
Chen Miren,

582
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,030
Monitor, I was wrong.

583
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,870
I'll reflect on myself.

584
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,270
I admit, skipping class was my mistake.

585
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,240
But

586
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,030
as an excellent student of Hanhai University

587
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,340
and a member of our class,

588
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,550
I have a proper mindset

589
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,610
and promote unity and friendship.

590
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,200
In my efforts to help a classmate campaign

591
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
and bring honor to our class,

592
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,850
I regretfully skipped a class.

593
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,110
I will reflect on this and strive to become a better person.

594
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,180
I didn't say anything.

595
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,880
Monitor, you're so generous, warm and cultured.

596
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,340
I must have saved the Milky Way in my past lives

597
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,470
to have you as my monitor.

598
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,430
Mr. Zou.

599
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,830
Chen Miren, I haven't said anything yet.

600
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,860
Hey,

601
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,150
this is for you.

602
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,300
It's not mine.

603
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,770
I know it's not yours.

604
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,700
It belongs to your classmate.

605
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,820
Take it.

606
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,220
[Girls' Dormitory]

607
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,630
Chen Miren,

608
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,110
Where are you going?

609
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,480
If you see Bao Jiaguo later,

610
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,520
just say you haven't seen me.

611
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,820
[Girls' Dormitory]

612
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,870
Bao Jiaguo.

613
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,620
What did you do to Chen Miren?

614
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,600
What are you doing?

615
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,409
Can you do me a favor and give it to Chen Miren…

616
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,080
Bao Jiaguo.

617
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,870
I never expected you to be this crazy.

618
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,860
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen for you♫
