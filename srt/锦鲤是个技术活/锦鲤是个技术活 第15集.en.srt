I want to ask you something.

230
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,060
If a person

231
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,880
has gained love using the identity of someone else,

232
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,680
and they really like each other,

233
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,570
but many years later,

234
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,930
the true owner of the identity came back,

235
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,460
what should that person do?

236
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,500

other people's life

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
Then... how does it end

242
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,280

243
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,480
Of course it doesn't end well.

244
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,990
No matter how proud and happy she is at the beginning,

245
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,530
as long as the true owner of the identity appears,

246
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,890
she'll become nobody immediately

247
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,550

Okay. The third one is

the radical expression and trigonometric substitution

263

are very obvious substitutions.

264
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,650
So we need a change of variable

to get upper and lower limits.

266
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,170

functions with upper limits in integration.

268
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,310
The fifth one is

269
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,230
upper limit functions are antiderivatives.

528
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,990
Once upon a time, an Italian soldier

529
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,240
was about to go to the battlefield.

530
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,490
But he had nothing to eat at home.

531
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,190
His wife who loved him prepared food for him.

532
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,580
She put all the dim sum and cookies

533
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,360
in a cake.

534
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,550
And this cake is called tiramisu.

535
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,030
It means

536
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,350
"take me with you".

537
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,390
Tiramisu indicates the reluctance to part

538
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,880
and sadness.

Even stir-fried spicy chicken

573
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,780
would be better than pig's large intestines.

574
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,990
Anyway,

575
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,100
it was all my fault.
