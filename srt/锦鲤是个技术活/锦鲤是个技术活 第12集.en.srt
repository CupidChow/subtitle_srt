People who get the right answer

346
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,280
will be able to participate in the lucky draw.

347
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,260
The prize includes not only a razor, shampoo,

348
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,930
shower gel,

349
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,290
but also a 500 yuan voucher

350
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,550
of the school grocery.

351
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,250
Those who guess we won't last a month

352
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,510
will definitely lose.

353
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,780
The ratio that thinks we can't make it

354
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,870
to those who believe we can is 500 to 1.

Chen Miren.

356
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,590
Did you vote?

357
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,540
Yes.

358
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,770
I voted anonymously.

359
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,230
So you're the one who supports us?

360
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,050
No.

361
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm one of the 500.

Why don't you have a positive expectation on us?

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,650
the best investment condition.

367
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,400
I want that 500 yuan voucher.

Chen Miren!

369
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,270
I'm basically telling you that this will be on the exam.

370
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,050
Sir,

371
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,700
don't worry.

372
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,810
I promise

373
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,369
in the next 80 years,

374
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,000
she'll always know how to solve this question.

375
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,089
Not necessary.

376
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,250
You only need to make sure that she knows the answer

377
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,349
in the final exam.

378
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,170
Okay.

380
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,210
Alright.

381

Let's continue.

Chen Miren.

383
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,490
You will definitely lose.

384
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
I think we can be together for 80 years.

The optimized investment ratio...

The sales figures of the second quarter is out.

387
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,780
I've seen it.

388
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,060
The sales of Companion Cats has quintupled.

389
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,630
It's five times!

390
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
You came here

391
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,510
just to listen to my compliment?

392
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,910
Not really.

393
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,390
I just want to see if you regret it.

394
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,190
If you do,

395
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,390
you can invest now.

396
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,060
I can accept it unwillingly.

397
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,290
I won't make a decision

398
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,900
until I see the sales for the third quarter.

399
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:13,980
Okay.

400
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,440
Zhong,

401
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,970
I heard that your son Zhong Wei

402
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,860
opened OHH Performance Store?

403
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,110
Yes, he's doing quite well.

404
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,850
Zhong,

405
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,050
you supported your son's business

406
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,650
with company funds.

407
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,860
Is this abusing of power for personal gains?

408
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,730
Listen.

409
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,240
Don't misunderstand me.

410
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,800
He did ask me to invest.

411
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,920
But for the sake of the company,

412
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,160
I didn't invest.

413
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,630
I didn't spend a penny of the company.

414
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,480
Where did he get so much money

415
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,710
at such a young age?

416
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,150
He is capable.

417
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,450
He got the investment himself

418
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,600
and opened his own shop.

419
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,400
What's wrong?

420
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,480
Did he eat the rice in your bowl?

421
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,060
Okay. Fine.

422
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,040
Your son is the best

423
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,240
and most capable one.

424
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,260
I was wrong.

425
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,470
Calm down, Zhong.

426
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,680
Don't always be so isolated.

427
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,610
You should be high-sighted, high-positioning,

428
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,910
and have noble sentiment.

429
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,790
We need to learn from the young

430
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,000
and improve our thinking.

431
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,660
Otherwise,

432
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,780
we'll be eliminated by the society sooner or later.

433
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,600
Impressive. I admire you.

434
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,240
Don't be mad.

435
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,080
The sales figures for the second quarter are out.

436
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,010
Our department's performance

437
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,500
is still number one.

438
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,330
Okay.

439
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,920
Keep following my instructions

440
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,440
in the next quarter.

441
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,360
No one can drop the ball.

442
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,330
Am I understood?

443
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,890
Yes.

444
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,280
I heard that the Companion Cats project team next door

445
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,820
also has satisfactory result this time.

446
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,150
Yes, they're the top three of the company.

447
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,380
Let's see how long can they last.

448
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,660
The strange offline performance store

449
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,150
is just a publicity stunt.

450
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,960
In my opinion,

451
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,330
once the customers' novelty wears off, it will go bankrupt.

452
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,120
Exactly.

453
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,170
Zhong Wei did everything he wanted

454
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,160
just because

455
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,510
he's the son of our boss.

456
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,000
If we did everything

457
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,400
out of our personal interest,

458
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,800
we would have been fired.

459
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,220
As a kid who hasn't graduated from university,

460
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,150
he knows nothing about the market.

461
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,940
Zhong Wei is much better than you.

462
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,360
Chen Miren, what did you say?

463
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,820
I said

464
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,880
it's so easy

465
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,590
to defeat them.

466
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,680
Enough.

467
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,480
Instead of flattering me here,

468
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,910
you'd better do

469
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,930
what I told you to.

470
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,940
Unlike the leader of other team,

471
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm much more strict.

472
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:39,870
Chen Miren.

473
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,320
How is the Mirage of the Forest

474
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,410
going?

475
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,940
I promise to submit the manuscript this week.

476
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,580
Very good.

477
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,740
Are you waiting for someone?

478
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,290
Chen Miren.

479
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,080
Chen Miren.

480
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,660
Zhong Wei and Chen Miren...

481
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,290
What's their relationship?

482
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,900
They're definitely not just classmates.

483
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Chen Miren.

484
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,710
Why are you avoiding me?

485
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,830
You have no idea.

486
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,930
Yu Dawei

487
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,200
hates you so much.

488
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,040
I don't want to lose my job.

489
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,190
I know.

490
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,020
Chen Miren.

491
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,640
Are you trying to have a secret affair

492
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,720
with me again?

493
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,290
Keep your voice down.

494
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,350
I read the company's rules a few days ago.

495
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,610
Office romance is strictly prohibited.

496
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,460
Once it's found out,

497
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,900
one of the couple has to be fired.

498
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,360
You are not gonna be fired.

499
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,050
Then I must be the one.

500
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,640
How come?

501
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,650
I'm not an employee in Heng Chang.

502
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,660
That's right.

503
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,600
But your family owns Heng Chang.

504
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,820
Chen Miren.

505
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,350
You're doing a great deal of damage to my self-esteem.

506
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,110
You know?

507
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,570
It feels like I'm not allowed to be seen by others as your boyfriend.

508
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,630
No way.

509
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,020
I am the one who reaches out for you.

510
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,110
Let's go.

511
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:15,990
I'm hungry.

512
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,110
What do you want to eat?

513
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,040
Braised chicken with rice.

514
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,880

Let's go and eat something nice.

516
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,090
This is delicious. Eat more.

517
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,460
And this.

518
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,190
This is their specialty.

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,230
Juice for table two is ready.

520

I'll get it.

521
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,380
Guess

522
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,860
who confessed first?

523

There's no doubt.

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,760
It must be that girl.

The boy's so handsome.

How can she be with him if she didn't take the initiative?

There's something going on.

This is unusual.

538
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,760
It's just the attraction

539
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,850
caused by hormone secretion.

540
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,610
It's simple.

You're quite the straight-A student.

Fine.

last time we had a class.

Take it away.

Why?

566
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,680
Do you know how long I've been planning this livestream?

567
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,160
And how much research I've done?

568
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,150
Do you think you can help me

569
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,310
by randomly buying some on the street?

570
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,240
Let me take roasted chestnuts for example,

571
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,700
only the most representative one can be chosen.

572
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,830
I mean, Nan Cheng's.

Okay, you got it by accident.

The Crispy Sweet Potato Pastry

576
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,950
must be from the most famous shop,

577

Jinghe Bakery.

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,940
This store is

584

three to four hours away from school, right?

585
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,780

and washed his clothes and socks.

Let me tell you.

694
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,510
Being aloof does work.

00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,300
Of course.

Lessons learned from a relationship genius like me

how it works.

Zhong Wei asked me to buy water for him.

701
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,030
That way, no one else would dare to buy water for him.

702
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,460
What's so special about that?

703
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,520
Didn't you buy him water

704
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,070
every time he plays basketball?

705

The point is,

706
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,010
just now,

707
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,440
he called me "sweetheart".

708
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,440
Oh my, sweetheart.

709
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,600
Zhong Wei called you that?

710
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,010
That's hilarious.

711
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,970
Did you call him back?

712
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,350
Of course not.

713
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,510
I have to be aloof.

714
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,179
Fine.

715
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,409
You're aloof.

716

I'm going to buy milk tea. Are you going?

717

No.

718
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,170
I haven't finished my manuscript.

What manuscript?

720
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,469
Just tell your colleagues

Zhong Wei is your sweetheart.

722
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,270
I shouldn't have told you.

723

Bye, sweetheart.

You said you dated a lot. Really?

Of course.

732
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,410
Tell me then.

Why is a girl

734
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,260
suddenly

735
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,160
be aloof to you?

736
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,670
There might be three reasons.

737
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,830
Either she likes someone else,

738
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,000
or she gets tired of you.

This girl has a mental disorder.

She can't maintain long-term intimacy.

It's extremely hard for her to be in a stable relationship.
