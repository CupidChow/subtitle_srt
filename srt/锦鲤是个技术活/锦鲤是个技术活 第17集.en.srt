Unlike us.

63

Although she doesn't talk much usually,

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,100
she's actually thoughtful,

70

She gives me chrysanthemum tea in summer.

She weaves scarves and gloves for me in winter.

73

Last time,

74

when my arthritis relapsed and I was hospitalized,

75
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,180
Luo Si weaved ten pairs of woollen knee pads for me.

76
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,190
Besides, there were some words on each pair of knee pads.

77
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,500

78

102

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,250
Get a drink?

176
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,210
What's wrong?

177
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,060
I need to go out.

178
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,140
It's late now. Where are you going?

179
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,380
I'll have a get-together with the roommates of my dorm.

180
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,260
It's not safe for a few girls to go out so late at night.

181
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,420
Where are you going? Is it safe?

182
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,750
When will you come back?

183
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,430
Our daughter has grown up.

184
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,560
She knows what to do.

185
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,460
Go.

186
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,660
Give her money.

187
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,790
You always spoil her.

188
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,260
Love you.

189
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,410
Do you think Miren has broken up with her boyfriend?

190
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,560
I don't think so.

191
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,340
Didn't she say that she was going out to have a get-together?

192
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,690
But I saw that her eyes were red just now.

193
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,410
Did she cry?

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,510
I think so.

195
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,900
How about this?

196
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,660
You should send a message to her.

197
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,500
Tell her that we'll pick her up if she

198
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,520
comes back late from the get-together.

199
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,980
Okay.

200
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,120
I'll send the message now.

201
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:38,780
[Beer]

202
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,020
Today is my breaking-up party.

203
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,600
Happy breaking-up.

204
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,180
Today is my breaking-up party.

205
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,660
Let's have fun together.

206
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,810
Okay.

207
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,940
Dylan,

208
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,150
your Chinese girlfriend is really beautiful.

209
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,390
Ex-girlfriend.

210
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,390
Why did you break up?

211
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,710
I dated another girlfriend.

212
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,710
But she found out.

213
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,270
No!

214
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,040
I broke up with you

215
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,890
just because

216
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,370
it's boring to be with you.

217
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,520
She said you're boring.

218
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,490
Cheers.

219
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,270
Cheers.

220
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,820
Cheers.

221
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,490
Why?

222
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,270
Chen Miren, you're finally here.

223
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,040
Why did you drink so much?

224
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,400
This is juice.

225
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,140
I broke up with Fang Mao.

226
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,370
You broke up with him?

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,310
It's the 58th time.

228
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,230
It's not a big deal that you two broke up.

229
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,190
You'll be reconciled with each other in two days.

230
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,640
We won't be reconciled with each other this time.

231
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,280
Why?

232
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,150
Today is his mother's birthday.

233
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,610
I was invited to her party.

234
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,670
After all my efforts for so long,

235
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,570
their family finally accepted me.

236
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,620
Isn't that good?

237
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,480
Yes, it's good.

238
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,570
I've changed from her daughter-in-law-to-be to her goddaughter.

239
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,370
What kind of confusing operation is that?

240
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,410
His family is a scholar family.

241
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,280
His mother has always looked down on

242
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,740
a non-intellectual family like mine,

243
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,200
so she has been against it.

244
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,410
What about Fang Mao?

245
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,790
What's his attitude?

246
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,660
He...

247
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,180
I thought even though his mother was against it,

248
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,380
he would still be with me determinedly.

249
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,820
We agreed to get married after graduation.

250
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,950
But in the end,

251
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,900
he didn't say a word.

252
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,710
Actually, you thought too much.

253
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,270
Fang Mao is a mama's boy.

254
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,870
Miao!

255
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,350
Maybe Fang Mao is regretting it now,

256
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,020
and he's thinking about how to make you happy.

257
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,790
Really?

258
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,900
Right, Miao?

259
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,180
Yes, yes.

260
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,030
He'll come and make up with you later.

261
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,510
He's on his way now.

262
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,830
When he arrives,

263
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,070
he'll beg for your forgiveness,

264
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,800
and make up with you.

265
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,110
Xu Miaomiao.

266
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,880
Why do you sound as if you had broken up with your boyfriend?

267
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,670
Fang Mao is a scumbag.

268
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,190
At least, he has been a scumbag from the beginning to the end.

269
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,110
Unlike Bao Jiaguo.

270
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,310
As a scumbag, he's enthusiastic sometimes, and indifferent sometimes.

271
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,940
Bao Jiaguo is a scumbag?

272
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,510
No wonder you've kept mentioning Bao Jiaguo lately.

273
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,790
Can I not mention him?

274
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,530
Bao Jiaguo

275
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,380
shows up in front of me every day.

276
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,460
I met him when I was running.

277
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,540
I met him during the live stream, too.

278
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,800
Whenever I need help,

279
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,970
he'll show up around me.

280
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,820
But recently,

281
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,200
he suddenly ignored me.

282
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,100
Why?

283
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,500
How would I know?

284
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,380
He took the blame

285
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,080
for cheating in the exam last time.

286
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,910
Think about it.

287
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,410
He cares so much about reputation,

288
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,740
and he has been the class monitor for 13 years continually.

289
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,220
He failed the exam and had to retake the course.

290
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,680
It's probably the biggest stain in his life.

291
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,300
If he says that he doesn't have a crush on me,

292
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,930
I don't believe it.

293
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,660
Neither do I.

294
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,400
Neither do I.

295
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,610
But why did he

296
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,940
suddenly ignore me?

297
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,630
Happy breaking-up.

298
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,730
Why aren't you sad at all?

299
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,710
We just broke up.

300
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,510
What's there to be sad about?

301
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,700
You hope that I would attempt suicide because of sadness?

302
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,060
I don't have the time.

303
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,070
I suddenly feel that I don't want to lose you.

304
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,980
You're really the most special Chinese girl I've ever seen.

305
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,590
You don't have to say that.

306
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,780
I broke up with Zhong Wei, too.

308
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,270
Why?

309
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,150
Because Cao Jiaer is back.

310
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,610
Cao Jia'er?

311
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,010
Who is Cao Jia'er?

312
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,940
Zhong Wei's childhood dream lover.

313
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,390
In high school,

314
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,980
he mistook me for Cao Jia'er.

315
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,920
That's why he dated me.

316
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,640
He could even mistake his dream lover for someone else?

317
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,280
What kind of dream lover is that?

318
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,240
Why don't you explain it clearly to Zhong Wei?

319
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,730
How can she explain it clearly for something like this?

320
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,450
Now Miren is just worried that

321
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,800
if she's not Zhong Wei's dream lover,

322
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,280
he'll break up with her.

323
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,390
After all,

324
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,870
between them,

325
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,090
there's at least the distance of two Xu Miaomiao,

326
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,660
plus another Xu Miaomiao.

327
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,520
Do you know how to comfort others?

328
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,490
I was thinking

329
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,040
if Zhong Wei knew that

330
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,470
I'm not Cao Jia'er,

331
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,050
and I even pretended to be Cao Jia'er just for being with him,

332
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,450
what he would think of me.

333
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,340
As expected,

334
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,780
he has been avoiding me since then.

335
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,510
Did you think too much?

336
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,940
No, I didn't!

337
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,140
He went to see the sunrise and watched movies

338
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,070
with Cao Jia'er.

339
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,690
They might have done some things

340
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,210
which I don't know.

341
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,070
Really?

342
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,140
Do you have evidence?

343
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,090

00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,280
Let me tell you.

682
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,940
I know another piece of news about our school's...

683
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,760
Huang Xiaoyue.

684
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,620
Huang Xiaoyue!

685
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,890
Why are you the only one in your dorm who has attended this class?

686
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,490
Are you asking about Zhong Wei or Bao Jiaguo?

687
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,440
I'm...

688
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,060
asking about them both.

689
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,120
Two boxes of milk.

690
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,700
I'll slap your face twice.

691
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,550
Zhong Wei, you're here.

692
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,630
Zhong Wei, you're here.

693
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,590
Zhong Wei.

694
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,800
Let's talk outside.

695
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,409
Okay.

696
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,010
It seems a bit serious.

697
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,370
Who is she?

698
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,000
Ren, do you know her?

699
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,889
She is Cao Jia'er.

700
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
She is Cao Jia'er?

701
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,670
Zhong Wei's dream lover.

702
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,750
You two should wait a moment.

703
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,300
I'll go ask him.

704
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,170
Just go.

705
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,739
Didn't I tell you not to come to see me at school?

706
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,640
But I've transferred to Hanhai.

707
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,320
Aren't you going to study in America soon?

708
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,310
My parents don't let me go back.

709
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,510
I could only finish my college in China.

710
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,160
Cao Jia'er,

711
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,920
Did you go to talk to Chen Miren?

712
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,810
No.

713
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,610
Fine.

714
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,660
I don't care whether you've talked to her or not.

715
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,300
Chen Miren is my girlfriend now.

716
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,030
I don't want you to disturb her.

717
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,420
Okay.

718
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,630
What's going on?

719
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,080
Cao Jia'er has transferred to the Business English Department.

720
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,540
Has she transferred to our school because of Zhong Wei?

721
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,540
She has really put in a lot of effort.

722
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,880
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
