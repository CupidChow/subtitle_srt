00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,290
adjusted from another major?

346
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:03,760
Yes.

347
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,170
People said

348
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,210
she was adjusted from the Animation Design.

349
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,600
But the adjustment should goes to the lower-scoring major, right?

350
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,330
It's rare to be adjusted to a higher-scoring one.

351
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,980
Let me tell you the reason.

352
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,110
My life goal

353
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,010
is to become the chief designer of action figures.

354
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,410
Animation Design hasn't been in popular demand

355
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,080
in our school.

356
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,820
There's only one student recruited this year.

357
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,930
They have no choice

358
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,460
except to cancel the major.

359
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,230
The only candidate

360
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,050
had to adjust her major.

361
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
The school called

362
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,180
and asked if I would accept the adjustment

363
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,830
or transfer to another school.

364
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,990
My mom never supported me to design the action figures.

365
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,210
So she agreed immediately

366
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,750
when she was told I could be adjusted to Business Administration.

367
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,870
Think about it.

368
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,180
With my maths level,

369
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,580
it will be a miracle that I can graduate.

370
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,540
Then you will miss the opportunity

371
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,060
to fulfill your dream?

372
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,800
I won't be defeated

373
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,500
by these minor difficulties.

374
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,790
I've submitted my resume to Heng Chang.

375
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,620
As long as I can work at Heng Chang,

376
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,130
being the chief designer of action figures

377
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,170
will be around the corner.

378
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,060
Is Heng Chang that extraordinary?

379
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,980
Of course.

380
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,589
Heng Chang is the best company of action figures.

381
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,250
It leads the trend in the entire Asia-Pacific area,

382
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,290
or even the global trend of design.

383
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,020
It will be the starting point of my dream.

384
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,569
Chen Miren, you're only a freshman.

385
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,760
So what?

386
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,780
If you want to succeed, you have to plan ahead.

387
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,890
Be ready for your ideal at all times.

388
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,650
Zhao Gu, what about your dream?

389
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,250
To pass the postgraduate entrance exam.

390
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,100
Come on.

391
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,640
Cheers to our different ideals.

392
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,210
Cheers!

393
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,480
This is very tasty.

394
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,980
So is this one.

395
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,320
Pass the ball.

396
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,660
Pass it to me.

397
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,360
Nice shot!

398
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,960
Run! Run!

399

Xu Miaomiao, you really got into Hanhai?

400
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,140
Yes.

401
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Zheng Ze, long time no see.

402
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,430
Long time no see.

403
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,680
Zheng Ze.

404
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,580
Stop chatting.

405
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,570
I'll go play with them.

406
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,540
Go ahead.

407
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,220
Come and watch me play basketball some day.

408
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,530
Zheng Ze, who is that?

409
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,410
She's pretty.

410
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,410
My high school junior, Xu Miaomiao.

411
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,270
This year's campus belle is gorgeous.

412
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,880
When will you introduce her to me?

413
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,140
Just play basketball.

414
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,080

415
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,340
Xu Miaomiao.

416
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,030
Xu Miaomiao?

417
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,340
Who are you?

418
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,740
I'm the monitor, Bao Jiaguo.

419
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,860
What's up?

420
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,150
Xu Miaomiao.

421
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,420
I signed you up for the campus ambassador election campaign.

422
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,950
It's very important.

423
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,670
This is our first activity in college.

424
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,250
It concerns the honor of our class.

425
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,140
So we must participate actively.

426
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,910
As far as I know,

427
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,200
the ratio of boys and girls in our school is 3:7.

428
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,730
Why don't you ask Zhong Wei?

429
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,740
Zhong Wei...

430
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,900
This is an legal violation of my portrait rights.

431
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,700
I'm not going.

432
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,720
You'll get a prize if you win.

433
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,520
It's a pair of ping pong paddles.

434
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,460
I'm not interested in ping pong paddles.

435
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,070
I see.

436
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,510
You like playing basketball, don't you?

437
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,510
I can apply for a basketball for you.

438
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,860
Save it, please.

439
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,810
Xu Miaomiao, are you in?

440
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,330
Let me make it clear.

441
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,610
if I don't win,

442
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,970
don't blame me for that.

443
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,290
Of course I won't.

445
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,940
as long as you can stand on the stage,

446

even if you don't say anything,

447
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,390
our class will definitely win.

448
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,310
We will definitely win?

449
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,040
Definitely!

450
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,720
For what?

451
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Your pretty face.

452
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,100
I hate people saying that I'm just another pretty face!

453
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,370
I'm not going!

454
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,510
What's wrong with that?

455
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,250
Isn't your pretty face a gift?

456
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,540
All good-looking people are weird.

457
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,560
Zhong Wei and Xu Miaomiao have gone too far.

458
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,560
When our class needed their contribution,

459
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,080
they both quit.

460
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,900
That's right.

461
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,910
So, Bao Jiaguo,

462
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,680
I've decided.

463
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,520
If they won't participate in the election campaign,

464
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,240
I'll!

465
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,170
Pardon me?

466
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,900
I've prepared the clothes

467
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,550
for the election campaign.

468
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,960
Look. The Japanese youth style.

469
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,250
The elegant gentleman style.

470
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,110
And the mature and stylish style.

471
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,730
If it doesn't work,

472
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,960
for our class,

473
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,850
I can sacrifice myself

474
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,480
and be sexy.

475
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,690
No, no, no.

477
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,710
Are you really not going to run for the campus ambassador?

478
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,300
Why don't you reconsider it?

479
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,010
I'm not into it.

480
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,940
So I'm not going.

481
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,630
Bao Jiaguo, let's discuss

482
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,250
which style I should choose.

483
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
I think playing cute is not bad, too.

484

485

and there exists an original function Fx,

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,710
then fx is integrable on a subset of a to b.

[Zhang's Buns]

688
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,430
Chen Miren.

689
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,650
Wait for me in the woods at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

690
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,310
What are you going to do again?

691
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,180
What do you mean "again"?

692
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,790
[Boy's Dormitory]

693
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,800
Draw a poster for me.

694
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,830
Drawing a poster?

695
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,420
Are you really going to run for the campus ambassador?

696
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,410
You can just take a photo and print it out.

697
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,800
Why bother?

698
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,950
Printing is a waste of money.

699
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,700
Seriously?

700
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,650
You even want to save the printing cost?

701
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,850
You're so stingy.

702
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,550
This milk tea is good.

703
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Buy me another cup tomorrow.

704
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,120
Are you sure?

705
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,660
Absolutely.

706
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,660
Tomorrow, we'll have a basketball match

707
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,950
with the seniors.

708
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,290
Zhong Wei is going to be the leading forward.

709
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,670
We'll get changed in the locker room at nine,

710
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,880
and warm up before 9:30.

711
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,410
The game will start at 10.

712
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,760
If everything goes well,

713
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,860
in 40 minutes,

714
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,410
we'll win the game

715
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,230
with my perfect assist.

716
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,030
You are quite well-informed.

717
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,500
Here.

718
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,320
Chen Miren.

719
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,690
Tell me,

720
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,670
why do you want to know the whereabouts of

721
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,820
Zhong Wei?

722
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,050
I'm not the one who wanted to know.

723
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,620
It's Zhen Chunhua from the Department of Chinese Literature next door.

724
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,550
It's natural for a school hunk to have some crazy fans.

725
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,210
In order to know his information,

726
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,500
she's willing to pay for a month's worth of snacks,

727
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,110
you know?

728
