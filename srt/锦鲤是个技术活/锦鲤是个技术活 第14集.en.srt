This kind of character

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,829
can't even be the female lead in novels.

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,820
Indeed.

37
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,700
The heroine in novels

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,980
would beckon with her finger

39
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,579
and the male lead would come.

The status of the male lead was forcibly decreased.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,510
It's fine if the supporting female and male characters are together.

52
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,750
But the supporting female character is so independent and strong.

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,170
How could she tell her colleagues

when I was carrying a bag that was worth 20 yuan?

349
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,580
You said that

350
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,380
you would only carry my bag in your lifetime.

351
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,600
You're being unreasonable.

352
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,140
Apologize to Weijing.

353
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,920
I apologize to her?

354
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,430
Yes.

355
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,010
Okay.

356
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,540
I apologize.

357
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,260
Don't step on it.

358
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,060
Don't step on it.

359
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,120
What are you doing?

360
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,500
Luo Si.

361
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,100
I only knew that you were so barbaric today.

362
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,790
Let's go.

363
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,030
What do you mean?

364
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,420
You want to take her away?

365
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,160
Luo Si,

366
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,560
what you did today was inappropriate.

367
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,510
Let me tell you again.

368
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,860
Today we are only participating in a group activity.

369
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,660
Yao Weijing and I did nothing.

370
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,450
Let's go.

371
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,280
Nonsense.

372
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,050
I saw you touching her hand.

373
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,100
Scum!

374
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,670
You still deny it?

375
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,350
Others saw you touching her hand.

376
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,100
Don't talk nonsense.

377
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,550
When did I touch her hand?

378
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,310
You still won't admit it?

379
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,280
You touched it.

380
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,590
Which eye did you see that?

381
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,300
What happened?

382
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,540
Fang Mao, Weijing.

383
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,360
What's wrong?

384
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,160
Are you going to fight?

385
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,190
Go! Go! Go!

386
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,940
Go! Go! Go!

387
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,830
Come on! Come on!

388
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,410
Laugh if you want.

389
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,680
I ranked last and held back our class.

390
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
I admit it.

391
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,690
It's about participation.

392
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,920
You're already great.

393
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,850
Besides, who said you are the last?

394
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,360
Someone is even slower than us?

395
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,110
Who?

396
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,500
Zhao Gu and Luo Si.

397
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,610
[Guanhai Bell Tower]

398
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,900
It's urgent. Come quickly.

399
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,910
What's wrong?

400
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,840
Something happened to Zhao Gu and Luo Si.

401
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,550
Don't cry.

402
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,550
Are you okay?

403
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,490
Luo Si, are you okay?

404
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,680
What happened?

405
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,590
We're catching the adulterers.

406
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,010
What do you mean?

407
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,940
I told you the Poetry Society was here for inspiration.

408
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,580
Luo Si.

409
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,490
Apologize to Weijing.

410
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,470
Apologize?

411
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,770
For what?

412
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,910
You should apologize to her.

413
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,350
Why should we apologize?

414
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,160
Exactly.

415
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,820
You hit people without hesitation.

416
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,950
I've never seen such a barbaric person.

417
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,320
You should have thought of this day

418
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,150
when you behaved so inappropriately with another person's boyfriend.

419
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,030
Who's inappropriate?

420
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,470
You are framing me.

421
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,830
Xu Miaomiao, don't be afraid.

422
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,670
We're here.

423
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,050
Why should I be afraid?

424
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,350
Luo Si.

425
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,200
How much bigger do you want to make this?

426
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,940
Apologize.

427
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,180
Then we're done.

428
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,480
You should be the one to apologize.

429
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,530
Li Jinshan.

430
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,870
What are you doing here?

431
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,430
I had to pee. I drank too much drinks.

432
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,850
I just went to the toilet.

433
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,020
Who knew I would come across such a melodramatic situation?

434
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,660
I hate scumbags the most in my life.

435
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,500
I just wanted to punch him.

436
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,300
I didn't expect them to come so soon.

437
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,890
They bullied me.

438
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,100
They don't have moral ethics.

439
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,190
Who are you talking about?

440
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,070
Who are you pulling?

441
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't you know who you're pulling?

442
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,560
How dare you touch students

443
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,960
from Hanhai University?

444
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,410
Calm down.

445
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,890
We can't sit down and talk.

446
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,150
The people from your school started it.

447
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,220
If you don't apologize today,

448
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,160
this is not over.

449
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,620
Yes, apologize.

450
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,070
You can't leave without an apology.

451
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,800
Exactly.

452
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,960
You want to leave after hitting someone?

453
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,560
There's no way we'll let you.

454
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,560
Luo Si,

455
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,120
we can just talk in private.

456
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,520
Can you apologize? Please?

457
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,690
I'll say it again.

458
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,370
Apologize? Impossible.

459
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,520
Then don't blame us for being rude.

460
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,700
Calm down.

461
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,060
Stop fighting!

462
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,320
Stop fighting.

463
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,190
Forgiving and breaking up

464
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,610
are all Luo Si's own business.

465
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,490
Why are you fighting here?

466
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,240
Don't you think it's childish?

467
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,290
No.

468
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,020
I mean

469
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,220
we can change to a more civilized way

470
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,920
to solve the problem.

471
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,590
How?

472
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,510
Tell me.

473
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,170
A poetry contest.

474
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah.

475
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,430
Aren't you from the Poetry Society?

476
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,280
Just right.

477
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,530
Poetry contest?

478
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,070
Okay.

479
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,910
If you lose,

480
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,020
apologize.

481
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,140
What do you mean "just right?"

482
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,360
What kind of bad idea is that?

483
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,190
Poetry contest.

484
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,590
Are you going to compete?

485
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,560
Zhong Wei.

486
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,770
Well,

487
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,990
aren't you interested in modern poems?

488
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,310
Just do me a favor.

489
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,800
I'll do something for you in the future.

490
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:51,720
Fine.

491
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,310
If you lose,

492
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,330
let it go.

493
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,290
Okay.

494
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,840
Who will go first?

495
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:07,790
[We've been through the years together.]

496
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,490
I controlled it.

497
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,380
Go!

498
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,180
Coming.

499
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,460
You go first. Watch me.

500
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,620
Destroy the tower.

501
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,680
Destroy the tower!

502
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,060
Perfect.

503
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,320
I asked him to go to Shuangling Mountain.

504
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,920
He said it would be tiring

505
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,060
and hot

506
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,350
with many mosquitoes.

507
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,480
But he was willing

508
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,340
to go hiking with Flirty Yao.

509
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,880
If you think about it positively.

510
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,890
At least they're not dating alone.

511
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,440
This was a group activity.

512
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,000
That's not acceptable too.

513
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,120
We should also inform each other about group activities.

514
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,540
I controlled it.

515
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,220
Go!

516
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,240
Coming.

517
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,710
You go first. Watch me.

518
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,430
The tower is about to be destroyed.

519
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,600
Destroy the tower!

520
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,340
The tower is about to be destroyed.

521
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,130

Let me see.

694
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,350
And this.

695
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:20,860
Yes.

696
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,750
Look.

697
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,600
Luo Si,

698
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,100
you shouldn't make up with Fang Mao so easily this time.

699
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,380
Yes.

700
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,750
He can't be forgiven.

701
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,080
Just leave her alone.

702
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,060
No.

703
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,180
When things quiet down,

704
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,800
they'll reconcile without a word.

705
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,500
No.

706
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,560
I won't make up with him this time.

707
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,290
I don't feel at ease with you.

708
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,980
Luo Si.

709
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,510
We're not against your relationship with Fang Mao.

710
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,750
Whether you make up or not is your own business.

711
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,390
We can only offer

712
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,160
some suggestions as a bystander.

713
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,100
I think Fang Mao's attitude towards you

714
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,060
is not right.

715
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,340
You have to think about it.

716
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,280
Exactly.

717
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,929
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

718
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,960
it's not right to support another girl in front of so many people.

719
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,929
He just can't.

720
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,420
Fang Mao kept on asking you to apologize to Yao Weijing.

721
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,040
His way of dealing with problems

722
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
was problematic.

723
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,510
Zhao Gu.

724
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,159
Did you see Fang Mao touch Yao Weijing's hand?

725
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,710
I didn't.

726
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,480
I just think

727
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,550
Li Jinshan is talking nonsense.

728
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,340
Oh no.

729
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,310
After talking for a long time, it means nothing.

730
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,219
She'll make up with Fang Mao tomorrow.

731
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,290
If he doesn't take the initiative,

732
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,030
I won't find him.

733
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,989
Forget it.

734
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,219
I don't believe you.

735
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,060
Chen Miren.

736
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,960
Does my hair still smell?

737
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,790
Miaomiao.

738
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,080
You've washed it eight times already.

739
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
There's no smell.

740
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,090
It really doesn't smell anymore.

741
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,330
The smell of two bottles of shampoo.

742
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,350
It smells good.

743
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,100
That's good.

744
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,860
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
