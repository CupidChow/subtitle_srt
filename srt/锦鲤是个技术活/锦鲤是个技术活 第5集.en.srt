How many marks did you get?

108
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,250
Sir, I have a question for you.

109
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,340
Set the origin X0 and Y0,

110
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,980
then the tangent equation passing through the origin is...

111
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,430
Y equals two times the square root of X0 minus one-half.

112
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,430
Then, I concluded that X0 equals 4Y0,

113
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,320
which equals the square root of 2.

114
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,660
I see.

115
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,310
The answer is three halves times the square root of two.

116
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,170
Thank you. Sir.

117
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,020

Isn't it attractive?

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,460
Look at these symbols.

126
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,440
I recognize them by looking at them separately.

127

Why do they look like the Book of Heaven when put together?

128

You mean her, right?

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,500
How could she...

130

Can't you talk openly?

131
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,590
We didn't talk about you.

132
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,360
Right.

133
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,660
But you kept pointing and whispering.

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,090
I'm sure you didn't say anything good.

135

Don't you know?

There's a thief in your dorm.

Are you talking about me?

138

I didn't say that.

139
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,780
You said it yourself.

140
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,700
What did I steal?

141
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,080
As to what you stole,

142
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
you know better than we do.

143
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,770
Do you have any proof that she's a thief?

144
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,960
I didn’t say that.

145
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,670
Shi Hou from Grade 3 said it.

146
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,170
Who is he?

147
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,540
This is about our dormitory, and I don't know anything.

148
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,520
How could he know?

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,909
Shi Hou is Zhao Gu's boyfriend.

150
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,620
Zhao Gu has a boyfriend?

151
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,180
You don't even know that as her roommate.

152
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,060
It seems that

153
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,200

154
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,730

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,659
Zhao Gu.

156
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,200
You told others

157
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,680
that Chen Miren is a thief?

158
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,540
I said it.

159
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,150
What evidence do you have?

160
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,110
Luo Si lost something too.

161
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,400
Those are worthless, Zhao Gu.

162
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,840
This must be a misunderstanding.

165
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,840
Let's make it clear.

Zhao Gu.

167

unwrapped your package by mistake.

169
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,200
Do you have to be so petty?

170
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,710
This has nothing to do with the package.

171
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,150
Chen Miren.

172
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,860
Don't regret if I tell them.

173

685
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,300
You're different.

686
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,830
You are the base position talent we need the most

687
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,650
right now.

688
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,450
Well, I...

689
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,820
If Xu Miaomiao joins the cheerleading team, I'm in.

690
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,040
Or I'll quit.

691
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,000
You mean

692
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,220
buy one and get one free?

693
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,240
You're making things difficult for me.

694
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,570
I can only lift her.

695
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,280
Well...

696
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,760
Also, congratulations to Xu Miaomiao.

697
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,990
Welcome to join the cheerleading team.

698
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,620
Buy one and get one free.

699
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,950
It's okay.

700
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,400
We are teammates from now on.

701
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,489
I’ll protect you.

702
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,000
Yes.

703
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,420
Coach.

704
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,909
Since I'm a member of the cheerleading team,

705
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,159
I have to say something.

706
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,830
I think

707
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
our team uniform is too ugly.

708
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,120
I suggest finding a professional designer

709
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,469
to design a new uniform for us.

710
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,400
Xu Miaomiao.

711
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,650
We won't disturb the coach.

712
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,389
Who disturbed the coach?

713
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,420
Am I right, Coach?

714
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,880
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
