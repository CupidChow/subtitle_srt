Yes.

Send some staff to the Companion Cats Project Team.

We should develop the product and the scale simultaneously.

00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,990
By the end of the third quarter,

11
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,860
our sales will definitely increase

12

Your experience store has been open

for a few months now.

16
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,870
How much is the total revenue by now?

00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,600
One million.

18
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,539
How much capital was invested in the early stages?

19
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,340
Five million.

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,509
If I invest,

21
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,000
how long will it take to get the capital back?

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,610
I haven't calculated that in detail yet.

23

I will support any decision you make.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,530
But as an investor,

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,450
I need to consider the return rate on investment.

27
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,530
Besides, I'm the owner of Heng Chang,

28

Did your dad agree this time?

and focus on design.

34

As expected.

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,270
Since we can't expand in scale,

36
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,440
we must win with quality.

37

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,920
Explain what this is.

177
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,620
The steam-powered robot version of the Mushroom Girl.

178
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,900
The wolf that can never eat lamb,

179
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,550
wearing patchwork shorts.

180
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,240
And there's also a noseless elephant.

181
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Chen Miren.

182
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,580
Don't you think your imagination

183
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,980
is a bit too unrealistic?

184
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,030
Mr. Yu,

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,380
isn't this more in line

186
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,730
with the theme of the Mirage of the Forest?

187
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,440
And behind them,

188
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,070
there are actually stories.

189
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,020
The Mushroom Girl,

190
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,900
her father was actually a scientist,

191
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,500
and she got sick and passed away at a very young age.

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,430
Her father couldn't bear to let her go,

193
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,260
so he created

194
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,700
a robot identical to her.

195
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,930
As to this wolf...

196
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,610
Chen Miren,

197
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,970
our target audience is young people.

198
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,200
They simply don't have the time or interest to learn

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,680
about these so-called heartwarming stories behind them.

200
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,940
Our responsibility

201
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,700
is to visually impact them

202
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,700
in the most direct way

203
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,460
and arouse their desire to purchase.

204
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,520
But I don't believe

205
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,000
that young people are synonymous with impatience.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
They also have the desire

207
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,220
to delve into the stories

208
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,470
behind outstanding works.

209
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,530
At least the market research results

210
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,740
prove I'm right.

211
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,780
But...

212
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,710
You're still young,

213
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,630
and there's a lot for you to learn.

214
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,000
As you know,

215
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,510
there are many people out there

216
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,700
trying to grab the position

217
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,260
of a designer in our gold medal project team

218
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,600
I hope you can cherish this opportunity.

219
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,270
I will make the changes.

220
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,270
Hello?

221
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Hello, Zhong Wei.

222
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,290
I have a dormitory safety agreement on my desk.

223
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,150
Can you give it to the dorm keeper?

224
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,200
Sure, no problem.

225
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,800
Thank you.

[Author: A Caged Bird]

228
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,770
As Lin Miaomiao walked out of the company's gate,

229
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,860
she saw a luxury car parked on the side of the road.

230
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,110
After the car door opened,

231
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,160
a pair of feet stepped out.

232
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,240
Get in.

233
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,480
Are you hungry?

234
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,170
Kind of.

235
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,160
Do you want to go to the restaurant we went to last time?

236
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,480
I hope you can cherish this opportunity.

237
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,560
Sure.

238
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,450
I saw a new movie is on in the cinema.

239
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,910
It's your favorite horror movie.

240
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,570
Anything is fine. You decide.

241
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,180
Tell me what you think.

242
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,430
I want to be quiet.

243
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,090
OK?

244
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,200
Sorry.

245
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,690
I'm in a bad mood today.

What do you mean?

252
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,740
Nothing.

253
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,820
I just think

254
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,570
that if you have any issues with me, you can tell me directly.

255
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,100
There's no need for this silent treatment.

256
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,750
Who doesn't have bad days?

257
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,430
Do I have to put on a happy face in front of you

258
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,160
even when I'm not feeling good?

259
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,470
Are you okay?

260
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,990
Say something.

261
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,150
I'm not okay.

262
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,400
I've been working on the revisions day and night for several days,

263
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,120
and the director still rejected them.

264
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,970
I was just in a bad mood and didn't say much,

265
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,080
and you accused me of giving you the silent treatment.

266
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,940
You've been ignoring me for days.

267
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,960
Don't cry.

268
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm sorry.

I didn't know you were in a bad mood.

270
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,090
I shouldn't have blamed you.

271
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,910
Actually,

272
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,380
it's not entirely because I was feeling down.

273
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,720
The girls told me

274
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,710
not to be too proactive in a relationship,

275
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,600
or else you wouldn't cherish me.

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,720
So, I deliberately distanced myself from you.

277
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,680
Distanced yourself from me?

278
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,490

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,140
What do you mean?

346
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,540
You don't look like a curious person.

347
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,230
Tell me.

348
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,660
How do you know the rules of live streaming?

349
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,470
I want to try live streaming too,

350
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,870
so I thought I'd study it.

351
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,210
I have experience with live streaming.

352
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,400
I can teach you if you want.

353
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,030
Let me tell you.

354
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,430
The most important thing in live streaming is the content...

355
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,020
If you want to learn,

356
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,300
I can teach you another day.

357
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,630
I'll go get changed now.

358
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,570
I'll wait for you.

359
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,320
Don't wait for me.

360
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,160
Go back early.

361
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,250
Don't catch a cold.

362
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,270
Bao Jiaguo.

363
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,890
Did you fall into the water?

364
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,630
No.

365
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,620
I jumped into it.

366
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,560
Why did you jump in?

367
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,400
Swimming, fishing,

368
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
or practicing holding your breath?

369
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,120
The platform

370
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,890
strictly prohibits live streaming of content that endangers

371
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,890
one's own safety.

372
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,080
What are you talking about?

373
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,110
Are you crazy?

374
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,060
Hurry up, Chen Miren.

375
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,000
Where's your phone?

376
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,310
What's wrong?

377
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,890
Today is the day when the results of the Winter Olympics Ambassador

378
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,790
election are announced.

379
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,790
My phone is dead.

380
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,300
Use mine.

381
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,950
Guo Xiaoya.

382
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,370
[No. 26 Xu Miaomiao]

383
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,370
Xu Miaomiao.

384
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,810
You're in first place.

385
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,850
Your practice of holding your breath for three and a half minutes paid off.

386
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,850
Don't mention it.

387
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,270
I almost got banned.

388
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,980
Why?

389
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
It's a long story.

390
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,860
However,

391
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,050
thanks to our monitor's quick thinking.

392
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,280
He pulled me out of the water,

393
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,540
so I didn't get banned.

394
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
That's a relief.

395
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,130
Otherwise, the Winter Olympics Ambassador

396
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,660
would have been Guo Xiaoya.

397
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,830
So

398
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,330
I have to treat him to a meal.

399
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,170
A meal?

400
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,050
Take me with you.

401
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,310
Why should I bring you?

402
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:26,280
[Xu Miaomiao]

403
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,930
Thank you for today.

404
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,970
I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow.

405
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:22,730
Okay.

406
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,810
What should I wear tomorrow?

407
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,800
Aren't you being too polite?

408
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,680
Last time you helped me buy ingredients for the livestream,

409
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,630
it was a big help to me,

410
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,010
and I haven't thanked you properly.

411
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,210
Let's consider this a thank-you meal for both occasions.

412
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,480
Aren't you eating?

413
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm on a diet.

414
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,550
What's wrong?

415
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,820
The author I like

416
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,090
is campaigning for my livestream.

417
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,470
After all, the Winter Olympics is a national event,

418
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,460
and it's normal for you to receive attention.

419
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,790
Besides, in the new chapters he recently released,

420
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,370
a mysterious character named Bao Zhendong

421
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,340
appeared by the female lead's side.

422
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,400
The way things are going,

423
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,110
he seems poised to replace the male lead

424
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,640
and be with the female lead.

425
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,620
It's not meant to replace the male lead, is it?

426
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,580
Isn't love full of surprises?

427
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,130
Well, this is delicious.

428
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,260
This is delicious.

Zhao Gu?

431
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,980
Hello.

432
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,940
OK. Thank you.

433
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,810
Isn't Zhao Gu dating Shi Hou?

434
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,150
Why is she here on a date with a foreigner?

435

Enjoy your food.

Don't be as gossip-hungry as Huang Xiaoyue.

437

The vanilla cappuccino

438
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,510
is a specialty of this café.

This is the earring you left here last time.

Who were you talking to on the phone?

it's for my dad?

There must be a lot of people chasing you.

She's quite serious about flattering her.

How did you get together?

514
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,920
It was a romantic rainy night.

515
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,150
I wore a white dress
