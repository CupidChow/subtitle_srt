7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,404
Give me the contract.

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,582
Well done.

9
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,502
- Hey. Byung Min.
- Yes, boss.

10
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,295
Rip off the account now.

00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,702
Let's never meet again. Go.

Are we over?

16
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,141
Who do you think you are
to end it like this?

17
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,505
It's the end.

18
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,924
There's no end.

19
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,679
There's no place to go anymore.

20
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,182
When you think it's the end,
that's the new start.

21
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,937
But I'm tired.

22
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,155
Don't give up.

23
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,575

it continues.

27

but it's really cool.

(Cheer Up Milk)

31
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,925
I'm sad because...

32
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,679
without having time
to look back at my feelings,

33
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,974
I have to live my life...

34
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,102
as I have done until now.

35
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,016
You're a jerk.

36
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:36,813
What?

37
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,526
Because I beat you
and came in first?

38
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,570
I have to pay off all my debt
to stay next to you.

39
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,538
How can you place first in the world
when you can't even beat me?

40
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,582
You're even stupid.

41
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,418
Did you think I wouldn't even
celebrate if you win?

42
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,087
Did you think I'm that petty?

43
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,548
Is that why you changed
the password?

44
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,217
You must always be consistent.

45
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,553
You said everything in your heart
until now,

46
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,346
but you disappear
when you finally have to?

47
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,516
- Are you trying to drive me crazy?
- You're even worse.

48
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,394
I gave you my heart,

49
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,146
but you tried to give me money.

50
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,484
You give your heart because
you expect a heart in return.

51
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,445
Why do you act like
you don't understand me?

52
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,364
It pressured me...

53
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,659
that you liked me so much.

54
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,999
Why would you care about my dream?
It's not your dream.

55
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,626
That made me feel uncomfortable.

56
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,545
So what do you want?

57
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,470
Don't be my pacemaker.

58
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,556
Be my rival.

59
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,434
Don't tell me what to do.

60
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,228
You can only love...

61
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,398
when you're equal.

62
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,069
When you're being yourself,
and when I'm being myself.

63
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,034
Love?

64
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm not sure because
I've never been in love before,

65
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,541
but I think this is love.

66
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,261
I like you.

67
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,017
I love you, Sang Ha.

68
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,856
I love you too.

69
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,262
What should we do?

70
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,139
I'm not sure.

71
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,393
I've never been on a date before.
I don't know what to do.

72
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,188
It's not like
I've been on one before.

73
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,525
You've never been on a date before?

74
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,485
No.

75
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,864
No.

76
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,535
I haven't.

77
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,418
Jin Won. Why are you so cute?

78
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,213
First, let's walk.

79
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,174
Good idea.

80
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,360
Wait.

81
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,779
My heart is pounding.

82
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,825
Walking doesn't suit us.

83
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,702
Then shall we run?

84
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,173
Do you know what's similar about
marathon and love?

85
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,552
Once you start, you can't stop.

86
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,058
Both marathon and love
make your heart pound.

87
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,605
