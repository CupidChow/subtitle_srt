1
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,049
The more you think,
the more you can't stop thinking.

2
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,887
I think not thinking is the best.

3
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,974
Stop thinking and go to sleep!

4
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,994
The marathon is tomorrow.

5
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,505
(9 hours before the marathon)

6
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,797
It's today.

7
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,761
Please.

8
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,681
Please let me sleep tonight.

12
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,169
Yes.

13
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,838
Let's sleep like this.

14
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,481
(Go Sang Ha)

15
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,967
I was able to sleep at night
after a long time.

(Miha University Dormitory)

17
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,755
You're...

18
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,007
from last time...

19
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,010
Good morning.

20
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,930
Go, Jin Won!

21
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,209
- How was it?
- The time for 5km wasn't bad,

22
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,877
but your pace isn't steady.

23
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,632
Can you show me the lap time per km?

24
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,300
Look.

25
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,055
You totally lost your pace.

26
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,974
To run for the world championship,

27
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,435
you have to run the first 5km
of 25km in 15 minutes.

28
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,647
Even if you go over 15 minutes,
it should be plus-minus 10 seconds.

29
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,275
In 100m, that's 18 seconds.

30
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,820
I'll keep your pace.

31
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,073
Right now, you can't even
complete the marathon.

32
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,283
You punk...

33
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,451
Who do you think you are?

34
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,870
Hey.

35
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,914
Your language is too coarse
for your face.

36
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,916
Say hi.

37
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,589
Hello. I'm a freshman PE major.
My name is Go Sang Ha.

38
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,341
How dare you teach your senior?
You're only a freshman.

39
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,803
You can't sleep at night
because your record isn't stable.

40
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,890
Your record gets worse because you
can't sleep. It's a vicious cycle.

41
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,059
So I brought a pace maker for you.

42
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,980
I don't need help when I exercise.

43
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,690
He's really something.

44
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,317
He's slow in short distances,

45
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,360
but he has an amazing skill
for getting in time.

46
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,030
He can make it
in at the exact time he wants.

47
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,990
No thanks. I don't need it.

48
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,742
I said he can help you.

49
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:12,951
Come on.

50
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,413
Ji Won.

51
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,957
What's the point of having a new
marathon record from high school?

52
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,335
You haven't run properly
since you came to university.

53
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,794
I said no.

54
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,216
How can I use an amateur
as a pace maker?

55
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,640
How dare you block
your senior's way?

56
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,725
Move.

57
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,605
You can test me.

58
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,400
I'll run in at the time you say.

59
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,986
19 seconds?

60
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,865
18 seconds.

61
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,791
Good luck.

62
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,417
Here we go.

63
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,470
Go.

64
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,065
See? I said he's really something.

65
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,694
Sang Ha. Where did he go?

66
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,489
Sang... Sang Ha. You can stop now.

67
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,033
Sang... Hey!

68
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,255
He is amazing.

69
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,471
The track is 100m,
and I ran 400m more. So that's 500m.

70
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,474
If you times that by 18 seconds,
that's 90 seconds.

71
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,271
You'd say it's a coincidence
if I ran only one lap.

72
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,191
This way, you won't say anything.

73
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,862
You should get my help.

74
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,948
I'm qualified to be
your pace maker with these times.

75
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,911
I don't like you.

76
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,499
I don't like you.

77
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,710
Why not?

78
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,253
You're uncomfortable.

79
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,307
I like you!

80
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,571
Gosh.

81
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:01,328
I don't expect you to apologize
for breaking in,

82
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,580
but you should at least thank me.

83
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,626
Whatever.

84
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,213
It seems you slept well
thanks to me.

85
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,759
You'll run well thanks to me.

86
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,554
Run well.

87
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,306
Gosh.

88
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,475
Run well.

89
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,853
Run well.

90
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,292
Ji Won. Did you sleep well?

91
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,170
Good job.

92
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,006
Your eyes are shining brightly.

93
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,674
I can expect a good record today.

94
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,011
Yes.

95
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,098
Don't think it means nothing
because it's a university marathon.

96
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,475
The preliminary round for
the national marathon is next month.

97
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,476
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

98
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,730
Run well for the first 25km
and just run for the rest.

99
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,566
Remember to keep your pace steady
for your record.

100
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,567
Yes, sir.

101
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,986
That pacemaker
should've been a senior.

102
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,613
Hey. Coach.

103
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,407
That's making me feel bad.

104
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,329
You're prickly today.
That means you're in good condition.

105
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,289
That's good.

106
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,041
You can do it.

107
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,800
- Good luck, Jin Won.
- Let's go!

108
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,427
Run.

109
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,054
Go.

110
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,599
Will Jin Won recover his record?
He looks good.

111
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,851
He was outstanding
when he was a student,

112
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,645
but ever since he turned 18,

113
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,147
he can barely complete the marathon.

114
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,235
Jin Won is spurring up.

115
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,531
Since it's the beginning, he should
run with the leading group.

116
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,824
If he overdoes it in the beginning,
he'll get tired later.

117
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,213
The moment I spur up alone,
I feel fear.

118
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,304
It's a bright day,

119
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,432
but I feel like...

120
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,686
I'm in the darkness alone.

121
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,358
I hate this feeling.

I told you to study. What exercise?

125
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,087
If you want to exercise,
do something cool.

126
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,047
Like horseback riding or golf.

127
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:03,427
My goodness. How could you run
in an undershirt and short trucks?

128
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,387
It's something you can't do
with your money.

129
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,807
I can do it on my own!

130
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,450
When I started running marathons,

131
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,120
I was proud of making
a decision for my life.

("New High School Record in 16 Years

(1st place Jin Won)

134
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,878
The source of energy at the time...

135
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,006
was my defiance of my father
and bravado.

136

But when I turned 20...

137
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,445
and the real competition
with grow-ups began,

138
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,156
I found running too much.

139

Jin Won's losing speed.

140
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,749
I run out of breath.

to escape from this darkness.

143
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:38,897
Jin Won!

144
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,986
Keep running.

Jin Won.

146
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,323

147

That's good.

148
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,854
Jin Won is passing the 10km mark.

149
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,190
He's stable. He's doing well today.

This is where
the pacemaker's job ends.

152

If you finish half of 42.195km,
it's done.

153

Go, Jin Won.

154
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,467
His body is probably in pain.

155
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,761
Then your body creates endorphins.

156
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,223
After that, you can't easily stop.

157

00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,194
Me? Why would I do that?

168
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,490
- Let's go.
- Where?

169
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,992
To celebrate.

170
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,869
It's the first time you have won
since got into university.

171
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:57,870
No thanks.

172
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,706
Hey. Don't back out
on a day like this.

173
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,083
Every PE major will be there too.

174
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,836
The juniors are already
getting a place.

175
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,088
- Come on. Let's go.
- Juniors?

176
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,383
You punk. Jin Won.
You need to become a human.

177
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,593
Let's go.

178
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,850
- He's here.
- He's here.

179
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,521
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

180
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:29,651
- Jin Won!
- Jin Won!

181
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,530
He finally did it.

182
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,949
Jin Won finally did it.

183
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,121
Praise for Jin Won,
the man of the day.

184
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,998
- That was amazing.
- That was amazing.

185
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:44,875
- Good job.
- Good job.

186
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,753
- Jin Won. Cheers.
- Jin Won. Cheers.

187
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,089
Thank you.

188
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:07,147
- Miha University!
- Miha University!

189
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,317
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

190
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,154
This place is nice.

191
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,907
One more beer, please.

192
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,830
What are you doing?
You need to drink.

193
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,917
Is everyone here?

194
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,215
Oh, your pacemaker
Sang Ha isn't here.

195
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,051
He never comes to a party anyway.

196
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,681
Here.

197
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,352
Jin Won. Run in the national
marathon next month like today.

198
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,729
If you reduce your time
just a little bit more, you'll win.

199
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,398
Take 10,000 dollar prize money,

200
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,400
and let's move to the world.

201
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,568
Cheers.

202
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,361
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

203
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,697
- He's done already.
- Let him sleep.

204
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,532
Who taught you? I did.

205
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,200
You should join the national team.

206
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,912
I feel great today.

207
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,081
Eat up.

208
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,628
Pay with this.

209
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,054
Pay? Jin Won.

210
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,723
Right. Pay...

211
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,059
It's all because I taught him well.
Eat up.

212
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:33,692
You should've learned from me.
You punk.

213
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,936
What's wrong?

214
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,987
What... What are you doing?

215
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,966
I knew it.

216
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,218
You don't know
anything about marathons.

217
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,095
They rubbed against your shirt
and are bleeding now.

218
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,558
That's why you should've
applied vaseline before running...

219
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,184
or put on nipple patches.

220
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,019
Are you here to scold me?

221
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,355
If you're thankful,
just say thank you and leave.

222
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,525
Thank... I'm here to argue.

223
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,027
There are so many things
I want to pick at with you.

224
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,571
Go ahead.

225
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:05,742
First.

226
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,162
I could've run better,
but I couldn't because of you.

227
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,124
I didn't even bring sunglasses,
and it was too sunny.

228
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:13,876
What are you going to do about that?

229
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,794
I'm sorry.

230
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,591
Second, you.

231
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,428
I couldn't focus on running
because of you.

232
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,682
Why? I don't understand
what you're saying.

233
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,314
How come the password to your room
is the same as mine?

234
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,191
91503115.

235
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,109
How can that be a coincidence?

236
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,694
It's nine digits.

237
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,030
How do you know that number?

238
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,616
You told me yourself.

239
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,287
(Plastic)

240
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,300
(Jin Won)

241
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,350
(Jin Won)

242
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,563
You're so hot.

243
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:00,190
You're really handsome.

244
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,360
- Oh, my.
- You'll be a national athlete.

245
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:07,447
Please let me buy you new shoes.

246
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,408
Let's get matching shoes.

247
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,216
I washed them
because they were dirty.

248
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,761
Is it because he's rich?

249
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,306
What a bad temper you have.

250
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,273
Seriously.

251
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:50,199
Who keeps bringing back
these shoes I threw out?

252
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,911
Who is it? Come out.

253
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,372
Hey. Many people like you
in this school.

254
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,416
Maybe someone's trying to
get your attention.

255
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,711
It's a new tactic.

256
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,338
If you like me,

257
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:07,716
you should at least have common
knowledge about marathons.

258
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:12,179
I can't run for more than 500km
with one pair of shoes, you dummy.

259
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,390
Whoever brought these shoes back...

260
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,810
doesn't deserve to like me.

261
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,822
Milk is good for marathons.

262
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,201
I studied this time. Drink a lot.

263
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,915
I brought you milk for two years.

264
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,089
(Congratulations
on your graduation.)

265
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,176
- Let's take a selfie.
- What for?

266
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,386
Let's take one. Get over here.

267
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,637
Get in the picture.

268
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,598
1, 2, 3.

269
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,434
Congratulations on your graduation.

270
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,103
Good job on completing high school.

271
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,981
Why are you following me
to university?

272
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,192
You followed me.

273
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,652
They recruited me.

274
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,613
I got accepted...

275
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,656
before they contacted you.

276
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,242
I got in for body mechanics.

277
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,579
You want to touch
my body that badly?

278
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:01,663
What are you talking about?

279
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:04,166
I'm going to a good school
because I'm smart.

280
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,877
Say you want me to be good
to you at university. Now.

281
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:07,878
Okay.

282
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,675
This will be the last one.

283
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:18,597
(Cheer Up Milk)

284
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,562
Who are you?

285
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,068
I...

286
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,948
I'll be Grade 12 next year.
I'll be using this locker.

287
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,704
You know it's an honor.

288
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,082
It's an honor.

289
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,709
I'll give you everything inside.

290
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:49,920
Really?

291
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:51,839
Thank you.

292
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:55,717
Oh, what's the password by the way?

293
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,219
The password is...

294
00:27:58,887 --> 00:27:59,972
my name.

295
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,349
Hey, junior.

296
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,434
Bye.

297
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,745
I couldn't eat or sleep for days...

298
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,539
to find out the number.

299
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,709
(Jin Won)

300
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,715
(Jin one)

301
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:52,232
(Jin Won)

302
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,070
Then when I typed your name
on my phone,

303
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,656
a number suddenly popped up.

304
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,122
(Jin Won)

305
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:18,091
(Jin Won)

306
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,044
Don't give up.

307
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,547
While I'm resting,
my rivals are running.

308
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:57,548
(While I'm resting,
my rivals are running.)

309
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,551
That's so cool.

310
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:04,680
(Don't give up.)

311
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,223
(While I'm resting,
my rivals are running.)

312
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,101
Why is that the password
to your room?

313
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:11,645
I see.

314
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:14,523
So you get angry
when you're thankful,

315
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,608
and you must get answers
to your questions.

316
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,193
Answer my question.

317
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,571
Why are you using that password?

318
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,450
How much more do I have to explain?

319
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:29,037
Because I liked you.
Because I like you.

320
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,790
I'm going to continue to like you.

321
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,259
You crazy...

322
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:44,928
Gosh.

323
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:48,682
Seriously.

324
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,731
I...

325
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:00,110
I'm letting it go because of
all the milk you gave me.

326
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,450
Seriously.

327
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:49,826
Jin Won.

328
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,288
Jin Won.

329
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,557
(Maha University)

330
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,241
Why do you keep biting your lips
instead of eating?

331
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,285
Me?

332
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:32,995
When did I do that?

333
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:36,915
Oh, Sang Ha. Over here.

334
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,752
- Why did you call him?
- What?

335
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,964
Why didn't you come to Jin Won's
celebration party yesterday?

336
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,340
We all waited for you.

337
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:47,426
Something came up.

338
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,636
Really? Sit down here.
Let's eat together.

339
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:50,637
Okay.

340
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,073
I'll get going first.

341
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,373
Hey. Won.

342
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:53,033
Why do I keep avoiding him?

343
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,790
(Maha University Dormitory)

344
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:15,222
I thought you'd never
come to this room again.

345
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:19,184
You didn't change the password
because you want me to come.

346
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,894
If you don't like me, you change it.

347
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:24,356
I can't sleep
because you made me so curious.

348
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,276
My regular routine is messed up
because of you.

349
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,779
What do you want from me?

350
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:36,952
If there's something I want,

351
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:38,662
are you going to do it for me?

352
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,503
There's nothing I want from you.

353
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,551
I...

354
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:54,803
just want to be next to you.

355
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,183
Please let me run next to you.

356
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,069
Then answer me.

357
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:12,863
You.

358
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,576
How do you run exactly on time?

359
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,086
I have to deliver it in two hours.

360
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,255
I have to deliver it...

361
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:31,590
before people go to school and work.

362
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,635
There's also time to pack milk.

363
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,929
To deliver everything on time,

364
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,889
I have to run 133m per minute.

365
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,100
It's the same as a marathon.

366
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:47,689
Let's go.

367
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:49,775
What? Me too?

368
00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:00,619
2 hours. 133m per minute. Hurry up.

369
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:02,371
And do you see that red house
over there?

370
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,289
Leave two packets of milk there.

371
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,415
Hurry up.

372
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:06,792
- Over there?
- Hurry up. Right now.

373
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,377
Hurry up.

374
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,130
Watch out for the dog.

375
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,102
Where's the last house?

376
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,229
Here.

377
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,482
It's my favorite secret place.

378
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,152
I come here when I'm sad or happy.

379
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:39,783
Thank you. I finished early
thanks to you.

380
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:44,955
Drink up.

381
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,926
I'm sorry.

382
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,221
You made me spill it.

383
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:17,487
Since when did you deliver milk?

384
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,786
After my mom passed away
in an accident.

385
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,789
Since grade nine.

386
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,251
Since then?

387
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,422
Yes. I got a debt
for my mom's hospital bill.

388
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:39,218
I had to work for
my living expenses and tuition.

389
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,269
I don't know my dad.

390
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,733
I have lived with my mom
since I was born.

391
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,784
I enrolled in high school,

392
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,913
but I wasn't sure if I should
keep going or not.

393
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:10,666
Life was tough.

394
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,044
I didn't know what to do.

395
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,136
At the time, I thought about dying.

396
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:29,518
Then...

397
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,145
I saw you running.

398
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,024
You looked cool.

399
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,946
I wanted to give you something,

400
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,448
but I have nothing.

401
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,997
So I gave you leftover milk
after the delivery.

402
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,499
You really liked it.

403
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,304
At the time,

404
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,269
I hated this job.

405
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:18,400
Other kids are doing well
getting money from their parents.

406
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,987
But why do I have to struggle...

407
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,780
to pay off the debt
my parents left behind?

408
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,954
But since you like it,

409
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,541
I was happy.

410
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,421
So I kept doing this.

411
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:46,762
I was nothing,

412
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:51,141
but after I started this,

413
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,436
I became good at running.

414
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,939
I became healthy.

415
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,152
And I followed you to university.

416
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:10,619
Thank you for making me smile.

417
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,165
Thank you...

418
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,335
for helping me live.

419
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:28,637
Do it.

420
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,766
Be my pacemaker.

421
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:40,399
Really?

422
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,988
Jin Won.

423
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,407
- Hey. Get off me.
- I'm really happy.

424
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,992
I'll listen to you well.

425
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,035
I'll be really nice to you.

426
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,412
Hey. Get off me.

427
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:55,247
Hey. Gosh.

428
00:40:57,374 --> 00:41:00,460
Okay. I get it. Get off me.

429
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,713
Thank you. I'll be good.

430
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,047
Get off me.

431
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:12,139
(A month later)

432
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:23,275
How much do I have left?

433
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:24,443
100,000 dollars.

434
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:27,196
Don't be surprised. It was a joke.

435
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,447
You have 10,000 dollars left.

436
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,574
It was 10,000 dollars last month.

437
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,535
It's 10,000 dollars this month.

438
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,455
Because it's a private loan.

439
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:39,249
It was 60,000 dollars for 2 years.

440
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:44,755
Sang Ha.
The boss can't wait anymore.

441
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,924
What are you going to do?

442
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:50,552
Why don't you go work
at the place I told you about...

443
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:52,179
for three months
and get it over with?

444
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,223
Answer me!

445
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,393
Get ready tomorrow.
I'll come and pick you up.

446
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,021
- And answer my call.
- Are you hungry?

447
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,732
Stop eating, you punk. Hurry up.

448
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:06,818
That punk.

449
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,919
Where are you?
Are you out of your mind?

450
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:25,087
Come this instant.

451
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:28,882
Sang Ha. Let's make it easy.

452
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:29,925
I...

453
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:35,013
If you come to me on your own,
no one will be hurt.

454
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:39,184
If I have to go catch you,
you'll be dead.

455
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:41,144
The boss is upset.

456
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,274
(Daily loan guy)

457
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,317
Sang Ha. Over here.

458
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:49,444
Yes.

459
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:51,905
Come here.

460
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,118
Yes.

461
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:01,582
This team will seize
the national marathon competition.

462
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,333
Let's take over the Korean marathon,

463
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,002
and take over the world.

464
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:08,213
- It's hot.
- Hot?

465
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:17,222
Jin Won. You're lucky.

466
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,183
It's a perfect team for you.

467
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,894
The man who controls time,
Go Sang Ha!

468
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,274
Sang Ha. Please take care
of Jin Won.

469
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:31,612
Don't worry. I'll do my job
as a pacemaker.

470
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:33,947
And our one and only girl.

471
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:36,283
The woman who controls muscles.
Hyun.

472
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:39,119
Come on. Call me a body mechanic.

473
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,329
Okay.

474
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:43,332
And listen to me carefully.
It's the most important thing.

475
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:45,876
There's a man who controls
your mental game.

476
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,128
That is Coach Bong.

477
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,550
Then how about a man who brings out
a hidden talent?

478
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:57,262
Coach Bong. There's something
more important.

479
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,765
The man who handles the finance.

480
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,685
While we explore for the marathon,

481
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:05,604
you must buy us a lot of
delicious food.

482
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:13,153
- Meat.
- Eel.

483
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,530
- Meat!
- Eel.

484
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:20,035
Okay. Let's eat both.

485
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:21,995
You know it.

486
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:26,500
And you two must get very close
during this exploration.

487
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,168
Then you'll create the synergy.

488
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,173
Don't worry.

489
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:09,042
Coach Bong. Let's listen
to something else, right?

490
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:23,432
It's not like that.

491
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,484
Let's listen to something else.

492
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:35,903
Other than trot.

493
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:42,701
Take it off.

494
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:44,286
What?

495
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:50,667
I knew it.

496
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,712
You still didn't prepare it
after bleeding so much last time?

497
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,507
Hold it.

498
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,864
Go Sang Ha. Listen to me.

499
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:24,826
You're not here to date.
You're here to exercise.

500
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:27,162
Sure.

501
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:28,830
It's not "sure". Okay.

502
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:30,290
Okay.

503
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,090
You put it on.

504
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:42,344
Hurry up and come out.

505
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:45,138
Okay.

506
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,730
Jin Won. How's your leg muscle?

507
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:55,566
Good.

508
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:06,827
You shouldn't tie your shoes
too tight for the marathon.

509
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:08,912
You have to let your feet breathe.

510
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:10,080
It's different from
a short distance run.

511
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,628
Are you going to run in these?

512
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:19,506
If you run in these,
you'll get hurt, you idiot.

513
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:24,720
Are you worried about Sang Ha?

514
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:27,014
If he gets hurt,
I won't be able to set a record.

515
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,766
They're comfortable
because I'm used to them.

516
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:31,810
I'll buy new pairs
when I go back to Seoul.

517
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,353
Buy a new pair
as soon as you go to Seoul.

518
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,232
Why can't I do this?

519
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,234
No.

520
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,946
Leave enough space
to put two fingers.

521
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:46,033
Why is he so high maintenance?

522
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,869
Maybe you're just bugged by him.

523
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,377
- Are you warmed up?
- Yes.

524
00:47:57,377 --> 00:48:00,255
This is the national marathon
competition course.

525
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:03,467
We're just here to get familiar
with the region, so don't rush.

526
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,593
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:05,677
That's good.

528
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,473
- Follow me.
- Yes.

529
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,142
1, 2.

530
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,730
Now, let's go. Drive.

531
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,108
What?

532
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:23,820
Fine. I'll do it.

533
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,037
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

534
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:34,915
Did I bug you? How much?

535
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:36,124
A lot?

536
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,460
Passing the 8km mark.

537
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,087
From here, it's straight.

538
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:45,092
The wind is blowing from the back.
Let's speed up.

539
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:46,760
- Okay.
- You can do it.

540
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,137
Passing the 20km mark.

541
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:52,766
That's good. Great.

542
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,853
The tower you see in front of you
is the 25km mark.

543
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,563
Sang Ha, you need to help him
up to that point.

544
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:59,273
Coach Bong. I can run more.

545
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,108
You're done here. Good job.

546
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,235
Don't talk, Jin Won.
That will mess up your breathing.

547
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,778
Keep running, Jin Won.

548
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:07,114
Stay here and take a break, Sang Ha.
We'll come back to pick you up.

549
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:10,033
You can do it. Cheer up.

550
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,077
Let's go.

551
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:17,332
Jin Won. It seems you've
over paced yourself.

552
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:20,294
No. It's not even 30km yet.

553
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,838
On the day of the marathon,
you know you have to drink water.

554
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,424
- Cheer up.
- Cheer up.

555
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:27,509
Run. Cheer up.

556
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:29,469
Cheer up.

557
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:37,352
Over here.

558
00:49:46,195 --> 00:49:47,196
Drink up.

559
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:55,621
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

560
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,290
Look.

561
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:01,835
(Cheer Up Milk)

562
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:18,727
Seriously.

563
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,103
(Sauna)

564
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:21,897
It's not bad.

565
00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:25,984
Let me use the soap.

566
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:32,115
I'll go first.

567
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,832
Hey. Are you insane?

568
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:45,712
(Coldwater bath)

569
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:47,631
It's cold.

570
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:49,383
If you go in hot water
after exercising,

571
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:50,801
that will ruin your knees.

572
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:52,678
You need to cool your heated knees.

573
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:01,270
Take this.

574
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:03,397
- I'm sorry.
- You punk.

575
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,648
Stop.

576
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:16,368
You're very ignorant.

577
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,455
I'm having a hard time
because of you.

578
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,377
It's because this is
my first marathon.

579
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:31,466
It's also my first time
liking someone.

580
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,096
It's nice.

581
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,682
You have a broad back.

582
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,602
Don't talk.

583
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,146
Every time you talk,
you sound sad or lewd.

584
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,114
Do you plan to run a marathon?

585
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,117
It seems you can run properly.

586
00:51:58,327 --> 00:51:59,453
No thanks.

587
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:02,414
I'm a short distance runner.
I'm not strong enough,

588
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,041
and I don't have physical endurance.

589
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,543
I even took a bus today.

590
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:10,631
If you run up to the 25km mark,
you get endorphins.

591
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,174
You just never tried it.

592
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:15,552
After that, you can't stop
even if you want to.

593
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:18,597
No, it's perfect right now.

594
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:23,519
I feel like I got the perfect role.

595
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:26,271
Watson next to Holmes.

596
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,565
Buzz next to Woody.

597
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,860
Sang Ha next to Jin Won.

598
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:35,364
Being a pacemaker is perfect for me.

599
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:42,955
It's nice.

600
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:50,879
Ta-da.

601
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,552
You're so inflexible.

602
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,262
Pardon?

603
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:00,472
It's banana milk after a bath.

604
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:02,724
How come you only drink white milk?

605
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:07,104
Don't drink if you don't want to.
Why would you complain?

606
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:08,480
When did I say no?

607
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,440
I'm not giving it to you.
I'm going to drink it all alone.

608
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,234
Give it back.

609
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,915
- We're not here to date.
- We're not here to date.

610
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:28,542
- We're here to exercise.
- We're here to exercise.

611
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:31,336
I know that.

612
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:35,716
Aren't you going to drink?

613
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,532
What do you want from me?

614
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:03,785
What do you mean?

615
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:05,954
You said you like me.

616
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,501
What do you want?

617
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:14,296
Why do you ask?

618
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,092
It bugs me.

619
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:26,642
What I want... What I want...

620
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:32,773
I don't want anything.

621
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:35,901
Do I have to want something?

622
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:41,365
I don't know because
it's my first time liking someone.

623
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:47,621
I have never gotten anything
I want in life.

624
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:55,128
If there's something you want,
you must get it.

625
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:00,509
The person who's more in love
is the weak one.

626
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:02,553
There's nothing I can do.

627
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:09,977
I keep calling

628
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,688
But I can't hear it

629
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,817
Gosh. You even sing
something like you.

630
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,696
Don't think about anything else.
Focus on the next competition.

631
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,031
Yes.

632
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:32,541
I keep calling

633
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,127
- But I can't hear it
- Seriously.

634
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,588
- Are you disobeying me?
- For once

635
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:39,548
- Hold me
- What?

636
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:42,426
Come here. I'll kill you
when I catch you.

637
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,094
I keep calling

638
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:22,674
Oh, Sang Ha.

639
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:25,719
Hi.

640
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:29,515
What's that milk? Is it for me?

641
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,644
Sorry. It's for somebody.

642
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:34,895
I'll get going.

643
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:38,899
Bye.

644
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,279
You scared me.

645
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:47,366
Don't you know the marathon
is tomorrow?

646
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,493
Are you going to deliver milk
even on the day of the marathon?

647
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,954
I told you to quit until it's over.

648
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:54,623
You have to save up your energy
and use it at once.

649
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,553
Drink it. It's really refreshing.

650
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:09,096
Whatever.

651
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:18,856
Gosh.

652
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:27,823
(Physical Therapy Room)

653
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:36,039
I told him to buy shoes,
but he didn't.

654
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,294
Maybe he can't buy them.

655
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:43,380
What?

656
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,841
Hey. You're so selfish.

657
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,260
If you do well on this marathon,
you get wealth and honor...

658
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,803
and accomplish your dream.

659
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:52,014
But what about Sang Ha?

660
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:53,599
You're mean.

661
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:55,809
Sang Ha is alone.

662
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,688
He needs to work to make a living.

663
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,947
(Director Room)

664
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:13,410
I should've signed a contract
with you as a pacemaker.

665
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:15,787
I'm sorry, Sang Ha.
I forgot about it.

666
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:25,005
If you run to 25km within time,
you get 5,000 dollars.

667
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:28,342
Then for every 5km after that,
you'll get incentives.

668
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,219
If you complete it,
you get 10,000 dollars.

669
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,471
What do you think?
Isn't it pretty nice?

670
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:38,519
The foundation already put a seal
on it. You just need to sign it.

671
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,690
If you want, I'll pay you first.

672
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:47,027
No, Coach Bong.

673
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,404
Why not?

674
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,198
Is it too little?

675
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:53,158
Should I tell the foundation
and increase it?

676
00:58:53,408 --> 00:58:57,371
No, this gives me no reason to run.

677
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:00,082
I'm running because I like it.

678
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,211
Thank you for your concern.
I'll get going.

679
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,421
Sang Ha. Sang Ha. Take this...

680
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,923
Hey.

681
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:10,634
Sang Ha. Sang Ha.

682
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:12,094
Hey. Sang Ha...

683
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:30,904
Jin Won. You should take back
the money you gave me.

684
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,409
- Gosh.
- Hey...

685
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:45,002
Just take the money and run for me.
What's the problem?

686
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:48,547
I need the best pacemaker,

687
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:50,674
and you must be the best pacemaker.

688
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,762
My idea of the best marathoner
must focus only on running.

689
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:57,639
This money is for that.

690
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:06,064
You don't know.

691
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,484
Not everyone runs to come in first.

692
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,371
I run for you.

693
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:56,281
You were too mean to Sang Ha.
That was heartless.

694
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,493
You should've just said,
"Isn't it hard?"

695
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,037
That's all you had to say.

696
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:04,748
You were too rational.

697
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,125
Are you some sort of businessman?

698
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:08,961
If someone's hungry, you give food.
If someone needs money,

699
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:10,712
you give money.
What's wrong about that?

700
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:12,464
I gave him what he needed.

701
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,092
You're not honest.

702
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:18,554
You want to help him, but you also
want to keep his pride.

703
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:20,180
So you asked Coach Bong...

704
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,557
and made a foundation?

705
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,892
If you want to keep his pride,

706
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:26,478
just let him do it his way.

707
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:30,148
You've never liked someone before,
have you?

708
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:33,277
What are you talking about?

709
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:36,238
Sang Ha wants your heart.

710
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:39,032
You also like Sang Ha,

711
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:40,742
but something
doesn't feel right, no?

712
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:46,915
It's your job to find what it is.

713
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,418
Then you'll find the solution.

714
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:51,211
Okay?

715
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,590
Think about it.

716
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,051
Seriously.

717
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:04,349
Please let me run this once.

718
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,727
I'll go on my own
after the marathon tomorrow.

719
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,608
Do you get money for running?

720
01:02:13,984 --> 01:02:16,111
- No.
- Look, boy.

721
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,907
Why do you run
when you don't even get any money?

722
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:22,451
Running only makes you hungry.

723
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:24,870
- Dong Gun.
- Yes, boss.

724
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:28,415
Drag him. Don't let him
step on the land...

725
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,167
until he pays everything off.

726
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:32,169
I'll take him to the fish farm.

727
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,004
- Please give me a chance.
- Come on.

728
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:36,798
- Please. Just this once.
- Let's go.

729
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:38,675
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

730
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,552
- Please.
- Hurry up.

731
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:43,180
Wait. What's that?

732
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,104
What?

733
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:53,148
- Hey.
- Hey. Stop him.

734
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,983
- Hey.
- Hey.

735
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:56,985
You punk.

736
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,196
Stay still.

737
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:05,118
(Pacemaker Contract)

738
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:06,745
"Go Sang Ha..."

739
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:10,832
"fulfills his duty as
Jin Won's pacemaker."

740
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:15,063
You've never liked someone before,
have you?

741
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,609
Sang Ha wants your heart.

742
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:23,572
You like Sang Ha too, but
something's uncomfortable, isn't it?

743
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:29,328
It's your job to find what it is.

744
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:31,914
Then you'll find the solution.

745
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:39,922
(Jin Won)

746
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,693
Why do you walk into my room
without permission?

747
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:14,164
You didn't change the password
even though I know it...

748
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:18,377
because you wanted me to come.

749
01:05:19,837 --> 01:05:20,879
Why?

750
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:36,478
It's a lot better than my room.

751
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:48,448
What are you doing?

752
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:52,160
You slept in my room too.

753
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:56,748
I'm going to sleep
in your room tonight.

754
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:00,419
What's wrong with you?

755
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:04,923
You slept like this.

756
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,012
I'm sleeping like this tonight.

757
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:25,277
Bring Jin Won in the contract.

758
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,905
No. Please.

759
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:29,865
The marathon is tomorrow.
Please don't distract him.

760
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:32,534
Please give me a chance.

761
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,912
- Hey. Give me a pen.
- Yes, boss.

762
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:39,750
Sang Ha.

763
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:44,087
You need to sign this.

764
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:53,805
Hey. Grab him.

765
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:55,265
Bring him back.

766
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,522
Your hand. Stay still.

767
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,154
(Pacemaker Contract)

768
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:12,115
Good.

769
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:14,409
As long as you run well,

770
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:17,079
this Jin Won guy will be happy to
have a good record,

771
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:19,623
and we will be happy to get paid.

772
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:23,418
Oh, what if you complete the race?

773
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:25,754
Then you can pay us back at once.

774
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,093
That won't happen.

775
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:37,224
You don't have a choice.

776
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,977
You must run
with everything you have.

777
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:48,235
They say if I buy you shoes,
you run away.

778
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:38,577
Your outfit looks good.

779
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:40,787
Do you feel good?

780
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:42,623
You should've been
nice to me earlier.

781
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,375
Do you want a smack
before the marathon?

782
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:47,294
After the marathon.

783
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:50,797
Thank you in advance.

784
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:53,342
Look at you.

785
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:56,386
Don't feel so pressured.

786
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:58,388
It's your first official marathon.

787
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,985
What if you complete the race?

788
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:14,571
Then you can pay us back at once.

789
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:27,876
- You can do it.
- Run.

790
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:31,380
- Good luck.
- Go.

791
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,549
(Complete the race and pay back.)

792
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,678
- Run.
- Cheer up.

793
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:44,810
I deserve to be your pacemaker
with this, no?

794
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:47,938
This gives me no reason to run.

795
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:50,607
I'm running because I like it.

796
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:54,152
Just take the money and run for me.
What's the problem?

797
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:55,821
You don't know.

798
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:59,283
Not everyone runs to come in first.

799
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:02,953
I just want to be next to you.

800
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,540
Please let me run next to you.

801
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:19,261
Let's go. You can do it.

802
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:21,305
Control your pace.

803
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:26,935
The leading group is passing
the 25km mark.

804
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:29,313
Sang Ha. Well done.
You can come out.

805
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:33,650
What? Sang Ha. What's he doing?

806
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:36,403
- Hey!
- Jin Won...

807
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:40,282
seems to have found his pace
since the last university marathon.

808
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,491
He's doing well today.

809
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:42,576
(National Marathon)

810
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:46,079
Runner 5206 next to Jin Won.

811
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,207
I've never seen him before,
but he's doing well.

812
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,292
Don't push yourself.

813
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:59,468
If you don't complete the race,
I won't get paid.

814
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:04,723
Oh, here's a deal.

815
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:09,978
The marathon regulation says
if someone splashes water...

816
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:11,438
from outside,
that player is eliminated.

817
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:16,527
If you don't complete the race,

818
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:20,155
then we're going to splash water...

819
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,616
on that Jin Won guy.

820
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:25,160
Got it?

821
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:28,914
Sang Ha. Run.

822
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:30,624
Run faster. Hey. Do you see this?

823
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:32,960
- Splash the water.
- Hey. I'm going to splash.

824
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,295
- Hey.
- 5206. Yes. Good job.

825
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:37,130
- That's good.
- Good luck.

826
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:40,217
Good luck.

827
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:41,969
You can do it.

828
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:46,765
They're currently passing
the 40km mark.

829
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,017
As long as there's no twist,

830
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:52,521
5205 Jin Won, 5206 Go Sang Ha,

831
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:56,483
5259 Hwang Young Jo will
take 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

832
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,652
From now, it's a mental game.

833
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:02,781
Why does Jin Won keep looking
at Sang Ha?

834
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:04,908
You have to run at your own pace.

835
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:21,008
There's a picture I imagined.

836
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:24,428
(First place, Jin Won)

837
01:12:52,456 --> 01:12:54,708
Thank you. I was able to do it
thanks to you.

838
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,377
I only did my job.

839
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:01,340
This is your award.

840
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:10,098
If you're going to award me,
give me something else.

841
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:12,851
A kiss?

842
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:15,812
Seriously...

843
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:21,944
Are you okay?

844
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:28,575
I told you not to act up.

845
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,537
That really hurts.

846
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:35,707
Yes. I did it.

847
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:38,836
Gosh. You got me again.

848
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:41,588
- Gosh.
- Idiot.

849
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:53,350
(Complete the race and pay back.)

850
01:13:58,522 --> 01:13:59,857
I just want to be next to you.

851
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,234
Please let me run next to you.

852
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:07,155
Thank you for making me smile.

853
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:09,700
Thank you...

854
01:14:11,076 --> 01:14:12,578
for helping me live.

855
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,209
Please let me run this once.

856
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:20,961
I'll go on my own
after the marathon tomorrow.

857
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,756
- That's right!
- Good job, Sang Ha.

858
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:29,553
I thought about dying.

859
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:33,140
Whatever.

860
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,687
Just take the money and run for me.

861
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:39,730
What's the problem?

862
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:47,237
Whoever comes in, it's a festival
for Mihwa University.

863
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,241
Is it Go Sang Ha or Jin Won?
Is it Jin Won or Go Sang Ha?

864
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:52,951
It's neck and neck.

865
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:57,247
Go Sang Ha looks at him.

866
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:59,416
Go Sang Ha passes him
and keeps running.

867
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,585
Is Jin Won losing?

868
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:02,753
Jin Won.

869
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:05,756
- Is it Jin Won or Go Sang Ha?
- Is it Go Sang Ha or Jin Won?

870
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:07,925
Go Sang Ha...

871
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:09,593
- crosses the finish line.
- He crosses the finish line.

872
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:14,014
Yes, the obscure player
Go Sang Ha...

873
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:15,390
wins.

874
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:18,185
It's the birth
of a rookie marathoner.

875
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:19,937
What an unexpected twist.

876
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:22,397
Sang Ha. My goodness.

877
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:24,650
Good job. Jin Won.

878
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:27,569
My guys. Thank you.

879
01:15:29,613 --> 01:15:30,739

01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:02,873

891
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:19,283
Are we over?

892
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:21,577
Who do you think you are
to end it like this?

893
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,940
It's the end.

894
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:54,359
There's no end.

895

There's no place to go anymore.

896
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,617
When you think it's the end,
that's the new start.

897
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:07,372
But I'm tired.

898
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:16,590
Don't give up.

it continues.

902
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,521
You always show off,

903
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,233
but it's really cool.

904
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:38,570
Jin Won. Wait up.

905
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:40,656
Jin Won.

(Cheer Up Milk)

907
01:20:57,482 --> 01:21:00,360
I'm sad because...

908
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,114
without having time
to look back at my feelings,

909
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:07,409
I have to live my life...

910
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:10,537
as I have done until now.

911
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:49,451
You're a jerk.

912
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:55,249
What?

913
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:58,961
Because I beat you
and came in first?

914
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:02,005
I have to pay off all my debt
to stay next to you.

915
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,973
How can you place first in the world
when you can't even beat me?

916
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:14,017
You're even stupid.

917
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:16,854
Did you think I wouldn't even
celebrate if you win?

918
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:18,522
Did you think I'm that petty?

919
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:20,983
Is that why you changed
the password?

920
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,652
You must always be consistent.

921
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:25,988
You said everything in your heart
until now,

922
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:27,781
but you disappear
when you finally have to?

923
01:22:28,115 --> 01:22:30,951
- Are you trying to drive me crazy?
- You're even worse.

924
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,829
I gave you my heart,

925
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,582
but you tried to give me money.

926
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:40,919
You give your heart because
you expect a heart in return.

927
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:43,881
Why do you act like
you don't understand me?

928
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:45,799
It pressured me...

929
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:49,094
that you liked me so much.

930
01:22:53,307 --> 01:22:55,434
Why would you care about my dream?
It's not your dream.

931
01:22:56,143 --> 01:22:58,061
That made me feel uncomfortable.

932
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:59,980
So what do you want?

933
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:08,906
Don't be my pacemaker.

934
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:10,991
Be my rival.

935
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:13,869
Don't tell me what to do.

936
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,663
You can only love...

937
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:19,833
when you're equal.

938
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:24,505
When you're being yourself,
and when I'm being myself.

939
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:30,469
Love?

940
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:34,306
I'm not sure because
I've never been in love before,

941
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:37,976
but I think this is love.

942
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:49,696
I like you.

943
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:55,452
I love you, Sang Ha.

944
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:01,291
I love you too.

945
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:31,697
What should we do?

946
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:34,575
I'm not sure.

947
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:37,828
I've never been on a date before.
I don't know what to do.

948
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:41,623
It's not like
I've been on one before.

949
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,960
You've never been on a date before?

950
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:46,920
No.

951
01:24:48,714 --> 01:24:50,299
No.

952
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:54,970
I haven't.

953
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:02,853
Jin Won. Why are you so cute?

954
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,648
First, let's walk.

955
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:08,609
Good idea.

956
01:25:27,294 --> 01:25:28,795
Wait.

957
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:31,215
My heart is pounding.

958
01:25:33,592 --> 01:25:35,260
Walking doesn't suit us.

959
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:37,137
Then shall we run?

960
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:49,608
Do you know what's similar about
marathon and love?

961
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:53,987
Once you start, you can't stop.

962
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:59,493
Both marathon and love
make your heart pound.
