1
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,257
(Lee Se Jin)

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,759
(Cheon Seung Ho)

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,771
(Mr. Heart)

4
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,362
(A month later)

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,581
How much do I have left?

6
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,749
100,000 dollars.

7
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,502
Don't be surprised. It was a joke.

8
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,753
You have 10,000 dollars left.

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,880
It was 10,000 dollars last month.

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,842
It's 10,000 dollars this month.

11
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,761
Because it's a private loan.

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,556
It was 60,000 dollars for 2 years.

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,061
Sang Ha.
The boss can't wait anymore.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,230
What are you going to do?

15
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,859
Why don't you go work
at the place I told you about...

16
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,485
for three months
and get it over with?

17
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,529
Answer me!

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,700
Get ready tomorrow.
I'll come and pick you up.

19
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,327
- And answer my call.
- Are you hungry?

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,038
Stop eating, you punk. Hurry up.

21
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,125
That punk.

22
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,225
Where are you?
Are you out of your mind?

23
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,393
Come this instant.

24
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,189
Sang Ha. Let's make it easy.

25
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,231
I...

26
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,320
If you come to me on your own,
no one will be hurt.

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,490
If I have to go catch you,
you'll be dead.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,451
The boss is upset.

29
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,580
(Daily loan guy)

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,624
Sang Ha. Over here.

31
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,751
Yes.

32
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,212
Come here.

33
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,424
Yes.

34
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,888
This team will seize
the national marathon competition.

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,640
Let's take over the Korean marathon,

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,308
and take over the world.

37
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,520
- It's hot.
- Hot?

38
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,529
Jin Won. You're lucky.

39
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,489
It's a perfect team for you.

40
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,200
The man who controls time,
Go Sang Ha!

41
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,580
Sang Ha. Please take care
of Jin Won.

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,918
Don't worry. I'll do my job
as a pacemaker.

43
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,254
And our one and only girl.

44
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,589
The woman who controls muscles.
Hyun.

45
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,425
Come on. Call me a body mechanic.

46
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,635
Okay.

47
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,638
And listen to me carefully.
It's the most important thing.

48
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,182
There's a man who controls
your mental game.

49
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,434
That is Coach Bong.

50
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,857
Then how about a man who brings out
a hidden talent?

51
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,569
Coach Bong. There's something
more important.

52
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,071
The man who handles the finance.

53
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,992
While we explore for the marathon,

54
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,910
you must buy us a lot of
delicious food.

55
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:29,459
- Meat.
- Eel.

56
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,836
- Meat!
- Eel.

57
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,341
Okay. Let's eat both.

58
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,302
You know it.

59
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,806
And you two must get very close
during this exploration.

60
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,474
Then you'll create the synergy.

61
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,479
Don't worry.

62
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,349
Coach Bong. Let's listen
to something else, right?

63
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,738
It's not like that.

64
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,791
Let's listen to something else.

65
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,209
Other than trot.

66
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,007
Take it off.

67
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,592
What?

68
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,974
I knew it.

69
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,018
You still didn't prepare it
after bleeding so much last time?

70
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,813
Hold it.

71
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,171
Go Sang Ha. Listen to me.

72
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,133
You're not here to date.
You're here to exercise.

73
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,468
Sure.

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,137
It's not "sure". Okay.

75
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,597
Okay.

76
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,396
You put it on.

77
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,650
Hurry up and come out.

78
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,445
Okay.

79
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,037
Jin Won. How's your leg muscle?

80
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,872
Good.

81
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,133
You shouldn't tie your shoes
too tight for the marathon.

82
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,219
You have to let your feet breathe.

83
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,386
It's different from
a short distance run.

84
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,935
Are you going to run in these?

85
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,812
If you run in these,
you'll get hurt, you idiot.

86
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,026
Are you worried about Sang Ha?

87
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,320
If he gets hurt,
I won't be able to set a record.

88
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,073
They're comfortable
because I'm used to them.

89
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,116
I'll buy new pairs
when I go back to Seoul.

90
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,660
Buy a new pair
as soon as you go to Seoul.

91
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,539
Why can't I do this?

92
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,541
No.

93
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,253
Leave enough space
to put two fingers.

94
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,339
Why is he so high maintenance?

95
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,175
Maybe you're just bugged by him.

96
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,684
- Are you warmed up?
- Yes.

97
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,562
This is the national marathon
competition course.

98
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,773
We're just here to get familiar
with the region, so don't rush.

99
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:20,899
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:21,984
That's good.

101
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,779
- Follow me.
- Yes.

102
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,448
1, 2.

103
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,036
Now, let's go. Drive.

104
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,415
What?

105
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,127
Fine. I'll do it.

106
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,343
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

107
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,221
Did I bug you? How much?

108
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,431
A lot?

109
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,766
Passing the 8km mark.

110
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,393
From here, it's straight.

111
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,398
The wind is blowing from the back.
Let's speed up.

112
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,066
- Okay.
- You can do it.

113
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,444
Passing the 20km mark.

114
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,072
That's good. Great.

115
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,159
The tower you see in front of you
is the 25km mark.

116
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,869
Sang Ha, you need to help him
up to that point.

117
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,579
Coach Bong. I can run more.

118
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,414
You're done here. Good job.

119
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,541
Don't talk, Jin Won.
That will mess up your breathing.

120
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,084
Keep running, Jin Won.

121
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,420
Stay here and take a break, Sang Ha.
We'll come back to pick you up.

122
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,340
You can do it. Cheer up.

123
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,383
Let's go.

124
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,639
Jin Won. It seems you've
over paced yourself.

125
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,600
No. It's not even 30km yet.

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,144
On the day of the marathon,
you know you have to drink water.

127
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,730
- Cheer up.
- Cheer up.

128
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,815
Run. Cheer up.

129
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,776
Cheer up.

130
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,659
Over here.

131
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,502
Drink up.

132
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,927
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

133
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,596
Look.

134
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,141
(Cheer Up Milk)

135
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,033
Seriously.

136
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,410
(Sauna)

137
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,203
It's not bad.

138
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,291
Let me use the soap.

139
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,422
I'll go first.

140
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,139
Hey. Are you insane?

141
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,019
(Coldwater bath)

142
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,937
It's cold.

143
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,689
If you go in hot water
after exercising,

144
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,107
that will ruin your knees.

145
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,984
You need to cool your heated knees.

146
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,659
Oh, sorry.

147
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,536
Oh, I'm sorry.

148
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,248
(Mr. Heart)
