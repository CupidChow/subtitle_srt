00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,257
(Lee Se Jin)

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,800
(Cheon Seung Ho)

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,771
(Mr. Heart)

4
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,731
What... What are you doing?

5
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,835
I knew it.

6
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,087
You don't know
anything about marathons.

7
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,964
They rubbed against your shirt
and are bleeding now.

8
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,426
That's why you should've
applied vaseline before running...

9
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,053
or put on nipple patches.

10
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,888
Are you here to scold me?

11
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,224
If you're thankful,
just say thank you and leave.

12
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,394
Thank... I'm here to argue.

13
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,896
There are so many things
I want to pick at with you.

14
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,439
Go ahead.

15
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,611
First.

16
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,031
I could've run better,
but I couldn't because of you.

17
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,993
I didn't even bring sunglasses,
and it was too sunny.

18
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,744
What are you going to do about that?

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,663
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,459
Second, you.

21
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,297
I couldn't focus on running
because of you.

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,551
Why? I don't understand
what you're saying.

23
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,183
How come the password to your room
is the same as mine?

24
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,059
91503115.

25
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,978
How can that be a coincidence?

26
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,563
It's nine digits.

27
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,899
How do you know that number?

28
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,484
You told me yourself.

29
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,156
(Plastic)

30
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,169
(Jin Won)

31
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,219
(Jin Won)

32
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,431
You're so hot.

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,059
You're really handsome.

34
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,229
- Oh, my.
- You'll be a national athlete.

35
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,316
Please let me buy you new shoes.

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,277
Let's get matching shoes.

37
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,085
I washed them
because they were dirty.

38
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,630
Is it because he's rich?

39
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,175
What a bad temper you have.

40
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,142
Seriously.

41
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,067
Who keeps bringing back
these shoes I threw out?

42
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,779
Who is it? Come out.

43
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,241
Hey. Many people like you
in this school.

44
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,285
Maybe someone's trying to
get your attention.

45
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,580
It's a new tactic.

46
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,207
If you like me,

47
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,585
you should at least have common
knowledge about marathons.

48
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:16,048
I can't run for more than 500km
with one pair of shoes, you dummy.

49
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,259
Whoever brought these shoes back...

50
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,679
doesn't deserve to like me.

51
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,691
Milk is good for marathons.

52
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,070
I studied this time. Drink a lot.

53
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,784
I brought you milk for two years.

54
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,958
(Congratulations
on your graduation.)

55
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,044
- Let's take a selfie.
- What for?

56
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,255
Let's take one. Get over here.

57
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,506
Get in the picture.

58
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,466
1, 2, 3.

59
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,303
Congratulations on your graduation.

60
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,972
Good job on completing high school.

61
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,850
Why are you following me
to university?

62
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,060
You followed me.

63
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,521
They recruited me.

64
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,481
I got accepted...

65
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,525
before they contacted you.

66
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,111
I got in for body mechanics.

67
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,448
You want to touch
my body that badly?

68
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,532
What are you talking about?

69
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,035
I'm going to a good school
because I'm smart.

70
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,746
Say you want me to be good
to you at university. Now.

71
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,747
Okay.

72
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,544
This will be the last one.

73
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,466
(Cheer Up Milk)

74
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,431
Who are you?

75
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,937
I...

76
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,816
I'll be Grade 12 next year.
I'll be using this locker.

77
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,573
You know it's an honor.

78
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,951
It's an honor.

79
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,578
I'll give you everything inside.

80
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,789
Really?

81
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,707
Thank you.

82
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,586
Oh, what's the password by the way?

83
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,088
The password is...

84
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,841
my name.

85
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,218
Hey, junior.

86
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,303
Bye.

87
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,614
I couldn't eat or sleep for days...

88
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,408
to find out the number.

89
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,578
(Jin Won)

90
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,584
(Jin one)

91
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,101
(Jin Won)

92
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,939
Then when I typed your name
on my phone,

93
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,525
a number suddenly popped up.

94
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,991
(Jin Won)

95
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,960
(Jin Won)

96
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,913
Don't give up.

97
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,415
While I'm resting,
my rivals are running.

98
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,416
(While I'm resting,
my rivals are running.)

99
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,419
That's so cool.

100
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,549
(Don't give up.)

101
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,092
(While I'm resting,
my rivals are running.)

102
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,970
Why is that the password
to your room?

103
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,514
I see.

104
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,392
So you get angry
when you're thankful,

105
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,477
and you must get answers
to your questions.

106
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,062
Answer my question.

107
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,439
Why are you using that password?

108
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,319
How much more do I have to explain?

109
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,906
Because I liked you.
Because I like you.

110
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,659
I'm going to continue to like you.

111
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,501
(Mr. Heart)
