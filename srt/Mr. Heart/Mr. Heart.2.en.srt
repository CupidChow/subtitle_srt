(Mr. Heart)

4
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,832
Ji Won. Did you sleep well?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,710
Good job.

6
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,547
Your eyes are shining brightly.

7
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,215
I can expect a good record today.

8
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,552
Yes.

9
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,639
Don't think it means nothing
because it's a university marathon.

10
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,016
The preliminary round for
the national marathon is next month.

11
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,017
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

12
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,271
Run well for the first 25km
and just run for the rest.

13
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,107
Remember to keep your pace steady
for your record.

14
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,108
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,527
That pacemaker
should've been a senior.

16
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,153
Hey. Coach.

17
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,948
That's making me feel bad.

18
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,870
You're prickly today.
That means you're in good condition.

19
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,830
That's good.

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,582
You can do it.

21
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,341
- Good luck, Jin Won.
- Let's go!

22
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,968
Run.

23
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,595
Go.

24
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,140
Will Jin Won recover his record?
He looks good.

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,392
He was outstanding
when he was a student,

26
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,186
but ever since he turned 18,

27
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,688
he can barely complete the marathon.

28
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,775
Jin Won is spurring up.

29
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,071
Since it's the beginning, he should
run with the leading group.

30
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,365
If he overdoes it in the beginning,
he'll get tired later.

31
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,754
The moment I spur up alone,
I feel fear.

32
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,845
It's a bright day,

33
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,973
but I feel like...

34
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,227
I'm in the darkness alone.

35
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,899
I hate this feeling.

36
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:40,285
(Jin Won in Grade 10)

37
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,913
Take that off right now.

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,916
I told you to study. What exercise?

39
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,628
If you want to exercise,
do something cool.

40
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,588
Like horseback riding or golf.

41
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:55,968
My goodness. How could you run
in an undershirt and short trucks?

42
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,928
It's something you can't do
with your money.

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,348
I can do it on my own!

44
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,991
When I started running marathons,

45
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,661
I was proud of making
a decision for my life.

46
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,705
("New High School Record in 16 Years
by Jin Won from Sang Sang High")

47
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,957
(1st place Jin Won)

48
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,419
The source of energy at the time...

49
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,547
was my defiance of my father
and bravado.

50
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,317
But when I turned 20...

51
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,986
and the real competition
with grow-ups began,

52
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,697
I found running too much.

53
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,703
Jin Won's losing speed.

54
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,290
I run out of breath.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,128
I need a streak of light
to escape from this darkness.

56
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,101
Jin Won!

57
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,438
Jin Won!

58
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,527
Keep running.

59
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,778
Jin Won.

60
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:40,864
Faster.

61
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,045
That's good.

62
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,395
Jin Won is passing the 10km mark.

63
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,730
He's stable. He's doing well today.

64
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,450
(Halfway point)

65
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,287
This is where
the pacemaker's job ends.

66
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:33,458
If you finish half of 42.195km,
it's done.

67
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,627
Go, Jin Won.

68
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,008
His body is probably in pain.

69
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,302
Then your body creates endorphins.

70
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,763
After that, you can't easily stop.

71
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,811
Jin Won. This is where my role ends.

72
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,691
It was probably that day...

73
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,444
when that crazy boy
entered my heart.

74
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,955
Yes! Jin Won!

Thanks to you, I like white milk.

Me?

80
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,441
Wasn't it you who put milk
in my locker since high school?

81
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,735
Me? Why would I do that?

82
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,031
- Let's go.
- Where?

83
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,533
To celebrate.

84

It's the first time you have won
since got into university.

85

No thanks.

Hey. Don't back out
on a day like this.

87

- Juniors?

You punk. Jin Won.
You need to become a human.

91

Let's go.

He finally did it.

Jin Won finally did it.

One more beer, please.

106
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,371
What are you doing?
You need to drink.

107
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,458
Is everyone here?

108
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,756
Oh, your pacemaker
Sang Ha isn't here.

109
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,592
He never comes to a party anyway.

110
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,222
Here.

111
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,893
Jin Won. Run in the national
marathon next month like today.

112
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,270
If you reduce your time
just a little bit more, you'll win.

113
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,939
Take 10,000 dollar prize money,

114
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,941
and let's move to the world.

- Cheers.

- He's done already.
- Let him sleep.

118
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,073
Who taught you? I did.

119
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,741
You should join the national team.

120
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,453
I feel great today.

121
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,622
Eat up.

122
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,169
Pay with this.

123
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,595
Pay? Jin Won.

124
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,264
Right. Pay...

125
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,600
It's all because I taught him well.
Eat up.

126
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:26,233
You should've learned from me.
You punk.

127
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,476
What's wrong?

128
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,528
What... What are you doing?
