(Mr. Heart)

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm going to continue to like you.

5
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:33,951
You crazy...

6
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,620
Gosh.

7
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,374
Seriously.

8
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,422
I...

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,802
I'm letting it go because of
all the milk you gave me.

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,141
Seriously.

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,518
Jin Won.

12
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,980
Jin Won.

(Maha University)

14
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,933
Why do you keep biting your lips
instead of eating?

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,976
Me?

16
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,686
When did I do that?

17
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,607
Oh, Sang Ha. Over here.

18
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,444
- Why did you call him?
- What?

19
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,656
Why didn't you come to Jin Won's
celebration party yesterday?

20
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,032
We all waited for you.

21
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,117
Something came up.

22
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,328
Really? Sit down here.
Let's eat together.

23
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,329
Okay.

24
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,765
I'll get going first.

25
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,065
Hey. Won.

26
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,725
Why do I keep avoiding him?

27
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,481
(Maha University Dormitory)

28
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,914
I thought you'd never
come to this room again.

29
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,876
You didn't change the password
because you want me to come.

30
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,586
If you don't like me, you change it.

31
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,048
I can't sleep
because you made me so curious.

32
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,967
My regular routine is messed up
because of you.

33
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,471
What do you want from me?

34
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,644
If there's something I want,

35
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,354
are you going to do it for me?

36
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,195
There's nothing I want from you.

37
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,243
I...

38
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,495
just want to be next to you.

39
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,874
Please let me run next to you.

40
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,761
Then answer me.

41
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,555
You.

42
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,268
How do you run exactly on time?

43
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,778
I have to deliver it in two hours.

44
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,947
I have to deliver it...

45
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,282
before people go to school and work.

46
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,326
There's also time to pack milk.

47
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,620
To deliver everything on time,

48
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,581
I have to run 133m per minute.

49
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,792
It's the same as a marathon.

50
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,381
Let's go.

51
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,466
What? Me too?

52
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,311
2 hours. 133m per minute. Hurry up.

53
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,062
And do you see that red house
over there?

54
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,981
Leave two packets of milk there.

55
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,107
Hurry up.

56
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,483
- Over there?
- Hurry up. Right now.

57
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,068
Hurry up.

58
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,822
Watch out for the dog.

59
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,793
Where's the last house?

60
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,921
Here.

61
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,174
It's my favorite secret place.

62
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,844
I come here when I'm sad or happy.

63
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,475
Thank you. I finished early
thanks to you.

64
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,647
Drink up.

65
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,618
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,913
You made me spill it.

67
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,179
Since when did you deliver milk?

68
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,478
After my mom passed away
in an accident.

69
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,481
Since grade nine.

70
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,943
Since then?

71
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,114
Yes. I got a debt
for my mom's hospital bill.

72
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,909
I had to work for
my living expenses and tuition.

73
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,961
I don't know my dad.

74
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,425
I have lived with my mom
since I was born.

75
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,475
I enrolled in high school,

76
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,605
but I wasn't sure if I should
keep going or not.

77
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,357
Life was tough.

78
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,736
I didn't know what to do.

79
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,828
At the time, I thought about dying.

80
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,210
Then...

81
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,837
I saw you running.

82
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,716
You looked cool.

83
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,638
I wanted to give you something,

84
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,140
but I have nothing.

85
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,688
So I gave you leftover milk
after the delivery.

86
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,191
You really liked it.

87
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,995
At the time,

88
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,961
I hated this job.

89
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,092
Other kids are doing well
getting money from their parents.

90
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,679
But why do I have to struggle...

91
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,472
to pay off the debt
my parents left behind?

92
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,646
But since you like it,

93
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,233
I was happy.

94
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,113
So I kept doing this.

95
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,453
I was nothing,

96
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,833
but after I started this,

97
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,128
I became good at running.

98
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,630
I became healthy.

99
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,844
And I followed you to university.

100
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,311
Thank you for making me smile.

101
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,857
Thank you...

102
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,027
for helping me live.

103
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,329
Do it.

104
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,458
Be my pacemaker.

105
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,090
Really?

106
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,679
Jin Won.

107
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,098
- Hey. Get off me.
- I'm really happy.

108
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,683
I'll listen to you well.

109
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,727
I'll be really nice to you.

110
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,103
Hey. Get off me.

111
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,939
Hey. Gosh.

112
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,152
Okay. I get it. Get off me.

113
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,404
Thank you. I'll be good.

114
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,739
Get off me.

115
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,076
