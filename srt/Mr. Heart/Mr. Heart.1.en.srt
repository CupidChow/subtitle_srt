(Cheon Seung Ho)

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,854
(Mr. Heart)

4
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,456
The more you think,
the more you can't stop thinking.

5
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,294
I think not thinking is the best.

6
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,381
Stop thinking and go to sleep!

7
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,401
The marathon is tomorrow.

8
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,912
(9 hours before the marathon)

9
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,205
It's today.

10
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,168
Please.

11
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,088
Please let me sleep tonight.

12
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,617

(Cheer Up Milk)

15
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,576
Yes.

16
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,245
Let's sleep like this.

17
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,888
(Go Sang Ha)

18
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:50,374
I was able to sleep at night
after a long time.

19
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,717
(Miha University Dormitory)

20
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,162
You're...

21
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,414
from last time...

22
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,417
Good morning.

23
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,337
Go, Jin Won!

24
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,616
- How was it?
- The time for 5km wasn't bad,

25
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,284
but your pace isn't steady.

26
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,039
Can you show me the lap time per km?

27
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,707
Look.

28
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,462
You totally lost your pace.

29
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,381
To run for the world championship,

30
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,843
you have to run the first 5km
of 25km in 15 minutes.

31
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,054
Even if you go over 15 minutes,
it should be plus-minus 10 seconds.

32
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,682
In 100m, that's 18 seconds.

33
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,227
I'll keep your pace.

34
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,480
Right now, you can't even
complete the marathon.

35
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,690
You punk...

36
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:21,859
Who do you think you are?

37
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,277
Hey.

38
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,321
Your language is too coarse
for your face.

39
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,323
Say hi.

40
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,996
Hello. I'm a freshman PE major.
My name is Go Sang Ha.

41
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,748
How dare you teach your senior?
You're only a freshman.

42
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,210
You can't sleep at night
because your record isn't stable.

43
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,297
Your record gets worse because you
can't sleep. It's a vicious cycle.

44
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,466
So I brought a pace maker for you.

45
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,387
I don't need help when I exercise.

46
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,097
He's really something.

47
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,724
He's slow in short distances,

48
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,767
but he has an amazing skill
for getting in time.

49
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,437
He can make it
in at the exact time he wants.

50
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,397
No thanks. I don't need it.

51
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,149
I said he can help you.

52
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,358
Come on.

53
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,820
Ji Won.

54
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,364
What's the point of having a new
marathon record from high school?

55
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,742
You haven't run properly
since you came to university.

56
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,202
I said no.

57
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,623
How can I use an amateur
as a pace maker?

58
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,047
How dare you block
your senior's way?

59
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,132
Move.

60
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,012
You can test me.

61
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,807
I'll run in at the time you say.

62
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,393
19 seconds?

63
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,272
18 seconds.

64
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,198
Good luck.

65
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,824
Here we go.

66
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,877
Go.

67
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,472
See? I said he's really something.

68
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,101
Sang Ha. Where did he go?

69
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,896
Sang... Sang Ha. You can stop now.

70
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,440
Sang... Hey!

71
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,662
He is amazing.

72
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,879
The track is 100m,
and I ran 400m more. So that's 500m.

73
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,882
If you times that by 18 seconds,
that's 90 seconds.

74
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,678
You'd say it's a coincidence
if I ran only one lap.

75
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,598
This way, you won't say anything.

76
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,269
You should get my help.

77
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,355
I'm qualified to be
your pace maker with these times.

78
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,318
I don't like you.

79
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,907
I don't like you.

80
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,117
Why not?

81
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,660
You're uncomfortable.

82
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,714
I like you!

83
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,978
Gosh.

84
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,735
I don't expect you to apologize
for breaking in,

85
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,987
but you should at least thank me.

86
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,033
Whatever.

87
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,620
It seems you slept well
thanks to me.

88
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,166
You'll run well thanks to me.

89
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,961
Run well.

90
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,713
Gosh.

91
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,882
Run well.

92
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,260
Run well.

93
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,682
(Mr. Heart)
