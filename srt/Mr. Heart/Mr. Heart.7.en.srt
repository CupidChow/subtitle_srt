00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,216
(Lee Se Jin)

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,717
(Cheon Seung Ho)

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,771
(Mr. Heart)

4
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,289
You've never liked someone before,
have you?

5
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,834
Sang Ha wants your heart.

6
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,797
You like Sang Ha too, but
something's uncomfortable, isn't it?

7
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,553
It's your job to find what it is.

8
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,139
Then you'll find the solution.

9
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,147
(Jin Won)

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,919
Why do you walk into my room
without permission?

11
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,389
You didn't change the password
even though I know it...

12
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,602
because you wanted me to come.

13
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,104
Why?

14
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,703
It's a lot better than my room.

15
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,674
What are you doing?

16
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,386
You slept in my room too.

17
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,974
I'm going to sleep
in your room tonight.

18
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,644
What's wrong with you?

19
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,148
You slept like this.

20
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,237
I'm sleeping like this tonight.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,502
Bring Jin Won in the contract.

22
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,130
No. Please.

23
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,090
The marathon is tomorrow.
Please don't distract him.

24
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,759
Please give me a chance.

25
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,137
- Hey. Give me a pen.
- Yes, boss.

26
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,975
Sang Ha.

27
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,313
You need to sign this.

28
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,031
Hey. Grab him.

29
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,490
Bring him back.

30
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,747
Your hand. Stay still.

31
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,379
(Pacemaker Contract)

32
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,341
Good.

33
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,635
As long as you run well,

34
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,304
this Jin Won guy will be happy to
have a good record,

35
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,848
and we will be happy to get paid.

36
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,644
Oh, what if you complete the race?

37
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,979
Then you can pay us back at once.

38
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,318
That won't happen.

39
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,449
You don't have a choice.

40
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,202
You must run
with everything you have.

41
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,460
They said if I buy you shoes,
you will run away.

42
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,802
Your outfit looks good.

43
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,013
Do you feel good?

44
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,848
You should've been
nice to me earlier.

45
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,601
Do you want a smack
before the marathon?

46
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,519
After the marathon.

47
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,023
Thank you in advance.

48
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,567
Look at you.

49
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,612
Don't feel so pressured.

50
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,614
It's your first official marathon.

51
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,211
What if you complete the race?

52
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,796
Then you can pay us back at once.

53
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,101
- You can do it.
- Run.

54
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,605
- Good luck.
- Go.

55
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,774
(Complete the race and pay back.)

56
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,903
- Run.
- Cheer up.

57
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,035
I deserve to be your pacemaker
with this, no?

58
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,163
This gives me no reason to run.

59
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,832
I'm running because I like it.

60
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,378
Just take the money and run for me.
What's the problem?

61
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,046
You don't know.

62
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,508
Not everyone runs to come in first.

63
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,178
I just want to be next to you.

64
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,765
Please let me run next to you.

65
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,486
Let's go. You can do it.

66
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,530
Control your pace.

67
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,160
The leading group is passing
the 25km mark.

68
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,538
Sang Ha. Well done.
You can come out.

69
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,876
What? Sang Ha. What's he doing?

70
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,628
- Hey!
- Jin Won...

71
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,507
seems to have found his pace
since the last university marathon.

72
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,717
He's doing well today.

73
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,801
(National Marathon)

74
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,305
Runner 5206 next to Jin Won.

75
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,432
I've never seen him before,
but he's doing well.

76
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,517
Don't push yourself.

77
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,693
If you don't complete the race,
I won't get paid.

78
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,948
Oh, here's a deal.

79
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,204
The marathon regulation says
if someone splashes water...

80
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,663
from outside,
that player is eliminated.

81
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,752
If you don't complete the race,

82
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,380
then we're going to splash water...

83
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,841
on that Jin Won guy.

84
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,385
Got it?

85
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,139
Sang Ha. Run.

86
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,849
Run faster. Hey. Do you see this?

87
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,185
- Splash the water.
- Hey. I'm going to splash.

88
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,521
- Hey.
- 5206. Yes. Good job.

89
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,356
- That's good.
- Good luck.

90
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,442
Good luck.

91
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,194
You can do it.

92
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,990
They're currently passing
the 40km mark.

93
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,243
As long as there's no twist,

94
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,746
5205 Jin Won, 5206 Go Sang Ha,

95
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,708
5259 Hwang Young Jo will
take 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

96
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,877
From now, it's a mental game.

97
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,006
Why does Jin Won keep looking
at Sang Ha?

98
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,133
You have to run at your own pace.

99
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,233
There's a picture I imagined.

100
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,653
(First place, Jin Won)

101
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,933
Thank you. I was able to do it
thanks to you.

102
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,603
I only did my job.

103
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,565
This is your award.

104
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,324
If you're going to award me,
give me something else.

105
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,076
A kiss?

106
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,038
Seriously...

107
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,169
Are you okay?

108
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,800
I told you not to act up.

109
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,762
That really hurts.

110
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,933
Yes. I did it.

111
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,061
Gosh. You got me again.

112
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,813
- Gosh.
- Idiot.

113
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,575
(Complete the race and pay back.)

114
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,082
I just want to be next to you.

115
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,459
Please let me run next to you.

116
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,381
Thank you for making me smile.

117
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,925
Thank you...

118
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,803
for helping me live.

119
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,434
Please let me run this once.

120
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,186
I'll go on my own
after the marathon tomorrow.

121
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,982
- That's right!
- Good job, Sang Ha.

122
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,778
I thought about dying.

123
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,365
Whatever.

124
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,912
Just take the money and run for me.

125
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,955
What's the problem?

126
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,462
Whoever comes in, it's a festival
for Mihwa University.

127
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,466
Is it Go Sang Ha or Jin Won?
Is it Jin Won or Go Sang Ha?

128
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,177
It's neck and neck.

129
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,472
Go Sang Ha looks at him.

130
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,641
Go Sang Ha passes him
and keeps running.

131
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,810
Is Jin Won losing?

132
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,978
Jin Won.

133
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,981
- Is it Jin Won or Go Sang Ha?
- Is it Go Sang Ha or Jin Won?

134
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,150
Go Sang Ha...

135
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,818
- crosses the finish line.
- He crosses the finish line.

136
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,239
Yes, the obscure player
Go Sang Ha...

137
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,616
wins.

138
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,410
It's the birth
of a rookie marathoner.

139
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,162
What an unexpected twist.

140
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,623
Sang Ha. My goodness.

141
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,875
Good job. Jin Won.

142
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,794
My guys. Thank you.

143
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:35,964
Well done.

144
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,309
(Mr. Heart)

145
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,111
(Complete the race and pay back.)
