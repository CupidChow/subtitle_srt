00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,257
(Lee Se Jin)

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,675
(Cheon Seung Ho)

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,771
(Mr. Heart)

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,483
Take this.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,610
- I'm sorry.
- You punk.

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,861
Stop.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,581
You're very ignorant.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,669
I'm having a hard time
because of you.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,590
It's because this is
my first marathon.

10
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,680
It's also my first time
liking someone.

11
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,309
It's nice.

12
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,895
You have a broad back.

13
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:04,815
Don't talk.

14
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,359
Every time you talk,
you sound sad or lewd.

15
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,327
Do you plan to run a marathon?

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,330
It seems you can run properly.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,666
No thanks.

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,627
I'm a short distance runner.
I'm not strong enough,

19
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,254
and I don't have physical endurance.

20
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,756
I even took a bus today.

21
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,844
If you run up to the 25km mark,
you get endorphins.

22
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,387
You just never tried it.

23
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,765
After that, you can't stop
even if you want to.

24
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,810
No, it's perfect right now.

25
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,732
I feel like I got the perfect role.

26
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,484
Watson next to Holmes.

27
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,778
Buzz next to Woody.

28
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,073
Sang Ha next to Jin Won.

29
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,577
Being a pacemaker is perfect for me.

30
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,168
It's nice.

31
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,092
Ta-da.

32
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,765
You're so inflexible.

33
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,475
Pardon?

34
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,685
It's banana milk after a bath.

35
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,938
How come you only drink white milk?

36
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,317
Don't drink if you don't want to.
Why would you complain?

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,693
When did I say no?

38
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,654
I'm not giving it to you.
I'm going to drink it all alone.

39
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,447
Give it back.

40
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,128
- We're not here to date.
- We're not here to date.

41
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,755
- We're here to exercise.
- We're here to exercise.

42
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,550
I know that.

43
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,929
Aren't you going to drink?

44
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,745
What do you want from me?

45
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,999
What do you mean?

46
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,168
You said you like me.

47
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,714
What do you want?

48
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,509
Why do you ask?

49
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,306
It bugs me.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,855
What I want... What I want...

51
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,986
I don't want anything.

52
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,114
Do I have to want something?

53
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,578
I don't know because
it's my first time liking someone.

54
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,834
I have never gotten anything
I want in life.

55
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,342
If there's something you want,
you must get it.

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,722
The person who's more in love
is the weak one.

57
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,766
There's nothing I can do.

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,190
I keep calling

59
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,901
But I can't hear it

60
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,030
Gosh. You even sing
something like you.

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,909
Don't think about anything else.
Focus on the next competition.

62
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,245
Yes.

63
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,754
I keep calling

64
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,340
- But I can't hear it
- Seriously.

65
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,801
- Are you disobeying me?
- For once

66
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,761
- Hold me
- What?

67
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,639
Come here. I'll kill you
when I catch you.

68
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,307
I keep calling

69
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,888
Oh, Sang Ha.

70
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:48,932
Hi.

71
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,728
What's that milk? Is it for me?

72
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,857
Sorry. It's for somebody.

73
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,108
I'll get going.

74
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,112
Bye.

75
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,492
You scared me.

76
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,579
Don't you know the marathon
is tomorrow?

77
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,706
Are you going to deliver milk
even on the day of the marathon?

78
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,167
I told you to quit until it's over.

79
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,836
You have to save up your energy
and use it at once.

80
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,766
Drink it. It's really refreshing.

81
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,309
Whatever.

82
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,069
Gosh.

83
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,036
(Physical Therapy Room)

84
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,253
I told him to buy shoes,
but he didn't.

85
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,507
Maybe he can't buy them.

86
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,593
What?

87
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,054
Hey. You're so selfish.

88
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,473
If you do well on this marathon,
you get wealth and honor...

89
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,016
and accomplish your dream.

90
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,227
But what about Sang Ha?

91
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,812
You're mean.

92
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,022
Sang Ha is alone.

93
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,901
He needs to work to make a living.

94
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,160
(Director Room)

95
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:36,623
I should've signed a contract
with you as a pacemaker.

96
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,001
I'm sorry, Sang Ha.
I forgot about it.

97
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:48,218
If you run to 25km within time,
you get 5,000 dollars.

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,555
Then for every 5km after that,
you'll get incentives.

99
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,432
If you complete it,
you get 10,000 dollars.

100
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,684
What do you think?
Isn't it pretty nice?

101
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,732
The foundation already put a seal
on it. You just need to sign it.

102
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,904
If you want, I'll pay you first.

103
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,240
No, Coach Bong.

104
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,618
Why not?

105
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,411
Is it too little?

106
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,371
Should I tell the foundation
and increase it?

107
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:20,584
No, this gives me no reason to run.

108
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,295
I'm running because I like it.

109
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,424
Thank you for your concern.
I'll get going.

110
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,635
Sang Ha. Sang Ha. Take this...

111
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,136
Hey.

112
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,847
Sang Ha. Sang Ha.

113
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,307
Hey. Sang Ha...

114
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:54,117
Jin Won. You should take back
the money you gave me.

115
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,622
- Gosh.
- Hey...

116
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,215
Just take the money and run for me.
What's the problem?

117
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,760
I need the best pacemaker,

118
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,887
and you must be the best pacemaker.

119
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,976
My idea of the best marathoner
must focus only on running.

120
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,853
This money is for that.

121
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,278
You don't know.

122
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,698
Not everyone runs to come in first.

123
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,585
I run for you.

124
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,494
You were too mean to Sang Ha.
That was heartless.

125
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,706
You should've just said,
"Isn't it hard?"

126
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,250
That's all you had to say.

127
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,961
You were too rational.

128
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,339
Are you some sort of businessman?

129
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,174
If someone's hungry, you give food.
If someone needs money,

130
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,926
you give money.
What's wrong about that?

131
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,677
I gave him what he needed.

132
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,305
You're not honest.

133
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,767
You want to help him, but you also
want to keep his pride.

134
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,393
So you asked Coach Bong...

135
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,770
and made a foundation?

136
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,105
If you want to keep his pride,

137
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,691
just let him do it his way.

138
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,362
You've never liked someone before,
have you?

139
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,490
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,451
Sang Ha wants your heart.

141
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,246
You also like Sang Ha,

142
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,956
but something
doesn't feel right, no?

143
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,128
It's your job to find what it is.

144
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,631
Then you'll find the solution.

145
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,424
Okay?

146
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,803
Think about it.

147
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,265
Seriously.

148
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,563
Please let me run this once.

149
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,940
I'll go on my own
after the marathon tomorrow.

150
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,821
Do you get money for running?

151
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,324
- No.
- Look, boy.

152
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,120
Why do you run
when you don't even get any money?

153
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,664
Running only makes you hungry.

154
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,083
- Dong Gun.
- Yes, boss.

155
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,628
Drag him. Don't let him
step on the land...

156
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,380
until he pays everything off.

157
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,382
I'll take him to the fish farm.

158
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,217
- Please give me a chance.
- Come on.

159
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,012
- Please. Just this once.
- Let's go.

160
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,889
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

161
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,765
- Please.
- Hurry up.

162
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,393
Wait. What's that?

163
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,318
What?

164
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,361
- Hey.
- Hey. Stop him.

165
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,197
- Hey.
