1
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:26,637
These things I cooked for you,

2
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,349
this will not immediately rot.

3
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:33,729
This won’t immediately spoil.

4
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,314
Just like my hopes for you.

5
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,191
Andeng, Ligaya.

6
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,852
Even in the darkest moment,

7
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:47,699
my hope will always stay,

8
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,556
and it will never falter.

9
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:58,134
Andeng, Ligaya, apologies.

10
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,589
Don't worry, according to the announcement
the electricity will be restored.

11
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,444
Come on. Let's eat.

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,545
There, I want you to taste my adobo.

13
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:13,842
I cooked it for you.

14
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:17,542
There.

15
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:23,860
Come on, go eat.

16
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:27,279
I want you to taste it first.

17
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:39,105
So?

18
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:43,709
How was it? Is it good?

19
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:48,255
It's a bit bland.

20
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,445
It's bland.

21
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,403
Oh wait, I'll add more soy sauce.

22
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:58,675
Andeng...

23
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,039
Andeng.

24
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:04,694
It's you Peter, it's all your fault!

25
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:07,713
- Andeng
- It's all your fault!

26
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:09,197
- You animal!
- Wait, calm down.

27
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:11,011
Hold on Andeng, I'm not Peter.

28
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:12,845
I'm not Peter.

29
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,915
Who are you?

30
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:22,811
I am Carlo, don't you remember me?

31
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:25,086
- Huh?
- I am Carlo.

32
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,591
Who's Carlo?

33
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,201
I don't know you.

34
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:31,653
Andeng...

35
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:34,222
- I don't know you...
- Andeng.

36
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:36,792
- I don't know you!
- Enough, enough.

37
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,277
Shhh... That's enough.

38
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,426
Don't be scared, okay?

39
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:45,568
It's me Carlo,
I'm the one taking care of you.

40
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,040
Andeng enough, calm down.

41
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:51,374
Shhh!

42
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:55,505
It's okay, it's okay.
Let's just pray.

43
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,537
My God,

44
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:01,363
please heal the heart of Andeng.

45
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,701
I will never give up on you.

46
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:08,591
Even at times you can’t
remember me.

47
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,891
That's enough, okay?

48
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:18,558
I can feel your sorrow, Ligaya.

49
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,710
Ma'am.

50
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,796
Even before.

51
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,190
I can feel it.

52
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:26,371
Biscuits?

53
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,160
Ma'am, biscuit.

54
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:50,841
Ligaya's such a poor child.

55
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,033
She's so young,
and yet she's all alone.

56
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:55,585
Do you know who's the
one who deserve our pity?

57
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:56,675
Who?

58
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,320
It's Helena.

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,717
You know, she's in hell,
because she committed suicide.

60
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:04,880
That's why this house
will be full of bad luck.

61
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:08,586
So you, Belen, and your son Carlo
should leave this house.

62
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,585
That mother and daughter
are drowning in debt.

63
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,320
Ligaya won't be able to pay you.

64
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,590
I know, I already asked
Carlo to pack his stuff,

65
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,743
we're just waiting for this
wake to be finished, right Carlo?

66
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:21,475
Here, coffee?

67
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:23,931
Here.

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,719
Ever since Peter,

69
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:38,473
believe it or not,

70
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,651
I wanted to take you away
from the hands of that demon.

71
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,063
Condolences, Ligaya.

72
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:52,986
What now, you're all alone.

73
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,831
Do you want me to live with you?

74
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:00,856
No, I'm okay.

75
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,132
Oh, dear.

76
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:04,144
There are a lot of evil people nowadays.

77
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,055
- I'm really okay.
- Ma'am, coffee.

78
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:20,138
In any case, you might no longer be here
by tomorrow, or the day after.

79
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:24,434
What?

80
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:31,066
You know that your mother owes me
a huge sum of money.

81
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,822
I can take this house
and apply it to her loan.

82
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:47,749
But don't worry, I can
think of another way,

83
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,578
in order for you to pay me.

84
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:54,105
But who am I to do that?

85
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:56,716
I was there.

86
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,416
But I’m not part of your life.

87
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,937
At that time,

88
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:12,190
I know that what you needed is silence.

89
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:16,310
And that’s what I have given you.

90
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,505
Mom, is that you?

91
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,780
That’s all I can do.

92
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,346
Mom?

93
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,467
Why did you leave me?

94
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:42,178
Mom.

95
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,357
Why did you leave me?

96
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:48,364
I don't think I can
make it on my own, Mom.

97
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,495
Carlo, my son.

98
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:08,705
Mother.

99
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,877
Why aren't you dressed yet?

100
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,421
We might not be able to catch the bus.

101
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:17,714
Mother.

102
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,508
I won't be coming with you, just yet.

103
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,099
Huh?

104
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,367
Why?

105
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,571
I'll stay here for now,

106
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:29,089
I'll accompany...

107
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,120
Andeng, Ligaya.

108
00:07:33,391 --> 00:07:34,892
You can't!

109
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,401
Ligaya won't be able
to pay you anyway.

110
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:42,630
She even only paid only a small
part of their debt to me,

111
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,297
and it even came from the wake donations.

112
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,289
Let's go.

113
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,343
Ma, I'll just follow you.

114
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,596
Go ahead.

115
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:54,036
[sighs]

116
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:57,879
Here.

117
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,800
Take care of yourself.

118
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:03,551
Don't neglect yourself.

119
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:06,704
Yes, Ma. Thank you so much.

120
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,367
There, I'll go ahead.

121
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,811
But follow me after, okay?

122
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,204
Yes, ma. Thank you.

123
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:15,563
I'll wait for you there, follow me okay?

124
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:16,798
Yes, ma. I'll follow you.

125
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,840
- Alright, I'll go ahead, take care.
- Yes, Ma. You too, take care.

126
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,236
Yes, Ma. You too, take care.

127
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:23,138
You take care, okay.

128
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:25,156
Bye, Ma.

129
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,865
It's good, right?

130
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,241
Until he disappeared
from your life.

131
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,451
But the curse he brought you
did not disappear.

132
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,853
Every night, different men
used your body.

133
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:14,666
It is as if that’s the only way
to fill your needs.

134
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,669
But who am I to judge you, Ligaya?

135
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,506
You own your body.

136
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:36,175
And here I am.

137
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:39,345
A mere house boy.

138
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,390
But despite that,

139
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,476
I will never leave you.

140
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,207
I’ll wait.

141
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,251
I’ll wait for you.

142
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:06,140
Miss Bebang.

143
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:08,524
Give us more alcohol.

144
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:10,351
Our alcohol is almost gone.

145
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,135
I’m just here. When Carding
attempted to abuse you…

146
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,816
Just list it in my tab,
I don't have money yet.

147
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,954
I'll take care of it, Miss Bebang.

148
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,321
I don't have money, bro.

149
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,255
- Can I have this?
- Why don't you just force her?

150
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:24,242
- What is it?
- She'll all alone in her house.

151
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:28,871
Don't you think if you go there
she'll just spread her legs?

152
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,293
I'll be able to taste you one day, Ligaya.

153
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:36,379
That's right.

154
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:38,888
Cheers.

155
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,157
Hey!

156
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:43,928
Don’t talk about
Andeng, Ligaya that way.

157
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:46,393
- Who's this guy?
- You're being rude.

158
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:49,100
What? Screw you,
who do you think you are?

159
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,116
Mind how you speak.

160
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,854
You're just a house boy, right?

161
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:58,651
As if you don't masturbate in the image
of that prostitute every night.

162
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:02,489
What?

163
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:04,782
You're so nosy.

164
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:08,244
Just go, I might lose my cool.

165
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,913
- Screw you.
- What's going on? Stop that.

166
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,556
I'll call the cops.

167
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:13,737
Weakling!

168
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,103
Don't mind them, Miss Bebang.

169
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,169
Stay there!

170
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:19,322
I'll just take a taste
of your Ma'am Ligaya.

171
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:22,577
Hey bro, where are you going?

172
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,344
Where else, but to taste Ligaya!

173
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:31,203
Ligaya?

174
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:33,144
Ligaya?

175
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,010
Ligaya?

176
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,414
- Who are you?
- Ligaya.

177
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:55,750
Ligaya, just one time!

178
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,037
Just this time.

179
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,794
Get out of here, you're drunk.

180
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,590
I'll pay you, Ligaya.

181
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,778
Don't fight it.

182
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:09,726
I said, I don't want to.

183
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,085
You like this, right?

184
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:14,060
Damn you, you're just a prostitute,
why are you acting out?

185
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,869
I told you, I don't want to.

186
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:17,259
Don't fight it.

187
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:25,630
Hey!

188
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,114
Where are you going?

189
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,681
Stay here.

190
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:31,770
Stop resisting!

191
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,351
Stop it.

192
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,426
Don't resist!

193
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,391
I've been waiting for this
for so long, Ligaya.

194
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:56,852
Come here.

195
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,416
- Stop it.
- Shh!

196
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,519
I told you, to shut up, right?

197
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,789
Why won't you listen to me?

198
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:33,022
Hey, you son of a bitch.

199
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,684
Screw you, who do
you think you are?

200
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:41,355
Screw you.

201
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:42,857
Asshole!

202
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,282
Damn you!

203
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,847
Help!

204
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:51,447
Stand up, asshole!

205
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:52,909
Son of a bitch!

206
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:56,450
Enough, I give up. Stop.

207
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,252
Ligaya, are you okay?

208
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:04,754
Are you okay?

209
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,046
Ligaya.

210
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:32,072
Are you okay?

211
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,203
Are you okay?

212
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,247
Does it hurt?

213
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:48,770
It hurts.

214
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,678
Thank you, Sir.

215
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:01,971
Don't worry about it.
Just call me Andrew.

216
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,137
Thank you, Andrew.

217
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:10,069
Ligaya, I'm Ligaya.

218
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,151
Do you live alone in this house?

219
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:16,885
Where are your parents?

220
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,747
They are both gone.

221
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:24,460
My father.

222
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,459
He died three years ago.

223
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:30,673
While my mother.

224
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,467
She passed away last month.

225
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,137
I'm sorry.

226
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,519
It's okay, that's life.

227
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,032
That's why you're all alone.

228
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:04,304
You might need someone
to accompany you in this house?

229
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:08,460
You know, there are a lot
of evil people nowadays.

230
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,669
I can protect you.

231
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:21,265
I can do that.

232
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,323
Huh?

233
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,105
Only if you want to,

234
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:34,945
I can protect you,

235
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,239
night and day.

236
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:22,553
Are you denying there's
nothing going on between you two?

237
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:25,764
- You're the one  being malicious.
- What?

238
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:26,797
Huh?

239
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:28,600
It's all in your head.

240
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:32,676
- Don't make it about me.
- Yes, it's you!

241
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:35,155
You are so malicious!

242
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,600
We're just talking.

243
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:41,358
Talking?

244
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:46,493
Why is that her fingers,
her hands,

245
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,342
is inside your pants?

246
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:50,941
Why?

247
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:52,827
You're crazy, Ligaya.

248
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:57,796
Me? Crazy?

249
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:01,734
Who between us have
a mother who killed herself,

250
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,394
because of insanity?

251
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,054
You bitch!

252
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,222
- What?
- Get out of here.

253
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,200
- You're just like your crazy mother.
- Leave!

254
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:12,269
Leave! Leave now!

255
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:14,698
Damn you!

256
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:17,624
- Why?
- Leave now!

257
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,193
Damn you,

258
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:20,502
if you ask me to leave,

259
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,072
you'll go back to being
a prostitute? Huh?

260
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:27,676
It's better than,
being a useless like you!

261
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,733
- What did you say?
- You're just a lazy bum,

262
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,388
despite having huge body.

263
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:32,675
What did you say?

264
00:24:33,957 --> 00:24:35,853
Huh? What did you say?

265
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,148
Be thankful, I'm kind, Ligaya.

266
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,814
Let it be.

267
00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:43,058
It's our mess.

268
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,086
I'll be the one to fix it.

269
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,076
When Andrew hurt you.

270
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:52,661
I was there.

271
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,054
But what really is my role,

272
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,534
if in those moments,

273
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:01,420
I was there,

274
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,049
but I can’t do anything.

275
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:23,817
There's someone.

276
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,201
There's someone.

277
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,203
There's someone.

278
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:36,455
There's someone. There!

279
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:39,291
- There's someone there!
- Andeng, Ligaya.

280
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:42,294
- No, there's no one there.
- There's someone!

281
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,987
Shh. No one's there.

282
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,048
- There's no one.
- Andrew!

283
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:51,839
You came back.

284
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,890
Ouch!

285
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:00,287
It's okay.

286
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:02,648
Carlo's here.

287
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:07,486
I can't take it anymore,
I want to die.

288
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,571
I'm tired of all this.

289
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,758
I want to die, I don't want live anymore.

290
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:14,605
- I'm tired of this.
- It's okay.

291
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:21,333
But I don't want to
be like my mother.

292
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,628
Her soul is burning in hell.

293
00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:29,591
No.

294
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,512
You're not like your mother.

295
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:37,766
The gods might have cursed me.

296
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:44,314
No, no, listen to me.

297
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:50,570
I did not respect my body,

298
00:27:52,614 --> 00:28:00,372
that's why I deserve all this pain,

299
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:02,874
for a very long time. Ouch.

300
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:04,539
Enough.

301
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,503
You're not cursed.

302
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:08,088
You're not cursed.

303
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,610
Listen to me, okay?

304
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,665
Listen to Carlo.

305
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,960
You're not cursed, Andeng, Ligaya.

306
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,848
Okay? Listen to Carlo.

307
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,017
You're not cursed.

308
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,727
You're not cursed.

309
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,107
Enough.

310
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:28,567
That's enough, okay?

311
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:34,199
I'm hungry.

312
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:41,955
Andrew, I'm hungry.

313
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,628
The people are saying, he ate pork

314
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,397
but the pork has,

315
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:54,092
what was that,
mouth and eyes disease?

316
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:56,428
That's why he died.

317
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:59,164
- That's why I don't want to eat meat.
- What are you saying?

318
00:28:59,189 --> 00:29:00,482
Fake news.

319
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:03,761
Why fake news?
That's what they've been saying.

320
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,829
This is actually what happened,
his daughter, Jeferlyn,

321
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:11,234
she's the one who placed
rat poison on the adobo he ate.

322
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:13,295
That's why Mang Lito got poisoned.

323
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:14,322
Really?

324
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:17,240
How can it be an accident?
She thought it's salt?

325
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,761
It's because, his daughter
wants to get her inheritance,

326
00:29:20,786 --> 00:29:23,794
you know it's all about the money.

327
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:24,941
My goodness.

328
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:28,810
He might buy some chicken.

329
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,568
He's getting chicken.

330
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:33,715
Maybe, you just don't
have the money to buy the meat?

331
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:36,760
Bro, are you okay?

332
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:39,596
Don't believe these two,
they're just spreading fake news.

333
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:41,076
- Just ignore them.
- Geez...

334
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,408
For now I won't buy pork meat.

335
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,976
- I'll just eat vegetable.
- Right.

336
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:46,819
Moron.

337
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,623
Just like always, two kilos.

338
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:53,402
Oh, I got you. Here.

339
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:58,156
Here bro, I placed extra meat.

340
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:03,764
The extra meat is
for your Ma'am Ligaya.

341
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:04,836
Here you go.

342
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,265
- Thank you, Bro.
- By the way,

343
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:11,384
I've heard that Ma'am Ligaya
is getting worse.

344
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:16,800
It seems like she has some illness,
what was that, Alzheimer?

345
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,743
It's like an old one acting like a child.

346
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,095
Something like that.

347
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:23,723
Oh, bro.

348
00:30:23,748 --> 00:30:25,083
I've also heard...

349
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,695
Dude.

350
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:30,230
She has a lot of money on her.

351
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,623
That's all cash.

352
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:35,694
The money she earned
when she was a prostitute.

353
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:41,199
Here's the thing,
why don't we divide it between us?

354
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:44,761
Seventy-thirty? I'll get the
seventy percent, you get the thirty?

355
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:46,246
No thanks bro,
I still have much to do.

356
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:48,231
Hold on, dude. Wait up.

357
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,958
How about this,

358
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,751
let's do sixty-forty?

359
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:53,361
You'll get sixty percent,
I'll get forty percent,

360
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,256
plus I'll give you a kilo of meat?

361
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,467
Are we good? Is it a maybe?

362
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,218
- No thanks.
- Hold on!

363
00:31:00,243 --> 00:31:02,912
I'll make it two kilos?

364
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,390
What do you think?
Are we good?

365
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:08,435
How about this,

366
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:11,271
just so it's fair to you.

367
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:14,149
Fifty-fifty, let's share it like brothers?

368
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,860
I'll go ahead,
I really still have much to do.

369
00:31:16,885 --> 00:31:19,930
Hold on, stay here for a while.

370
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:22,760
Maybe, you have a crush on her?

371
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,759
What's up with you?
She's already forgetful.

372
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:27,412
And she's full of wrinkles,
she's too old, bro!

373
00:31:27,412 --> 00:31:29,873
Let her go, there's a
lot of younger girls here.

374
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:31,816
They are still fresh.

375
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,822
- Just pick one of them.
- What's wrong with you?

376
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:38,673
Bro wait, I'm giving you
a really good deal.

377
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:40,945
Come back here, bro.

378
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:54,360
Andeng, Ligaya.

379
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:57,776
Just wait for what I'm cooking.

380
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:02,447
You know what, I've actually
studied cooking this just for you.

381
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,548
You might like it.

382
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:09,621
You might think it's good,
and hopefully,

383
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,332
you remember my name.

384
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:18,922
It smells like ginger,

385
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:25,679
there's fish sauce.

386
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:29,766
pepper,

387
00:32:34,104 --> 00:32:35,397
and lemon grass, too.

388
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:46,449
I won't forget it.

389
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,083
Andeng.

390
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:00,380
Go on.

391
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,965
Taste it.

392
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,533
Can you remember me now?

393
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:27,701
Every ingredient,

394
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:32,954
goes with your every poem.

395
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:37,917
Joel?

396
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:56,721
You were that ingredient,
that I was looking for,

397
00:33:58,271 --> 00:33:59,816
which can give color,

398
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:02,981
in my cruel life.

399
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:07,790
And now, it’s Joel.

400
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,189
The kindest one.

401
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:13,370
The one with sweetest words.

402
00:34:14,757 --> 00:34:15,766
Like you,

403
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,458
I thought he’s the one,

404
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:19,932
I wished...

405
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:22,504
he’s the one for you, Ligaya.

406
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:53,298
You're the rose, that blooms.

407
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,749
Start your love,

408
00:34:57,414 --> 00:34:59,749
is the fragrance
that I cannot refuse.

409
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:02,961
It flows with the wind,

410
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,341
just like a flower in
the morning breeze.

411
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,096
Let's live together,

412
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:57,348
you can stay here.

413
00:35:57,849 --> 00:35:59,517
We're okay, like this.

414
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,563
You know that there are
a lot of people looking for me, right?

415
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,648
There are a lot of threats.

416
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:08,401
It's dangerous to
love me for a long time.

417
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,988
I can do it.

418
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:36,640
Did you like it?

419
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:39,390
We both know you're good.

420
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:41,100
Good at what?

421
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,812
With words.

422
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:46,564
With those luscious words.

423
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,359
It's sweet.

424
00:36:50,902 --> 00:36:52,570
Its so sweet.

425
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:56,366
My words used to be spicy.

426
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:02,455
But since we've removed the president,

427
00:37:03,414 --> 00:37:05,375
it turned sweet.

428
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,087
Especially when I met you.

429
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:14,692
Hey, you whore!
You both are animals!

430
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:16,094
Damn you.

431
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:18,930
- You, whore, you are such bitch!
- Ma'am, that's enough!

432
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:20,698
How dare you, bitch!

433
00:37:20,723 --> 00:37:23,476
Don't you know he's already married?

434
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:24,870
- Damn you!
- Ma'am!

435
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:26,796
You whore!

436
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,531
- You have no idea!
- Stop it, ma'am!

437
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:29,849
Hold on, who are you?

438
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,377
Who am I? I'm his wife!

439
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:34,540
Damn you, I'm Joel's wife!

440
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:35,613
You bitch!

441
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:37,841
That's enough!
Stop hurting Ligaya!

442
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,367
You're ruining my family.

443
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:41,536
Don't you know we
already have three kids?

444
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:42,662
Such a whore.

445
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:44,330
- Stop it!
- Ma'am, stop!

446
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,373
Lisa, stop it.

447
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:46,749
- Damn bitch!
- Liza, that's enough!

448
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:48,067
You're a prostitute.

449
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:50,094
- Let go of me!
- Enough, already!

450
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,480
- You're a whore!
- Liza!

451
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:54,090
- Ma'am that's enough.
- Stop it.

452
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,633
Ma'am, stop it, you're hurting someone,

453
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,051
don't hurt, Ligaya, Ma'am.

454
00:37:57,051 --> 00:37:59,053
- That's enough.
- Let's settle this at home.

455
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:01,973
We will not talk at home,
let's settle it here.

456
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,618
You can't do this to me!

457
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:06,936
You bitch!

458
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:10,273
Ligaya?

459
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:12,233
Ligaya.

460
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,694
Are you okay?
How are you?

461
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,498
Why is that despite the large number
of men you chose to be with you,

462
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:21,159
why can’t I be one of them?

463
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:26,789
Do I need to be like them
for you to choose me?

464
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,835
Andeng?

465
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:33,296
Andeng Ligaya?

466
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,627
Carlo.

467
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,674
Andeng.

468
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:41,435
Here.

469
00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:43,431
Is this from Joel?

470
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,975
But unlike them,

471
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:49,103
I’d rather choose to stay this way,

472
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:51,564
to stay with you,

473
00:38:53,691 --> 00:38:55,318
My love,

474
00:38:56,486 --> 00:38:59,697
even in the absence of the sun,

475
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:03,826
I am longing for the eventual
spring of the beautiful roses.

476
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:17,006
Thank you for giving
me the letter of Joel.

477
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:30,395
They left me again.

478
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,199
They always leave me.

479
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,259
Where have you been?

480
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:07,853
I said, where have you been?

481
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,641
Oh!

482
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:15,023
You got in to a brawl again?

483
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:19,360
How many times do I
have to tell you to stop it?

484
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:23,322
I've been waiting for you, Andrew.

485
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:28,352
Andrew?

486
00:40:29,996 --> 00:40:31,237
It's Andrew again?

487
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,561
Hold on, where are you going?

488
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:38,688
Are you going to leave me again,

489
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:39,839
because you're scared?

490
00:40:39,864 --> 00:40:41,507
Then what? You'll hurt me?

491
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:44,093
Then you're just going to leave me
behind just like that, Andrew.

492
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:45,578
Stop it, Andeng.

493
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:49,432
Can you please,

494
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:54,520
never call me names
that aren't mine,

495
00:40:55,855 --> 00:40:58,399
Don't ever call me...

496
00:40:58,733 --> 00:40:59,942
a coward!

497
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:04,781
Don't ever tell me that I'll hurt you.

498
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,507
and that I'll leave you.

499
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:09,176
Because it's just me.

500
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,576
It's just me who
never treated you that way!

501
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:18,127
Do you even know
where I have been?

502
00:41:20,503 --> 00:41:22,732
No one can hurt Ligaya!

503
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:23,883
Remember that!

504
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:28,221
I defended you,
just like what I always do.

505
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,918
Enough!

506
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:34,638
Enough!

507
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,531
You won't remember
anything I did for you,

508
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,868
because not one bit
you see any of those.

509
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:53,518
Ligaya's such a poor child.

510
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,790
She's so young,
and yet she's all alone.

511
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,975
That's why this house
will be full of bad luck.

512
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,922
You know, she's in hell,
because she committed suicide.

513
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:06,648
Here's some coffee.

514
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,317
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

515
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:12,140
Why is this so sweet?

516
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:15,100
But what am I really to you, Ligaya?

517
00:42:16,686 --> 00:42:19,981
I didn't have the
courage to defend you

518
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:22,300
against those abusing your womanhood.

519
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:26,404
When they are trying
to slowly remove your dignity.

520
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:31,367
If I can only break every bone
in the hand of that

521
00:42:31,392 --> 00:42:34,020
maniac which slowly
moves around your body.

522
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,574
I'm weak, Ligaya.

523
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,623
I'm sorry, sir!

524
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:38,765
- But I cannot.
- What the hell?

525
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,138
I'm sorry.

526
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:41,752
- Step aside.
- I'm weak.

527
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:49,969
Let them be, Miss Bebang.

528
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:51,679
Stay there!

529
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:53,998
I'll just take a taste
of your Ma'am Ligaya.

530
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,185
Hey, where are you going?

531
00:42:57,351 --> 00:43:00,104
Where else, but to taste Ligaya.

532
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:15,831
Hey, what happened to you?

533
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:19,165
- Are you okay?
- Ouch.

534
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,668
Sir...

535
00:43:23,808 --> 00:43:25,564
- What is it?
- Sir...

536
00:43:29,008 --> 00:43:30,509
Sir, help me.

537
00:43:31,177 --> 00:43:33,012
What help?

538
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:36,474
That guy over there.

539
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:40,519
He's planning to do
something evil against my boss.

540
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:44,106
I'm sorry I need to be somewhere.

541
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:45,775
I'm sorry.

542
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,069
Sir, help me please!

543
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:51,030
Here sir, take my money.

544
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:52,527
Take this.

545
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,336
That's all yours.

546
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:56,244
Just help me, sir.

547
00:43:56,786 --> 00:43:58,621
Just help my boss.

548
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:01,916
Sir please.

549
00:44:04,486 --> 00:44:05,511
Alright.

550
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:06,837
I'll take care of it.

551
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:09,023
I got this.

552
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:10,172
Go ahead, sir.

553
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:18,015
Even if I'm not the
one who saved you,

554
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:21,936
and it's not my arms
which helped you,

555
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:26,983
I'm contented to know that
you're saved from such great danger.

556
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,245
Are you denying there's
nothing going on between you two?

557
00:44:39,495 --> 00:44:42,123
You're the one being malicious.

558
00:44:43,124 --> 00:44:44,667
It's all in your head.

559
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,294
We're just talking!

560
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:48,921
Talking?

561
00:44:49,297 --> 00:44:51,549
Who between us have
a mother who killed herself,

562
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:53,422
Even if I wanted to help you, Ligaya,

563
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,722
You're crazy!

564
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,252
- I cannot.
- Damn you!

565
00:44:56,692 --> 00:44:57,692
What?

566
00:44:57,847 --> 00:44:59,015
I'm such a coward.

567
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:01,200
- Leave!
- I'm weak.

568
00:45:01,225 --> 00:45:03,846
Stupid, and useless.

569
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:08,607
Damn you, if you ask me to leave,

570
00:45:08,816 --> 00:45:11,235
you'll go back to being a prostitute.

571
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:16,820
Be thankful, I'm kind, Ligaya.

572
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:07,516
Joel, Joel, get out here.

573
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,377
- Ma'am?
- Show me your other girl.

574
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:10,694
- Ma'am, what is it?
- Joel?

575
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:13,506
- Show me that girl, where are you?
- What is it, ma'am?

576
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:15,383
I saw my husband, entering here,

577
00:46:15,408 --> 00:46:17,166
is her mistress up stairs?

578
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,151
I saw my husband upstairs!

579
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,846
He's with his other girl!

580
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:22,498
Let me go!

581
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,808
Let go of me!

582
00:46:23,808 --> 00:46:25,434
I cannot calm down,

583
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:28,379
my husband is there,
and he has another girl.

584
00:46:29,147 --> 00:46:32,149
I said let me go,
why are you stopping me?

585
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:33,567
This cannot happen.

586
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,473
- Let me go!
- Calm down, ma'am.

587
00:46:36,987 --> 00:46:38,364
Let me go.

588
00:46:38,948 --> 00:46:39,985
Calm down.

589
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:41,492
This cannot happen.

590
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:44,412
This is the reason why
my husband has been neglecting me,

591
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,414
it's because he has another woman.

592
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:47,857
Ma'am, calm down.

593
00:46:49,022 --> 00:46:50,440
Calm down.

594
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:52,670
It might just be your paranoia.

595
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,258
I'm crazy too, ma'am.

596
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:03,774
What is it that's wrong with me?

597
00:47:04,007 --> 00:47:05,464
Is there something wrong with me?

598
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:11,063
Why does it seem like
he cannot see me?

599
00:47:12,815 --> 00:47:14,733
Why doesn’t he love me?

600
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:17,998
Stop crying, ma'am.

601
00:47:18,404 --> 00:47:19,488
That's enough.

602
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,741
Go get some rest.

603
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:26,412
To be honest.

604
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:30,624
nothing is wrong with you.

605
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:32,995
So stop crying.

606
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,255
take a rest.

607
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:46,532
Ma'am, no.

608
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:47,808
- Don't.
- Why?

609
00:47:48,017 --> 00:47:49,643
If he can cheat on me,

610
00:47:49,668 --> 00:47:50,878
I can also do it.

611
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:25,281
Ma'am, this is wrong.

612
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:27,324
What do you mean?

613
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:30,553
You son of a bitch!
Are you just distracting me?

614
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:32,280
Ma'am, this is really wrong.

615
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,601
- Joel!
- Ma'am, hold on!

616
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:38,651
Joel?

617
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,379
- Stop that, ma'am!
- Liza!

618
00:49:40,379 --> 00:49:41,672
You bitch!

619
00:49:41,697 --> 00:49:42,990
You're a prostitute.

620
00:49:43,257 --> 00:49:45,259
- Let go of me!
- Enough, already!

621
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:47,553
- You're a whore!
- Liza!

622
00:49:47,553 --> 00:49:49,138
- Ma'am, that's enough.
- Stop it.

623
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:50,681
Ma'am, stop it, you're hurting someone,

624
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:52,099
don't hurt, Ligaya, Ma'am.

625
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:54,101
- That's enough.
- Let's settle this at home.

626
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:57,021
We will not talk at home,
let's settle it here.

627
00:49:57,804 --> 00:49:59,070
Stop it!

628
00:49:59,095 --> 00:50:00,639
You can't do this to me!

629
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:01,930
You bitch!

630
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:04,295
Let me go!

631
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,321
Ligaya?

632
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:07,353
Ligaya.

633
00:50:07,615 --> 00:50:08,741
Are you okay?

634
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:11,493
How are you?
Are you feeling any pain?

635
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:12,953
How are you?

636
00:50:13,412 --> 00:50:14,330
Are you okay?

637
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:19,612
I'm the only one that...

638
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:22,427
you don't see.

639
00:50:25,716 --> 00:50:27,890
I'm the only one you can't recognize,

640
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,111
and I'm the only one
you cannot remember.

641
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,070
the times when I left home,

642
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:51,825
my mother saw me
in front of you house.

643
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:56,330
And even before I entered your gate,

644
00:50:57,748 --> 00:50:59,209
she wanted me to go home,

645
00:51:01,627 --> 00:51:03,337
she said it's embarrassing.

646
00:51:07,841 --> 00:51:09,301
If you think about it,

647
00:51:11,887 --> 00:51:13,197
even your mother

648
00:51:15,392 --> 00:51:16,849
she wants me to go home,

649
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:23,271
but I saw you,

650
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:26,991
I saw you, Ligaya,

651
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,947
you helped your mother,

652
00:51:31,657 --> 00:51:33,117
and since then,

653
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:36,412
she allowed me to work here.

654
00:51:37,538 --> 00:51:40,958
I will never forget that, Andeng Ligaya.

655
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:45,430
Because, every moment

656
00:51:46,547 --> 00:51:48,127
I see you,

657
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,002
that's what I remember,

658
00:51:54,596 --> 00:51:59,017
because of that small thing you did,

659
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:02,271
my life turned for the better.

660
00:52:03,605 --> 00:52:09,126
That's why, if there's
something I can fix for you,

661
00:52:12,414 --> 00:52:17,241
I will fix it, Andeng Ligaya.

662
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:40,601
My beloved Ligaya,

663
00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:43,937
Each time I see you…

664
00:52:44,646 --> 00:52:48,567
Behind the suffering carried
by the tears in your eyes,

665
00:52:53,322 --> 00:52:56,658
I glimpse the woman
who longs only to smile—

666
00:52:57,409 --> 00:52:59,870
to know, even just once,

667
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:03,273
the true meaning of her name.

668
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:08,188
Perhaps not today,

669
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,732
perhaps you cannot see it yet,

670
00:54:11,608 --> 00:54:13,026
but I know,

671
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:15,779
someday, you will awaken to it.

672
00:55:13,462 --> 00:55:15,464
And when that day comes,

673
00:55:16,673 --> 00:55:18,759
may your heart hold fast.

674
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:21,845
Not to what I have done,

675
00:55:23,472 --> 00:55:25,724
not to the words I have spoken,

676
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,810
but only to my name,

677
00:55:29,937 --> 00:55:32,314
forever bound with yours…
with Ligaya.

678
00:55:50,207 --> 00:55:53,961
Ouch, ouch!

679
00:55:53,961 --> 00:55:55,982
What's happening?

680
00:55:56,007 --> 00:55:57,133
It hurts!

681
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:58,443
What's painful?

682
00:56:01,301 --> 00:56:02,928
My love,

683
00:56:03,428 --> 00:56:07,015
even in the absence of the sun,

684
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:12,854
I am longing for the eventual
spring of the beautiful roses.

685
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:17,025
With love, Joel.

686
00:56:32,082 --> 00:56:33,166
Carlo?

687
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,127
Andeng!

688
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:40,620
I was left behind again.

689
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:50,532
I always get left behind.

690
00:56:57,478 --> 00:56:58,963
I just closed my eyes,

691
00:57:00,861 --> 00:57:02,752
and they're gone.

692
00:57:11,163 --> 00:57:12,624
I'm stupid.

693
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:20,722
I'm so stupid.

694
00:57:30,474 --> 00:57:36,189
Those who turn blind eyes are more stupid,

695
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,956
than those who really are blinded,

696
00:57:43,737 --> 00:57:45,197
such as when,

697
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:50,077
you force yourself to look,

698
00:57:51,453 --> 00:57:52,913
even if it hurts you.

699
00:58:43,713 --> 00:58:45,006
You know what?

700
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:51,471
I received a letter,

701
00:58:53,765 --> 00:58:56,017
from my mother.

702
00:58:58,103 --> 00:59:02,274
She's asking for forgiveness
for what she has done to me.

703
00:59:04,851 --> 00:59:08,392
For abandoning me,

704
00:59:09,364 --> 00:59:11,445
for leaving me.

705
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:16,538
She said, it's all her fault,

706
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:20,625
why...

707
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:26,798
my life's full of misery.

708
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,150
But my mother's wrong,

709
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:41,133
it's not her fault,

710
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:46,070
whatever happened to my life,

711
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:55,214
and I don't blame anyone,

712
00:59:58,997 --> 01:00:00,006
because

713
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:04,582
this is my body.

714
01:00:11,843 --> 01:00:13,174
It's my decision

715
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:22,311
to do the things I've done with my body.

716
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:29,568
No, Andeng.

717
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,926
The world has been cruel to you,

718
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:43,474
A lot of guys took advantage

719
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:46,974
of your situation and weaknesses.

720
01:00:52,092 --> 01:00:54,177
I don't blame them,

721
01:00:56,179 --> 01:00:58,682
I don't blame anyone.

722
01:01:06,273 --> 01:01:08,980
At the twilight of my life,

723
01:01:12,578 --> 01:01:16,383
I've realized that they are part

724
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:23,331
of shaping the person
who I've become.

725
01:01:27,168 --> 01:01:29,004
All of them,

726
01:01:31,715 --> 01:01:33,174
Joel,

727
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:37,954
Andrew,

728
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:43,468
Sir Peter,

729
01:01:45,645 --> 01:01:47,074
even Carding,

730
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,504
all of them.

731
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,796
Why?

732
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,714
why those bad people,

733
01:02:08,293 --> 01:02:10,503
are the ones you want  to remember?

734
01:02:14,632 --> 01:02:16,426
Why do you remember them?

735
01:02:19,763 --> 01:02:21,503
How about those people

736
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:25,323
who truly cared for you?

737
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,429
Those people that even if it's painful

738
01:02:31,107 --> 01:02:33,081
and hard for them,

739
01:02:35,362 --> 01:02:37,738
they chose to stay, just for you.

740
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:45,256
How about me, Andeng Ligaya?

741
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:52,269
Can't you remember me?

742
01:03:11,564 --> 01:03:14,038
Even if you're not here,

743
01:03:24,244 --> 01:03:26,334
but you are always here,

744
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:28,455
in my heart,

745
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:32,045
Carlo.

746
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,576
Still, I will do everything
for you, Ligaya.

747
01:05:25,323 --> 01:05:29,661
I’d rather be the one to
burn in hell than you.

748
01:05:30,954 --> 01:05:33,581
If only to end your suffering, Ligaya.

749
01:05:34,624 --> 01:05:39,106
Just so you may take
your leave with dignity intact.

750
01:05:59,234 --> 01:06:02,775
Thank you, Carlo.

751
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:17,916
Thank you, Andeng Ligaya.

752
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:43,318
Goodbye, Ligaya.

753
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:45,987
Farewell,

754
01:06:46,696 --> 01:06:47,696
Ligaya.
