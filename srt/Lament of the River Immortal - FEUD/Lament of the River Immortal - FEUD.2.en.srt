[Prosperity]

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,509
Sect Leader,

5
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,870
although no outsiders were found

6
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,240
in Li Qingyue's room,

7
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,150
there were signs of someone else having stayed there.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,190
[Shangguan Riyue]

9
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,750
Aren't these clothes the best evidence?

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Earlier, when Li Qingyue was getting food,

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,710
I noticed something was amiss.

12
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,000
And then I saw with my own eyes

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,070
that there was a strange man in her room.

14
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,590
This person must be hiding somewhere in our sect.

15
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,280
With such sneaky behavior,

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,919
he surely isn't from any respectable sect.

17
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,480
Master.

18
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,240
I have worked with Li Qingyue for three years.

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,700
I know her character well.

20
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,110
There must be some misunderstanding here.

21
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,800
Shangguan,

22
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,970
that Li something-yue,

23
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,910
[Dan Yang]

24
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,120
whose disciple is she?

25
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,150
Li Qingyue is a disciple under Master Qing Yang.

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
She has been in our sect for 11 years.

27
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,520
Order the entire sect to be on high alert.

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,280
We must find the outsider.

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,300
I understand, Master.

30
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,680
Zhang Suan.

31
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,040
You've volunteered to guard the mountain gate for 3 years now.

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,480
It's time for you to come back, isn't it?

33
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:24,340
I previously damaged my foundation, and my qihai was completely destroyed.

34
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,570
Being able to guard the mountain gate is enough for me.

35
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,470
I dare not trouble you

36
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,020
any further, Master.

37
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,170
Look at him.

38
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
What a cruel joke fate has played.

39
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,260
Why are you here?

40
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,579
I am here to see you.

41
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,140
Where were you last night?

42
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,870
They didn't manage to find you?

43
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,910
You said it yourself.

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,210
I must not be seen by others.

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,610
Things have changed since.

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,760
Now, they are accusing me of hiding a demonic cultivator.

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,090
Help me clear this up by stepping forward.

48
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,050
I was the one who proposed to you.

49
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,780
They won't give you a hard time.

50
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,510
Even if they accuse me of caring only about love,

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,110
it's still much better than being accused of betraying the sect.

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,700
Have you ever thought

53
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,310
what if I am indeed a demonic cultivator?

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,650
What do you mean?

55
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,530
Before proposing to someone,

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,830
don't you think it's only right to ask

57
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,090
about their identity?

58
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,480
Are you also from the Yinlian Sect?

59
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,730
I'm sorry, I can't be responsible for you anymore.

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
Senior Meng is a cautionary tale for me.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,930
So I can't follow in his footsteps.

62
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,920
The betrothal gifts I gave you earlier,

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,520
consider them as my apology.

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
You should go.

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,020
Do you really want me to leave?

66
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,020
Those who walk different paths can't work together.

67
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,240
I acknowledge the debt I owe you for saving my life before.

68
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,270
Letting you go now makes us even.

69
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,950
Fine.

70
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,120
As you wish.

71
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,720
Now I'm done for.

72
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,660

[Prosperity]

74
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,230
Sect Leader, Li Qingyue is here.

75
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,120
Li Qingyue, who exactly was in your room?

76
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,159
What's their purpose of coming to Jingyun Sect?

77
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:43,880
[May your spirit shine across all realms]

78
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,480
I was previously saved by him.

79
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,280
Seeing he had nowhere to go, I felt sorry for him

80
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,880
and took him in for a few days.

81
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,600
He has now left the sect.

82
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,120
What is his name and which sect is he from?

83
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,080
Junior Li, if what you'd said is true,

84
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,960
then tell us that person's name.

85
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,080
It would help clear up any misunderstandings when we investigate later.

86
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,670
What's wrong?

87
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,180
Is he from a demonic sect?

88
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,430
Although he is from Yinlian Sect,

89
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,430
he saved my life.

90
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,510
I saw that he did no evil,

91
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,390
so I thought he might not be...

92
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,000
Absurd!

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,920
Since you knew he was from Yinlian Sect,

94
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,270
how dare you took him in?

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,720
I had only just realized his identity.

96
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,240
What?

97
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,190
Didn't you say he had already left the sect?

98
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,590
How is it that you've met?

99
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:34,950

Speak!

101
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,390
Who exactly is he?

102
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,270
I'm not sure either.

103
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,659
I only know his name is Bai Jiusi.

104
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,740
What... did you say his name was?

105
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,630
Bai Jiusi.

106
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,780
Nonsense! Utter nonsense!

107
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,520
How did you come to know the sacred name of Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

108
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,160
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
Impossible. He said he was...

110
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,190
Enough!

111
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,840
Meng Chu may have gone astray, but at least he owns up to what he’s done.

112
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,360
And instead, you are keeping up with your lies.

113
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,330
The sect taught you to speak and act with dignity and virtue.

114
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,190
Yet, you haven't learned a thing.

115
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,950
I'm telling the truth, Master.

116
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,750
Take her away.

117
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,430
Continue searching for the demonic cultivator within the sect.

118
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,130
We must find him at all costs.

119
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,049
Yes, Master.

120
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,380
Sect Leader, everything I said is true.

[May your spirit shine across all realms]

122
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,600
I did not lie!

123
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,059
Sect Leader, I'm telling the truth!

124
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,310
Sect Leader!

125
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,320
Sect Leader!

126
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,550
The sect's conduct has become more improper in recent times.

127
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,230
To think we now have deceitful individuals among us.

128
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,140
Looks like it’s time for me to restore order to the sect.

129
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,600
Yes, Sect Leader.

130
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,790
Do you know what Li Qingyue said?

131
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,270
-What did she say?
-What did she say?

132
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,410
She said the person she hid is called Bai Jiusi.

133
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,480
Bai Jiusi.

134
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,740
I've asked around.

135
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,270
That's the sacred name of Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

136
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,450
Do you know who Heavenly Lord Dacheng is?

137
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,960
He's one of the divine beings from Nine Heavens.

138
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,550
A divine being?

139
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,600
How could low-ranking disciples like us

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,190
ever hope to see someone like that?

141
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,090
In my opinion, even the Sect Leader

142
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,010
might not have seen his true face.

143
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,810
Li Qingyue is just a mere gatekeeper,

144
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,350
yet she has the nerve to lie so outrageously.

145
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,370
She should take a look at her own pitiful state.

146
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,460
I won't even dare to dream of doing that.

147
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,940
As disciples of Jingyun Sect,

148
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,980
we should repent if we make mistakes.

149
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,930
But if one's full of lies,

150
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,270
they should be expelled from the sect.

151
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,490
If you ask me,

152
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,720
this Li Qingyue must have fallen for

153
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,810
some low-class demonic cultivator.

154
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,630
But because it's too shameful to admit,

155
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,030
she's trying to throw mud

156
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,950
at Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

157
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,940
This way, there's no way Sect Leader can investigate.

158
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,960
-What's going on?
-What's wrong?

159
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,290
-Slowly.
-Take it easy.

160
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,870
Let's eat, let's eat.

161
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,490
Senior Zhang, where are you going?

162
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,670
Didn't Master ask all disciples

163
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,470
to gather at Ascension Terrace?

164
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,330
But I can't let you go.

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,250
What do you mean?

166
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,280
If I let you go today,

167
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,160
then the ones expelled from the sect...

168
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
will be more than just Junior Li.

169
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,740
You want to stop me?

170
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,950
Yes.

171
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,580
Then try me.

172
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,450
If this was three years ago, I certainly couldn't beat you.

173
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,180
But now, Senior Zhang, you should be aware that

174
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,620
you're no match for me.

175
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,810
Back then, you and I entered the sect together.

176
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm grateful for your care.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,410
So today, I cannot stand by and watch you make a mistake.

178
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,740
Li Qingyue, as a disciple of Jingyun Sect,

179
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,710
you should reject evil and uphold integrity.

180
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,460
If you're willing to reveal the real identity

181
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,030
of this demonic cultivator,

182
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,120
I will give you a chance

183
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,150
to repent and redeem yourself today.

184
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,780
Sect Leader, I've truly told you everything.

185
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,870
There's not a single lie in my words.

186
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,190
If that's the case,

187
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,880
then Jingyun Sect can no longer keep you.

188
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,520
All the Taoist knowledge you possess

189
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,380
was learned here at Jingyun Sect.

190
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,550
To prevent you from straying onto an evil path in the future,

191
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,670
I will strip you of your cultivation today

192
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,240
and expel you from the sect.

193
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,360
From now on, whether you live or die

194
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,180
has nothing to do with Jingyun Sect.

195
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,320
Is telling the truth also a mistake?

196
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
Senior Meng is still imprisoned,

197
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,450
so why should I be expelled?

198
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,150
One must be trustworthy in conduct and act with integrity.

199
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,010
You don't even understand these basic principles.

200
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,760
All disciples, heed my command.

201
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Let this be a warning for the future.

202
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,470
Didn't I tell you to leave?

203
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,300
Why did you come back?

204
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,850
So you're that demonic cultivator.

205
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,370
How dare you!

206
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,030
Yun!

207
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,660
Everyone, form the formation!

208
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,190
[Xuan Wei]

209
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,620
Master Xuan Wei, why have you come out of seclusion?

210
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,560
If I hadn't come out, you guys would've offended the divine race.

211
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
I, Xuan Wei from Jingyun Sect,

212
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,700
pay my respect to Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

213
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,770
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

214
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,490
Is he really Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

215
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,290
I came out of seclusion after sensing the Heavenly Lord's spiritual energy.

216
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,200
This is a sudden visit.

217
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,590
May I ask what brought you here, My Lord?

218
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,100
I've come to find

219
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,280
my spiritual partner.

220
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,240
She's awake, she's awake!

221
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,480
Hurry, hurry!

222
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,190
She's finally awake!

223
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,180
Look!

224
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,390
I've brought you some fruit.

225
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,910
Qingyue, are you feeling better?

226
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,840
I've brought you some tonics.

227
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,360
I brought them specially from my hometown.

228
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,340
Are you hungry? I brought you some delicious food.

229
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,470
If there's anything else you want, I'll go get it for you.

230
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,870
What's wrong with all of you?

231
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,150
Move aside, move aside, move aside!

232
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,670
Move aside, move aside, move aside!

233
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,080
All of you just know how to flatter the powerful and bully the weak.

234
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,150
Here, Junior Li.

235
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,270
You must be thirsty after sleeping for so long.

236
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,670
Try this tea I've specially brewed for you.

237
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
It's fragrant and aromatic.

238
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,720
Here.

239
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,230
Junior Li, you are the person who knows me best.

240
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,270
You should know that

241
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,120
I always focus on the issue, not the person.

242
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,790
If I've offended you in any way before,

243
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,070
it was definitely for the sake of the sect.

244
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,600
Junior Li, you are the kind to see the bigger picture.

245
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,250
You surely won't hold it against me, right?

246
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,270
Just think about it. When you were injured previously,

247
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,800
I even went to guard the mountain gate for you.

248
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,250
If I had known things would turn out this way,

249
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,110
I wouldn't have stopped you then.

250
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,090
I took that hit for nothing.

251
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,150
Come, come, let's tuck you in nicely.

252
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,550
Let's tuck you in nicely.

253
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,860
It's easiest to catch a cold at this time.

254
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,520
Here.

255
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,730
Qingyue needs to be resting up now.

256
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,990
Junior Li, the Sect Leader requests your presence.

257
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,670
-Yes.
-Yes.

258
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,770
Junior Li!

259
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,369
When you rise to wealth and power, don't forget about us.

260
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,579
How great.

261
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,680
Disciple Li Qingyue pays respects to the Sect Leader.

262
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,080
Greetings to all elders—

263
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,850
Why are you here?

264
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,230
Li Qingyue.

265
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,690
Don't be disrespectful in front of Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

266
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,180
H-H...

267
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,300
Are you really Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

268
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,830
My Lord, is it really her?

269
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,250
That's right.

270
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,460
My Lord, you really know how to pick the right people.

271
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,670
This child has been in our Jingyun Sect for over 10 years.

272
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,220
She's the most considerate and sensible.

273
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,270
She understands the bigger picture and is sensible.

274
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,430
She is also quick-witted, knowledgeable, and richly talented.

275
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,160
Her aptitude is also excellent.

276
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,090
Although her cultivation level isn't high, she has solid foundation.

277
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,350
Most precious of all,

278
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,020
she is loyal and has a heart of gratitude.

279
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,870
She speaks with care, acts with caution, and stays humble.

280
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,860
She's a role model for the 3000 disciples of our sect.

281
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,790
M-Me?

282
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,590
Look at that modesty.

283
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
This is just one of her many virtues.

284
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,790
I've been in seclusion for over 200 years.

285
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,390
To encounter such a joyous matter upon my exit

286
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,640
is also a blessing for our sect.

287
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,070
My Lord, may I ask if you have any orders regarding this marriage?

288
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,210
Marriage?

289
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,450
I have already accepted her betrothal gifts.

290
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,240
The rest is up to you.

291
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,160
My Lord, then when do you think would be

292
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,800
a good date for the wedding?

293
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,860
Like I said,

294
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,440
it's up to you.

295
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,360
Whose marriage are we talking about?

296
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,940
Who else in this hall could be getting married?

297
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,590
Many matters await me at Canglei Palace. I'll take my leave.

298
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,210
Wait!

299
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,740
I still have questions.

300
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,310
Li Qingyue, how many years have you been in our sect?

301
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,310
It's been 11 years.

302
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,220
Then before you joined the sect,

303
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,910
who were your parents and where did you live?

304
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,210
I have lived at the foot of Yufan Mountain since birth.

305
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,170
My father was a woodcutter.

306
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,350
My mother was an ordinary farm worker.

307
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,480
My master, Master Qing Yang, got drunk

308
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,270
and accidentally entered Miasma Forest.

309
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,930
It was my father who saved her.

310
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,260
To repay his kindness,

311
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,350
my Master took me in as her disciple.

312
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,010
Where are your parents now?

313
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
They have both passed away.

314
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,590
Are you sure your father

315
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,650
was just an ordinary woodcutter?

316
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,920
Perhaps

317
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,380
he was a powerful cultivator

318
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,540
and is currently living in seclusion in the mountains?

319
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,950
But he got into a fight with a villager

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,030
and died from a head injury.

321
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,280
Done with the questioning?

322
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,590
Senior Zhang, why are you here?

323
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,160
Master Dan Yang said

324
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,510
I must stay by your side at all times from now on

325
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,770
to ensure your safety.

326
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,200
There's no need.

327
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,110
What danger could there be within the sect?

328
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,640
How can it not be dangerous?

329
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,530
For all we know, someone could be secretly hiding an outsider.

330
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,830
Senior, I didn't mean to hide it from you.

331
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,070
-I couldn't find a chance to tell you...
-Qingyue.

332
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,230
So in the past few days...

333
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,760
you guys were living together?

334
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,240
That day when you asked me about the betrothal gifts,

335
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,560
it was for him, right?

336
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,470
Yes, it was.

337
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,470
Do you... really like him?

338
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,840
He's so handsome.

339
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,340
And he saved my life.

340
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,180
I have no reason not to like him.

341
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,770
Alright.

342
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,640
Zi Yang.

343
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm here.

344
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,030
Li Qingyue's parents passed away early.

345
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,640
Her only close relative left is her Master.

346
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,540
Qing Yang must be present on her wedding day.

347
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,840
Have you notified her?

348
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,070
I have already sent out an urgent order.

349
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Junior Qing Yang should have received the message and is on her way back.

350
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,990
Our Jingyun Sect has been established for 300 years.

351
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,830
When our sect's founder established the sect,

352
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,960
he passed down to his disciples a single word: courage.

353
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,500
True courage comes from inner strength.

354
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,780
He who faces death with no fear, pressing on with courage and bold resolve.

355
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,430
With benevolence in the heart, courage naturally follows.

356
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,240
Without righteousness, chaos will surely arise.

357
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,100
Unafraid, untroubled, unwavering.

358
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,730
Such is the spirit and honor of our Jingyun Sect.

359
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,160
Master, your words are absolutely right.

360
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,790
Although Heavenly Lord Dacheng's status is noble,

361
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,270
we must not lose our spirit.

362
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,310
On the wedding day, we must remember,

363
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,510
"Do not be greedy, do not flatter, do not pander."

364
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,400
Though the divine race is superior,

365
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,480
Jingyun Sect must not lose our honor.

366
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,550
We understand.

367
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,150
Good. Now let's discuss the wedding arrangements.

368
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,270
Senior,

369
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,400
what kind of bird is this exactly?

370
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,260
Why do we keep seeing it recently?

371
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,210
I don't know.

372
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,510
But it must be because Jingyun Sect has good feng shui,

373
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,440
attracting it to linger around our sect.

374
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,030
That makes sense. Our sect's feng shui is indeed excellent.

375
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,350
Isn't it?

376
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,510
Not to mention this white bird,

377
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,830
even Heavenly Lord Dacheng has been attracted here.

378
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,830
Lower your voice.

379
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,700
Arm length, 2 feet 1 inch.

380
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,940
Arm length, 2 feet 1 inch.

381
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,980
Junior Qingyue, let's measure your shoulders.

382
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,510
How did Heavenly Lord Dacheng...

383
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,180
come to fancy Li Qingyue?

384
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,270
This is even more surprising than red rain falling from the sky.

385
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,960
Exactly.

386
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,420
Do you all really think...

387
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,980
Qingyue.

388
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,460
-Junior Li, there's space here.
-Qingyue.

389
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,530
Come, sit here.

390
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,020
Shut your eyes, quiet your mind; hold steady, and focus your spirit.

391
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,450
Magnificent in presence, as if cradling Mount Kulun itself.

392
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,610
Concentrate!

393
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,370
This is Jade Spirit Spring.

394
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,190
Its water is sourced from the depths of Xiaoqiu Mountain.

395
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,510
It's rich with jade essence, making it especially nourishing.

396
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,650
From today on, come here everyday for a dip at this time.

397
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,930
It will be good for you.

398
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,350
These dishes

399
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,270
took a whole day to prepare.

400
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,310
So you must eat more later.

401
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,890
How could I eat so much?

402
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,910
Do you still think you're the same Junior Li as before?

403
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Then who am I?

404
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,200
You are Heavenly Lord Dacheng's spiritual partner.

405
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,640
They call this the 'Golden Turtle Descends to the Sea' Pill.

406
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,510
It's made from cinnabar and moonstone,

407
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,370
supplemented with the shell of a century-old Dongting black turtle.

408
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,030
Are all these for me?

409
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,260
These aren't for you.

410
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,530
But, all other pills in this pill room

411
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,770
are at your disposal.

412
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,730
[Qing Yang]

413
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,220
My good disciple!

414
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,320
Your Master has come to see you.

415
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,260
Did you miss me?

416
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,780
Come.

417
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,070
Take a sip.

418
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,000
Mingyue.

419
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,030
It's Qingyue.

420
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,320
How come this name is so similar to mine?

421
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,680
Master, you gave me this name.

422
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,070
You used to say that I had

423
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,960
a bit of your old flair when I was little.

424
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,490
So you bestowed upon me the character 'Qing'.

425
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,680
You're 19 years old this year, right?

426
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,030
Yes.

427
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,830
It's been a long time since we've seen each other.

428
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,680
Do you have any doubts about your cultivation?

429
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,160
Feel free to ask me anything.

430
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,640
When I was 9 years old,

431
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,370
Master said that as long as I mastered the basics,

432
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,800
you would teach me magic.

433
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,810
And then?

434
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,960
Then I never saw you again, Master.

435
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,040
None of that matters now.

436
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,440
As your Master, I'm here to ask you just one question.

437
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,350
Are you willing?

438
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,920
What?

439
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,920
Are you willing to marry Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

440
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,690
After all these days,

441
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,820
you're the only one who's asked me that, Master.

442
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,030
And... your answer is?

443
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,490
Sect Leader said Heavenly Lord Dacheng is a real god from the celestial realm.

444
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,470
As human cultivators,

445
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,300
we may cast aside material desires and sever worldly emotions,

446
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,900
diligently practice in these deep mountains,

447
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,960
all for the hope that one day we can ascend to the celestial realm,

448
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,760
become immortals and gods, and seek eternal life.

449
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,590
It's my great fortune to have caught the eye of the Heavenly Lord.

450
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,000
This kind of chance comes once in an eternity.

451
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,070
Let alone becoming the Heavenly Lord's spiritual partner,

452
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,590
even if I am simply tasked to be his gatekeeper,

453
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,920
it's still an extremely rare opportunity

454
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,350
that living beings across all realms,

455
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,000
heaven and earth, would die for.

456
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,590
That's one way to put it.

457
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,550
But getting married is quite different from being a gatekeeper, isn't it?

458
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,750
Even if you are a mortal,

459
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,950
there should be mutual consent, right?

460
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Moreover,

461
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,750
what exactly did Heavenly Lord Dacheng see in you?

462
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,310
I don't know.

463
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,920
Look, you are not naturally talented.

464
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,590
Even if you practice diligently,

465
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,470
I'm afraid there's not much to hope for in this lifetime.

466
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,880
Just like any mortal, you will live in mediocrity for a few decades,

467
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,810
only to wither away in the end and return to the cycle of reincarnation.

468
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,160
Now, a heavenly opportunity has bestowed you

469
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,800
with the great fortunate of ascending to heaven in a single step.

470
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,310
But this might not necessarily be a blessing.

471
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,370
You should think about it carefully.

472
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,720
Bai Jiusi.

473
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,880
Are you still here?

474
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,070
Heavenly Lord Dacheng!

475
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,070
Bai Jiusi!

476
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,220
What's up with him?

477
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,790
So much for getting married when he wouldn't even show up.

478
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,190
I still have lots of questions I want to ask.

479
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,760
What questions?

480
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,440
My Lord!

481
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,140
You're really still here.

482
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,270
Just passing by.

483
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,240
What a coincidence.

484
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,910
What questions did you want to ask just now?

485
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,290
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

486
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,550
I didn't know your identity before,

487
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,350
which led to my disrespectful behavior.

488
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,350
So... why did you choose me as your spiritual partner?

489
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,360
I thought you were aware.

490
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,680
So...

491
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,810
you like me too, right?

492
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,110
I like you too?

493
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,710
Yes, because I like you.

494
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,170
So you like me too.

495
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,960
I accepted your betrothal gift.

496
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,440
Naturally, I can't break the engagement.

497
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,080
Then why did you accept it?

498
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,200
You gave it to me.

499
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,900
So if we cut to the chase,

500
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,190
it means that you like me too, right?

501
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,670
You have too many questions.

502
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,860
What? I've just started asking.

503
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,270
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, I know you like me too!

504
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,010
I will be a good spiritual partner to you!

505
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,560
Qingyue.

506
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,680
Senior Lyu!

507
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,050
You've been released too?

508
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,780
My Master pleaded with the Sect Leader on my behalf.

509
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,270
Qingyue.

510
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,400
I...

511
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,400
What are you doing?

512
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,510
Senior Meng didn't commit any major mistake.

513
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,510
He's chivalrous and kind-hearted.

514
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,350
The Sect Leader has ordered him

515
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,590
to be imprisoned in the Hall of Penance to repent for life.

516
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,390
I hope you can save him, Qingyue.

517
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,740
Please get up first.

518
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,000
I've heard a lot of rumours

519
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,460
about Senior Lyu and Senior Meng.

520
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,640
They all say both of you are the most oustanding

521
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,370
disciples in our Jingyun Sect.

522
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,100
You roam the world, slaying demons and evil spirits,

523
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,200
and are known for your kindness.

524
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,200
But Senior,

525
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,920
why is it that

526
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,510
you guys are kind and helpful to

527
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,710
the reformed juniors of the Demon Sect,

528
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,750
but so cold and indifferent to your fellow disciples?

529
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,480
That day when I was injured and urgently needed medicine,

530
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,790
I came to you for help.

531
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,870
Do you remember, Senior Lyu?

532
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,790
Also,

533
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,360
that day when you fled with Senior Meng,

534
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,810
did you really think I could help you,

535
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,080
or did you just want me to help share the blame?

536
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,620
Qingyue, I was in a panic that day.

537
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,000
If you must hold a grudge, hold it against me.

538
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,330
Don't hold it against Senior Meng. He—

539
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,030
Senior.

540
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,449
I don't have a grudge against you.

541
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,420
I just want to tell you that

542
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,489
you may have your reasons,

543
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,210
but I also have my principles.

544
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,670
Whether it's cultivating immortality or practicing chivalry,

545
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,070
it's all about cultivating one's character, not creating legends.

546
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,590
What one truly cares about, one will never regret, even in death.

547
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,360
What one doesn't care about, it will never matter even in life or death.

548
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,920
Qingyue—

549
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,190
Senior, you are the personal disciple of Master Dan Yang.

550
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,790
Master Dan Yang has high expectations for you.

551
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,840
To cultivate immortality is to cultivate the Dao.

552
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,969
Senior Meng has his own path to the Dao.

553
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,550
Then Senior, what is your path to the Dao?

554
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
Stop looking.

555
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,000
Who in this world would dare steal someone from Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

556
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,320
Why are you following me?

557
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,960
Of course I'm afraid you might do something foolish.

558
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,350
These days,

559
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,140
there's more than enough chaos in Jingyun Sect.

560
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,580
Why are you so guarded against me?

561
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,790
You know it yourself.

562
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,770
Now, I can't even win the most ordinary disciple

563
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,810
of Jingyun Sect.

564
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,280
No matter what,

565
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,370
you've been my senior since I joined the sect.

566
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,150
So you'll always be my senior.

567
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,760
Junior Li?

568
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,140
Why deceive me?

569
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,200
Senior Zhang?

570
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,070
Senior, I have something to tell you.

571
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,560
Have a good chat.

572
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,110
Senior, you were exceptionally talented in both techniques and spells.

573
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,770
You were a man of great talent.

574
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,670
But due to an accident, you got injured and damaged your foundation.

575
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,190
Since then, you've been unable to recover.

576
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,440
Guarding the gate with someone like me for 3 years,

577
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,800
you must have felt frustrated, right?

578
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,230
No.

579
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,360
Every day I spent guarding the gate with you

580
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,280
was, for me,

581
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,230
a great joy.

582
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,570
That's good.

583
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,800
I've been worried that

584
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
I might have caused you trouble in the past.

585
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,440
These are all medicine that I had

586
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,030
specially picked out from the pill room.

587
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,360
Although it might not be able to

588
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,070
fully heal your damaged foundation,

589
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,190
they can still enhance your magical powers.

590
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,320
Thank you for taking care of me all these years, Senior Meng.

591
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
Now that I'm leaving,

592
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,110
please accept these as a token of my gratitude.

593
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,310
No need for all these.

594
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,480
All these years, your presence in Jingyun Sect

595
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,540
has been rather...

596
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,600
insignificant.

597
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,540
Though you're now going to Nine Heavens,

598
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,120
I can't tell if this is for the better or worse.

599
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,980
Please take care of yourself.

600
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,570
Don't worry, Senior.

601
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,360
I might be overlooked here,

602
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,880
but when I am in heaven, I am sure I wouldn't be.

603
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,800
Here, take it. Take it.

604
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,150
The path of immortality is vast, and the journey of life is long.

605
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,110
Senior, till we meet again.

606
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,090
Are you really not afraid?

607
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,300
Regardless for better or for worst, I am not afraid.

608
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,850
Not bad at all.

609
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,330
As expected of my disciple.

610
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,110
The time has come.

611
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,320
Qingyue.

612
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,400
This sword was bestowed upon me by my Master years ago.

613
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,490
It has been safeguarded by the previous Sect Leaders of Jingyun Sect.

614
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,800
Today, I bestow it upon you.

615
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,280
You are the first person from our 12 provinces

616
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,280
to ascend to the Nine Heavens as a mortal.

617
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,970
You must remember, the Dao is the origin of all change.

618
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,670
The Dao moves in harmony with nature. To do nothing is to do something.

619
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,370
As cultivators,

620
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,760
we seek to understand the universe and search for the laws of fate.

621
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,290
The path to pursue is none other than your own.

622
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,110
Gods have their way, humans have theirs.

623
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,670
A righteous heart will lead you onto a righteous path.

624
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,960
Even if heaven and earth collapse, evil cannot overcome righteousness.

625
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,280
Believe in yourself, and you will succeed.

626
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,470
I will remember, Master.

627
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,320
