Bai Jiusi, this is what you wanted to see.

It's not over yet.

Villagers!
This woman is a sorceress of dark arts.

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,910
She caused

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,160
all our suffering!

8
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,950
Rid us of her,

Don't worry. It's secure.

31

She really is a demoness.

[Resurrection Formation]

Everything in this world
follows the laws of nature.

40
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,560
Can't believe there's such
a heaven-defying formation.

41
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,510
That wandering immortal said

42
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,430
he stumbled upon the book.

43
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,290
The book records various divine artifacts.

44
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,450
After witnessing
the Hanlin Dagger's power,

45
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,120
I pinned all my hopes on this formation.

46
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,630
Does the Heavenly Lord Dacheng
know about this?

47
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,950
He only cares about the way of heaven.

48
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,080
What I'm doing defies that very order.

49
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,840
If he knew,
he'd definitely try to stop me.

50
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,070
So once I regained my spiritual energy,

51
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,930
I pretended to make peace with him

52
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,560
and used the Heaven-Turning Seal
to trap him,

53
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,160
ensuring he wouldn't interfere
with my plans.

54
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,320
That's his child too.

55
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,630
If he knew, he might even help you.

56
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,030
He wouldn't.

yet he left me behind and returned to
the Nine Heavens without a second thought.

Let alone the fact
that he's never even seen Shi'an.

why she wants you dead?

There's no such thing
as love without reason,

Now, it's time for you
to face your own karma.

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,790
Divine Lord Siling sure is lucky.

100
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,360
Three hundred years ago,

101
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,390
she turned the Nine Heavens upside down,

102
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,160
causing chaos everywhere.

103
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,960
Back then, I was immersed in cultivation,

104
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,670
wandering across the lands,

105
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,130
far from the Nine Heavens.

106
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,130
Otherwise, how could I have possibly
let her run wild like that?

107
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,630
At that time, I was painting
The Twin Realms of Mountains and Rivers.

108
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,440
That painting captured all of nature
and the world's spiritual energy in one.

109
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,580
It was incredibly taxing.

110
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,760
It took me over a decade
to complete that painting.

111
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
By the time I came out of seclusion,

112
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,850
Siling had already been slain
by Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

113
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
and her primordial spirit had fled
to the mortal realm.

114
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,790
Had I been there,
I would've wiped her out completely.

115
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,790
Things would never have become
such a mess.

116
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,120
I was indeed in the Nine Heavens.

117
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,120
But Siling was
Heavenly Lord Dacheng's spiritual partner.

118
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,440
In the end, it was a matter
between the couple.

119
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,700
How could I interfere?

120
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,780
It seems that no matter
how powerful a god may be,

121
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,750
once they're entangled in love,
they lose all reason.

122
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
Lieyang, what were you doing back then?

123
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,510
It's a pity.

124
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,480
I was in seclusion at that time.

125
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,000
By the time I came out,

126
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
Heavenly Lord Dacheng had already

127
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,000
destroyed Siling's body.

128
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,400
I never got the chance to step in.

129
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,870
That incident is the reason

130
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,120
I haven't set foot in Canglei Palace
for the past 300 years.

131
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,600
After all, it was Bai Jiusi
who acted recklessly,

132
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,120
wasn't it?

133
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,670
How could he go ahead with
something that big without waiting for us?

134
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,870
He let that menace got away for nothing.

135
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,550
The Four Venerables are truly remarkable.

136
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,630
Not a single one showed up
when we needed them.

137
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,200
But now that Canglei Palace
has taken action,

138
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,240
suddenly they're all here.

139
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,900
As long as no one says it out loud,
we can still pretend to be allies.

140
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,510
Tomorrow, we'll descend
to the mortal realm to slay Siling.

141
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,910
I hope the Four Venerables
won't come up with another excuse.

142
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,360
Of course.

143
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,750
Of course.

144
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,360
Why are you staring at me?

145
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,080
Next, I need you
to keep an eye on Zhang Suan.

146
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,220
Are you going to look for
the Divine Lord again?

147
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,829
I told you,
she already has someone in her heart.

148
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,230
You don't stand a chance.

149
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,160
That's my business.

150
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,390
It has nothing to do with you.

151
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Of course it does.

152
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,859
Did you steal my jade pendant?

153
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,880
Have some manners.

154
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,849
Isn't your jade pendant
hanging right there on your waist?

155
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,310
Do you remember

156
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,040
when you got this jade pendant?

157
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
I don't remember.

158
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,310
It's always been on me
for as long as I can remember.

159
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,370
My family said it's my protective charm.

160
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
Then it must be you.

161
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,200
Me?

162
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,300
I once asked Lord Yu Ya
who oversees the Book of Fate.

163
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,710
She said the one who holds
the other half of my jade pendant

164
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,080
is my destined partner.

165
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,610
That guy can help me
survive my love tribulation.

166
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,920
Then go find someone else
to survive it with.

167
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,910
You're really just throwing away
something you've had since childhood?

168
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,830
Yes, I don't want it anymore.

169
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,330
What did you do to me?

170
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,230
This is my Thread of Destiny.

171
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,260
I just casted a spell
to make it visible to you.

172
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,310
Don't mess around with me.

173
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,510
Get rid of it quickly.

174
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,210
How can I possibly break it?

175
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,750
It's a union decreed by the heavens,

176
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,930
not something I can just undo on a whim.

177
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,160

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,260
I'm telling the truth.

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,410
The horse can't pull it out.

182
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,680
Then get more people to help pull.

183
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,210
Exactly.

184
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,000
Listen,

185
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,060
we must reach the Jingyun Sect today.

186
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
If we don't,
something terrible will happen.

187
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,400
Master,

188
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,880
it's pitch black out here
in the middle of nowhere.

189
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
Where am I supposed
to find anyone to help?

190
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,290
Aren't you a person?

191
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,960
Aren't you a person?

192
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,960
Stop standing there spouting sarcasm!

193
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,160
Hurry up and help him lift!

194
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,640
Go!

195
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,170
Bian is still at the Jingyun Sect.

196
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,010
He's just a child.

197
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,270
If anything happens to him,

198
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,640
I don't want to live anymore.

199
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,400
I shouldn't have sent him there
in the first place.

200
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,110
Master, the young master
is already 23 this year.

201
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,200
He's already come of age,

202
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
not a child anymore.

203
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,560
Why are you so talkative?

204
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,920
Put some effort into it!

205
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,590
Do you need any help?

206
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,940
Is it a person or a ghost?

207
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,080
I don't know.

208
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,790
Um, who was just speaking?

209
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,720
Me.

210
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,030
What did you say?

211
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,490
I asked if you needed help.

212
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,810
Of course we need help.

213
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,440
Do you live nearby?

214
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,970
Do you have any father
or brothers at home?

215
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,170
We don't live nearby.

216
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,440
And we don't have any father or brothers.

217
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,030
Well, then do you have...

218
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,000
any strong sisters?

219
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,680
Aunts or grandmas work too.

220
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,030
As long as someone can help me
pull the cart out,

221
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,240
I'll offer a generous reward—

222
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
candied haws.

223
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,030
No need to go to such trouble.

224
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,160
I can do it by myself.

225
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,030
By yourself?

226
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,310
Does your sister

227
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,640
brag like this at home too?

228
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,070
This isn't the time for jokes.

229
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,270
I'm really in a hurry.

230
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Watch me.

231
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,240
What a big hole!

232
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,270
I really didn't expect that.

233
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,780
Miss, you're so strong!

234
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,880
Thank you for your help.

235
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,140
No need to be so polite.

236
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,960
Are you also going to the Jingyun Sect?

237
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
That's great!
I'm also going to the Jingyun Sect.

238
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,880
Do you know the way there?

239
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,200
I want to go too!

240
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,010
-Let's go together—
-Master!

241
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,350
Master, the wheel is broken.

242
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,440
We can't move now.

243
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,240
We need to fix it before we can go.

244
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,350
What are you good for?

245
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,350
Hurry up and fix it!

246
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,880
Alright.

247
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,780
Gosh, everything's going wrong.

248
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,160
How about this, Miss?

249
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,000
After I fix the cart,

250
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,640
I'll take you both to the Jingyun Sect.

251
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,350
How's that?

252
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,720
That's too much trouble.

253
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,400
How about this? I'll fly you there.

254
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
Just point me in the right direction.

255
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,070
Fly?

256
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
Master, are we still fixing the cart?

257
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,830
Magic is banned here.

258
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,140
We can't fly anymore.

259
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Let's walk there.

260
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,550
Glad to hear that.

261
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,210
Is there still no way
to wake up the Heavenly Lord?

262
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,900
His primordial spirit hasn't returned.

263
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,970
Naturally, he can't be awakened.

264
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Dawn is breaking.

265
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,110
If the Heavenly Lord doesn't wake up soon,

266
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,960
no one will be able to stop

267
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,590
Long Yuan from descending
and going on a killing spree.

268
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,000
Master's primordial spirit
doesn't seem to have been taken,

269
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,640
it feels more like...

270
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,290
he doesn't want to wake up.

271
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,270
My Lord,

272
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,400
please wake up.

273
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,240
If you don't wake up,

274
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,440
Lady Qingyue will be in trouble.

275
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,400
Greetings, Grandmaster.

276
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,170
Where are the Four Venerables?

277
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,310
We've sent people
to invite them several times.

278
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,770
They keep saying
they're coming right away.

279
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,450
We won't wait for them anymore.

280
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,720
Let's descend and face the battle.

281
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,110
Master.

282
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,880
Master.

283
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,670
Master, you're alright now.

284
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,360
Withdraw the troops.

285
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,920
Go back.

286
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,790
Master, Siling—

287
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,000
Listen up, all of you!

288
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
From this moment on,
if anyone from Canglei Palace

289
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,850
dares lay a hand on
a member of the Jingyun Sect again,

290
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,270
their immortal bones will be stripped,

291
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,920
and they'll be expelled
from Canglei Palace.

292
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,650
Understood.

293
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,350
Are we still fighting or not?

294
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,920
Yeah, why's it gone all quiet now?

295
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,240
Master, it seems something's happened
at Canglei Palace.

296
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,610
-My Lady!
-Li Qingyue!

297
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,920
My Lady.

298
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,030
I've finally found you, My Lady.

299
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,920
Li Qingyue!

300
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,480
Father?

301
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,590
Bian.

302
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,790
Father!

303
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,880
Bian.

304
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,720
Father!

305
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,440
My Lady!

306
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,240
I've finally found you.

307
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,960
Li Qingyue!

308
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,550
My Lady!

309
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,350
My Lady.

310
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,030
My Lady.

311
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,070
Li Qingyue, I'm so hungry.

312
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,240
Make me some food quickly.

313
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,170
Don't you dare touch Her Ladyship.

314
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,840
It seems the battle won't happen today.

315
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,960
Everyone, go back to your cultivation.

316
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,420
Don't let your guard down.

317
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,270
Yes, Grandmaster.

318
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Bai Jiusi's primordial spirit
has left his body again?

319
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,160
Yes.

320
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,740
I knew it wasn't your doing.

321
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,550
But that Immortal Lord Long Yuan

322
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,930
insisted it was.

323
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,270
Not only did he mobilize
the forces of Danxia Land,

324
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,770
but he also summoned the Four Venerables.

325
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,370
[Prosperity]

326
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,440
Moreover, he used the Skyshade Mirror
to issue a challenge,

327
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,310
openly defying the Heavenly Lord's command

328
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,330
not to harm you.

329
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,490
He really gave such a command?

330
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,710
When did that happen?

331
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,160
Right after he woke from his last coma.

332
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,370
My Lady, the Heavenly Lord
surely holds you in his heart.

333
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,480
So even if you meant to kill him,

334
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,790
he still couldn't bring himself
to hurt you.

335
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,160
It's all because
Immortal Lord Long Yuan

336
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
acted on his own.

337
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,520
We all laugh at him behind his back,

338
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,310
saying if someone didn't know better,

339
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,910
they'd think he was the one
who'd been wronged.

340
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
My Lady, I'm not saying
you wronged the Heavenly Lord.

341
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
But with Long Yuan
going after the Divine Lord like that,

342
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,450
how did you manage
to escape from Canglei Palace?

343
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,380
I almost forgot
if you hadn't mentioned it.

344
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,000
On the day Immortal Lord Long Yuan issued
the challenge with the Skyshade Mirror,

345
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,400
I secretly slipped away.

346
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,680
Fortunately, I received help
from Immortal Lord Fan on the way.

347
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,510
That's how I was able to
successfully reach the mortal realm.

348
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,040
He entrusted me with a task.

349
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,550
It's to give you this box.

350
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,680
He also said
that although you're on different sides,

351
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
this is the last thing he can do for you

352
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,640
as your father.

353
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,640
What is this?

354
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,410
I don't know.
You'll have to see for yourself.

355
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,840
I don't want anything from him.

356
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,350
I'm just the deliveryman.

357
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,750
If you don't want it,
you tell him yourself.

358
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,950
You're from Canglei Palace.

359
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,790
Not only did you descend
to the mortal realm to find me,

360
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,390
but you also told me all this.

361
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,040
Aren't you afraid
Long Yuan will come after you?

362
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,000
I was just afraid you might
misunderstand the Heavenly Lord.

363
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,310
That's why I snuck out.

364
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,720
It's all my fault for not knowing the way.

365
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
I wasted quite a few days.

366
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,310
Fortunately,
you haven't started fighting yet.

367
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,510
I think the Heavenly Lord
must have woken up today

368
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,570
and stopped Immortal Lord Long Yuan.

369
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,470
Bai Jiusi actually
doesn't want to kill me?

370
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,390
Of course!
The Heavenly Lord loves you so much.

371
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,570
How could he ever think of killing you?

372
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,030
Now that you've come to Jingyun Sect,

373
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,880
I'm afraid you can't return
to Canglei Palace anymore.

374
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,810
That's not true.

375
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,020
When you make peace
with the Heavenly Lord,

376
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,280
I'll be able to return to Canglei Palace.

377
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,790
That's not possible.

378
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,710
[Prosperity]

379
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,460
Heavenly Lord, where are you going now?

380
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,910
There's something I need to look into.

381
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,240
But if you leave now,

382
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,510
I'm afraid Immortal Lord Long Yuan might—

383
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,200
This time,

384
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,070
he won't dare.

385
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,940
Lingshu is back?

386
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,270
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

387
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,970
Lord Yu Ya,

388
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,560
help me check the Book of Fate
for two people.

389
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,790
What are their names?

390
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,630
I don't know.

391
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,510
If you don't know anything,

392
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
how do you expect me to check for you?

393
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Can you check now?

394
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,240
Yes, I can.

395
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,140
Yes, I can.

396
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,590
[Temple of the Primordial God]

397
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Take all of these.

398
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,590
Take this too.

399
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,960
Bring it back for a drink later.

400
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,750
We can't stay at

401
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,750
Jingyun Sect any longer.

402
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,790
Let's head back.

403
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,110
Bian, are you leaving?

404
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,750
Who said I'm leaving?
I'm not going anywhere.

405
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
Watch your words.

406
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,510
How could Bian be the kind of person

407
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,310
who fears death
and abandons his fellow disciples?

408
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,910
Exactly.

409
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,310
You're right.

410
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,680
Canglei Palace

411
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,240
now fears the unity of the Jingyun Sect.

412
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,590
Even their prior challenge
has been withdrawn.

413
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,680
I refuse to believe

414
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,590
Bian would choose to walk away now.

415
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,160
Exactly.
How could I possibly leave Jingyun Sect?

416
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,790
No.

417
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,480
No.

418
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,070
Wait, Bian.

419
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,030
Didn't you write to me
asking me to take you back?

420
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,350
Father, I know.

421
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,000
You must have missed me so much

422
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,880
that you made up a lie just to see me.

423
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,750
I didn't make it up.

424
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,350
Once I'm a disciple of Jingyun Sect,

425
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,830
I'll always be one.

426
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,110
There's no way I'm leaving.

427
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,510
Father, please stop trying to persuade me.

428
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,110
Listen—

429
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,550
You must be thirsty.
Have some water, Father.

430
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,640
You must be thirsty.

431
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,830
It's been a long journey.

432
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,830
Drink more water.

433
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,350
Drink more.

434
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,270
You guys go practice martial arts first.

435
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,530
I'll be there shortly.

436
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,500
-Let's go.
-Okay. We'll wait for you.

437
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,830
Wait, you need to supervise his training.

438
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,750
Father.

439
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,750
Stop talking.

440
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,350
You really don't want to leave, do you?

441
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:12,880
Father.

442
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,310
Now, Canglei Palace

443
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,030
doesn't even dare to attack Jingyun Sect.

444
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,480
Jingyun Sect is safe now.

445
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,550
I didn't leave when things were worse.

446
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,750
Why would I leave now?

447
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,270
If I stay

448
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,270
and weather the hardships
ith Jingyun Sect,

449
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,640
the rewards will come in time.

450
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,510
But, Bian,

451
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,970
people should know their own limitations.

452
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,980
Honestly,

453
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't think you should keep going.

454
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,480
Father,

455
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
are you looking down on your own son?

456
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,640
Trust me.

457
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,920
One day,

458
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,550
I'll become

459
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,610
a leading figure of Jingyun Sect too.

460
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,070
Who is it?

461
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,220
Bian, is that you?

462
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,510
The last thing you can do for me?

463
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,420
I'd like to see what you've done.

464
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,630
You...

465
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,940
I... I told you to find someone else.

466
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,000
Don't come to me.

467
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,400
Divine Lord...

468
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,389
Find the Divine Lord.

469
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,150
Her last words were to tell me
to find you.

470
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,550
She didn't say what happened to her.

471
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,830
My Lady, were you looking for me?

472
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,070
You're a wood-element tree spirit.

473
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,070
Can you check what's wrong with her?

474
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,960
She's asleep.

475
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,390
What's wrong?

476
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,970
Isn't this what you brought for Ling'er?

477
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,300
I'm a tree spirit, so I'll be fine.

478
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
But My Lady, please stay back.
Don't let the scent reach you.

479
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
There's a scent of Nightmare Flower
in here.

480
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,380
Nightmare Flower?

481
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,440
The Nightmare Flower
is native to the Hell Ruins.

482
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,670
It grows from
the remains of demonic beasts,

483
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,550
needing tens of thousands

484
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,590
of corpses to bloom.

485
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,900
It's rare to see even one in 100 years.

486
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,190
Its scent causes both gods and mortals

487
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,520
to lose consciousness.

488
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,940
After seven days,
they will die in their dreams.

489
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,330
Only Immortal Lord Fan holds the cure.

490
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,780
A flower from the Hell Ruins?

491
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,290
It's strange. Immortal Lord Fan

492
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,930
asked me to give it to his daughter.

493
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,460
How could there
be a Nightmare Flower inside?

494
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,150
Could it be someone trying to use him

495
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,280
to kill Fan Ling'er?

496
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,230
No.

497
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,590
Fan Jiaojiao is forcing us

498
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,050
to hand over his daughter.

499
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,070
Otherwise, he'd rather let her die.

500
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,640
How is that even possible?

501
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,190
What kind of father
could do something so cruel

502
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,320
to his own daughter?

503
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,550
Do you know how to counter
the effects of this flower?

504
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,480
It takes great effort
for this flower to bloom.

505
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,230
I've only seen it once before

506
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,670
from afar in the Hell Ruins.

507
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,330
I don't know how to counter it.

508
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,560
If we were to return Fan Ling'er,

509
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,280
should we have her father
come to pick her up

510
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,610
or should we find someone
to send her back to Canglei Palace?

511
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,480
We still don't know

512
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,190
if this is a trap to lure you in.

513
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,610
So whatever happens,
you must not show yourself.

514
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,800
There's no one in Canglei Palace
who can defeat me.

515
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,030
One may be no match for you,

516
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,030
but what if ten come at you?
Or hundreds? Or thousands?

517
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,920
Moreover, we still don't know

518
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,550
what's happening with Bai Jiusi.

519
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,030
The Heavenly Lord won't harm Her Ladyship.

520
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,690
But we can't just stand by
and watch Ling'er die.

521
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,490
Don't we still have seven days?

522
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,320
Let's investigate the situation
at Canglei Palace further.

523
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,580
It's not too late to make a decision then.

524
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,230
Let's count how many buns
are in the plate.

525
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,360
When I finish counting,

526
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
I will eat them all.

527
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,000
One,

528
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,920
two,

529
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,190
three,

530
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,510
four...

531
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,960
The little one can eat quite a lot.

532
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,800
Five,

533
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,880
six,

534
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,000
seven,

535
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,230
eight...

536
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,710
Come on, call me Brother,

537
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,670
and I'll buy you more buns.

538
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,550
Sounds good?

539
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,110
Eight,

540
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,670
nine,

541
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,360
ten.

542
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,360
What a big mouth you have!

543
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,800
What a big mouth you have!

544
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,190
Uncle, Senior.

545
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,280
Weren't you supposed to be practicing?

546
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,360
Why are you drinking again?

547
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,280
No, you're looking for my disciple...

548
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,590
Why do you need to see the Grandmaster?

549
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
That's none of your concern.

550
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,880
She's also an elder of our sect.

551
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,360
She has the right to be involved
in these matters.

552
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,420
Let's go together.

553
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:15,150
[Everlasting Grace and Legacy]

554
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,630
When we see the Grandmaster later,

555
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,360
don't drink and speak less.

556
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
And don't doze off.

557
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,140
[Temple of the Primordial God]

558
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,550
Since Miss Ling
is now under Master's care,

559
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,740
[Prosperity]

560
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,950
we can't just stand by and do nothing.

561
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,710
Master should stay
to guard the Jingyun Sect.

562
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,670
As for me,

563
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,880
I might pay a visit to Canglei Palace.

564
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,170
It's a good chance to find out
why the battle halted yesterday.

565
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,880
I think there's no need to rush.

566
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,110
We still have seven days after all.

567
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,360
Senior is right.

568
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,280
Grandmaster, I can go back
and check the ancient records

569
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,840
to see if there's a way
to cure the Nightmare Flower poison.

570
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,280
If there really is no cure,

571
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,810
it's not too late
to go to Canglei Palace then.

572
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,630
Wait.

573
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,190
Have you considered

574
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,000
that you've all attacked
the Nine Heavens before

575
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,130
and have a grudge with Canglei Palace?

576
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,320
If you go,

577
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,670
wouldn't it cause more conflict?

578
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,880
So why not let me go instead?

579
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,030
Nonsense! Your power isn't skilled enough.
How could you go?

580
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,960
Well, any one of you could use your power

581
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,760
to help me get there, right?

582
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,590
I've never fought
with Canglei Palace before.

583
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,880
When they see me,

584
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,000
they surely won't be as hostile.

585
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,580
Besides, in a war between two countries,

586
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,670
isn't it the rule not to kill envoys?

587
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,950
The immortals
should follow the same rule, right?

588
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,490
We'll discuss this matter later.

589
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,630
Let's first look for a way
to cure the Nightmare Flower poison.

590
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,190
Yes.

591
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,960
Yes.

592
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,500
[Cultivate the Mind]

593
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,480
Is there a master in this world
as pitiful as I am?

594
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,470
Having to sneak around
just to see my own disciple.

595
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,420
What are you doing here again?

596
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,630
To drink with you, of course.

597
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,480
Do you know why I volunteered

598
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,140
to go to Canglei Palace today?

599
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,880
Why?

600
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,420
For you.

601
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,670
Me?

602
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,030
Last time you told me

603
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,320
about the grudge
between you and Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

604
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
After hearing it,

605
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,030
I think there might be room
for reconciliation.

606
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,890
After all, I am your master.

607
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,070
I plan to be a mediator
between you and Bai Jiusi.

608
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,070
We don't need a mediator between us.

609
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,400
That may not be the case.

610
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,820
You're too close to the situation
to see it clearly.

611
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,370
As an outsider,
I can see things more clearly.

612
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,050
As you said,

613
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,550
Heavenly Lord Dacheng
is cold-hearted and born without emotions.

614
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,110
So when he found you back then,

615
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,710
he should've captured you on the spot

616
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,170
instead of marrying you
and taking you back to Canglei Palace.

617
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,190
He was just too arrogant.

618
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,800
You're really dense.

619
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,030
No wonder you haven't passed
your love tribulation all these years.

620
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,130
Everything you've said
is just your assumption.

621
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,360
You've never asked Heavenly Lord Dacheng
how he feels.

622
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,970
Given how you treated him,

623
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,630
the very fact
that Canglei Palace hasn't struck yet

624
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,280
proves he's not completely heartless.

625
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,250
I'm also confused about
why he hasn't made a move yet.

626
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Perhaps he's planning
an even bigger counterattack.

627
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,040
You're totally a lost cause.

628
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,630
Never mind.

629
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,320
I am your master after all.

630
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,840
I should teach you a thing or two.

631
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,440
Alright. Stop being so stiff.

632
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,340
You're like a wooden block.

633
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,150
Come on.

634
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Come here.

635
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,800
Sit down.

636
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,550
Here.

637
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,000
Tonight, let's have a good drink together.

638
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,880
Come on.

639
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,510
For centuries, you have schemed

640
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,760
for the sole purpose of killing him.

641
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,160
I understand all of that.

642
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,360
Everything you've suffered,
all the pain you've endured,

643
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,670
started with him.

644
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,280
Especially the agony
of losing your own child.

645
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,280
Intentional or not,

646
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,320
the harm is done,

647
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,760
and he's to blame.

648
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,170
But does that really make him
deserving of death?

649
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,550
I know you'll probably say

650
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,590
that I haven't been through what you have,

651
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,720
so who am I to speak a few words
and forgive on your behalf?

652
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,600
But my dear disciple,

653
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,510
every time you try to hurt him,

654
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,750
you're only hurting yourself
again and again.

655
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,380
Because deep down,
you still can't let it go.

656
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,680
You've hated him for hundreds of years,

657
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,680
and that only proves
you've loved him for just as long.

658
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,000
Without love,
where would the hatred come from?
