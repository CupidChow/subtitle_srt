[Episode 22]

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,770
What's going on?

4
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,759
It's only been one night;

5
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,460
how could Master's primordial spirit
leave his body again?

6
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,660
I'm not sure either.

7
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,760
But this time,
there's a golden body shield.

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,710
Master's primordial spirit should be safe.

9
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,400
Should be?

10
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,200
When it comes to Master's safety,

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,840
how can you speak with such uncertainty?

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,910
I'm a healer,

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,090
not a soul summoner.

14
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,400
It must be that witch Siling

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000
who used some trick

16
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,190
to steal Master's primordial spirit!

17
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,250
We shouldn't have let her stay alive.

18
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,490
It might not be her.

19
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,880
Then who else,

20
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,560
in all 12 provinces of Han,

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,300
would want to harm Master?

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,079
The Heavenly Lord's primordial spirit
has left his body once more.

23
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,750
Something's definitely happened.

24
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,030
Right now, the most urgent thing

25
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,890
is to find out
where his primordial spirit has gone.

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,820
I'm going to wipe out
Jingyun Sect right now.

27
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,120
Let's see if Siling still dares
to lay a hand on Master!

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,520
The Heavenly Lord said
we must not harm her.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,610
That's only because
Master's been bewitched by her.

30
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,470
Protecting Master

31
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,280
is our duty as disciples.

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,000
It's my responsibility
to remove any threat to him.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,870
Let's not even say for sure
whether it was Divine Lord Siling's doing.

34
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,470
With your cultivation level,
how could you possibly defeat her?

35
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,360
You're right. I can't beat her.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,240
But who said I'm going alone this time?

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Come back—

38
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,520
Take good care of the Heavenly Lord.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,579
I'll go check on him
before he stirs up any more trouble.

40
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,710

00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,800
Even if you enter the formation
with your primordial spirit,

00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
time cannot be reversed.

84
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,750
Who are you?

85
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,000
I am Xi E, the Goddess of Time.

86
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,440
You hold no divine rank
in the Nine Heavens.

87
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,680
That's a long story,

88
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,920
and I doubt you wish to hear it now.

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,750
So you're here to stop me.

90
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,610
It was your spell that alerted me.

91
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Manipulating time is a perilous act.

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,770
Even the Primordial God
would not try it lightly.

93
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,750
You are a remnant of his vital energy.

94
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,630
So I advise you to value your life more

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,430
and not act on impulse.

96
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,780
There is something

97
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
that matters more than life itself.

98
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,990
Like what?

99
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,480
The truth.

100
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
What's that mouth of yours for, huh?

101
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,830
If you want to know something, just ask.

102
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,390
The truth I seek,
whether it's true or false,

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,270
is like a sword without a hilt.

104
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,290
It hurts others as well as myself.

105
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,320
That's why I must see it with my own eyes.

106
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,270
I see.

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,870
You're afraid the truth you believe
might turn out to be real,

108
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,789
but you're just as scared
that what you uncover might be a lie.

109
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,750
You can't bear to make the person
who knows the truth

110
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,810
reopen old wounds,

111
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,200
so you'd rather turn back time
and dig into the past yourself.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,730
I don't have time to talk to you.

113
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,880
You'd better leave on your own.

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,700
Look at you,
turning hostile after just a few words.

115
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,630
Offering your primordial spirit
to the formation is too steep a price.

116
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,560
I told you, I'm the Goddess of Time.

117
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,360
I can show you the past you want to know.

118
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,600
But the truth isn't always kind.

119
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
It might delight you

120
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,170
or cause you unbearable pain.

121
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Bai Jiusi, to see or not to see,

122
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,150
you need to think it through.

123
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,460
I want to see it.

124
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,520
Then don't regret it.

125
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,870
Let's go.

126
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,870
Master was harmed
by villains and remains unconscious.

127
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,250
From this day on,

128
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,610
all within Canglei Palace
shall follow my command.

129
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,510
Yes.

130
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,670
Puyuan, Yongshou,

131
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,750
go to Danxia Land now
and set up a barrier.

132
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,110
No one shall come or go
without authorization.

133
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,440
Meanwhile, rally all our forces
outside Canglei Palace.

134
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,510
Be on high alert

135
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,430
and ready to descend
to the mortal realm at a moment's notice.

136
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,670
Yes.

137
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,270
Fan Jiaojiao,
go inform the Four Venerables:

138
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
Canglei Palace is preparing to send troops

139
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
against Divine Lord Siling.

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,680
Siling once stole
their celestial artifacts.

141
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,610
See if they're willing
to join forces with Canglei Palace now.

142
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,440
Yes.

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
At the battle of Tianmu Peak,

144
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,380
Siling conspired with the Jingyun Sect,

145
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,150
wounding my Master's immortal body

146
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,050
and disgracing
the divine prestige of our kind.

147
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,630
With wicked intent, Siling schemes,

148
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,960
and the Jingyun Sect enables her tyranny.

149
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,180
It is only right
that we seek justice for our Master—

150
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,320
lay waste to the Jingyun Sect,
slay Siling,

151
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,550
and reclaim
Master's lost primordial spirit.

152
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,010
Long Yuan, the situation
hasn't been fully investigated yet.

153
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,550
Are you planning to go against
the Heavenly Lord's previous command?

154
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,270
Everything I do is for Master's safety.

155
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,510
If blame must be assigned,
I'll bear it all.

156
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,240
You...

157
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,900
We're willing to share the responsibility
with Senior Long Yuan.

158
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:52,520
[Prosperity]

159
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,380
It's been two days since we returned.

160
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,820
How are things at Canglei Palace?

161
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,170
Any unusual movements?

162
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
Grandmaster,

163
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,720
Canglei Palace has set up a barrier
over the past few days,

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,120
sealing off Danxia Land.

165
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,960
But our scouts saw

166
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,510
four messengers depart from Danxia Land,

167
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,670
heading in all four directions—

168
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,870
east, south, west, and north.

169
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
Messengers?

170
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,810
Are they turning to the Four Venerables
for help?

171
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,460
This doesn't sound like Bai Jiusi at all.

172
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,150
Has a life of ease

173
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,120
dulled his courage?

174
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,910
Master, Canglei Palace
is calling for reinforcements.

175
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,030
Should we make some preparations?

176
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,080
No need.

177
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,870
We only have to wait;
he'll come to us himself.

178
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,030
Yes.

179
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,100
What did the Four Venerables say?

180
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,440
They've all given their replies.

181
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,170
Each one has agreed
to stand with Canglei Palace.

182
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,910
Once we give the command,
the might of all five lands

183
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,730
will unite to strike the Jingyun Sect.

184
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,000
Before the battle begins,
we should send them a fair warning.

185
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,800
Let them witness
the divine power of Canglei Palace.

186
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,790
Skyshade Mirror, go.

187
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,870
Why don't we go take a look?

188
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,960
If what Bian wrote in his letter is true,

189
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,870
then Jingyun Sect is no longer
a place to stay.

190
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,840
We can't do that.

191
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,980
Do you even know what he wrote?

192
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,640
The gatekeeping junior
became the Grandmaster,

193
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,870
an elder soared up to the Nine Heavens,

194
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,270
and now
there's talk of fights and killing.

195
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,750
How could he make up such ridiculous lies?

196
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,150
It's absolutely absurd.

197
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,630
I think he either
got himself into trouble,

198
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,480
or just doesn't want to cultivate anymore,

199
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,640
so he's making up excuses
to run home and live in comfort.

200
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
Ever since he was little,

201
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,960
he's never given us a moment's peace—

202
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,910
always shirking his studies,

203
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,320
but never missing a chance to slack off.

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,640
-I'm so angry!
-Dear.

205
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,550
Don't let it affect your health.

206
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,390
And you!

207
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,080
Overindulgence breeds incompetence.

208
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,940
You're to blame for coddling him.

209
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,270
Once we visit him,
he'll have someone to lean on.

210
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,720
That'll only make him even less willing
to focus on his cultivation.

211
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,630
Listen,

212
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,150
the Jingyun Sect
is a renowned immortal sect.

213
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,510
Their affairs have always been handled
with order and discipline.

214
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,390
The rules are strict and clear.

215
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,960
What could possibly go wrong?

216
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,910
But what if something does go wrong?

217
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,140
There you go again. Unless the sky falls,
there's nothing to worry about.

218
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,600
Master! Madam! Come out quickly!

219
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
The sky's about to collapse!

220
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,960
You and that jinxed mouth of yours!

221
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,020
What did I just say?

222
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,510
Everything was fine just a moment ago.

223
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,600
Why did the sky suddenly turn dark?

224
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,640
What's going on?

225
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,120
Yes, it was fine just a moment ago.

226
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,240
What's going on?

227
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,270
Dear, what on earth is happening?

228
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,730
-What happened?
-This...

229
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,870
Why did it suddenly go dark?

230
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,120
Could it be a solar eclipse?

231
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,720
Nonsense!

232
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,510
Have you ever seen a solar eclipse
cover the whole sky like this?

233
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,100
This...

234
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
You're right, dear.

235
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,440
Something serious must have happened.

236
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,230
[Jingyun Sect]

237
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,430
[Everlasting Grace and Legacy]

238
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
Before the dawn of time,
the world was shrouded in chaos.

239
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,270
The Primordial God forged the world

240
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,730
and with his divine form,
bestowed blessings upon countless beings.

241
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,160
He scattered his own flesh and blood
across the realms,

242
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,560
and only then did the human race
gain a world to call their own.

243
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,440
Humans were once as lowly as insects,

244
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,890
yet by a twist of fate,
they rose to become people.

245
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,390
The divine race guards
the Three Realms, Six Paths,

246
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,319
Four Seas, and Eight Desolations.

247
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,940
Only by their grace
do you continue to exist.

248
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,910
You ought to bear gratitude
in your hearts,

249
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,550
stand humbly upon the earth,
and offer reverence to the heavens above.

250
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,210
To be content with one's lot
is the way of heaven.

251
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,880
To revere the gods and honor the immortals
is a moral duty.

252
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,430
But now,
the Jingyun Sect of Yufan Mountain

253
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,880
has shown disrespect to the divine race
and blasphemed divine grace.

254
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,550
If such defiance goes unpunished,

255
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,960
chaos will descend upon the Three Realms,
and disorder will plague the Six Paths,

256
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,680
bringing calamity to all living beings.

257
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,740
In light of the innocents among them,

258
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,110
those who leave Jingyun Sect
within five days

259
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,550
shall not be held accountable
for past transgressions.

260
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,680
But after five days,
we will wipe out the sect.

261
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,410
Let this serve as a warning
to all in the mortal realm:

262
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,440
Those who defy shall meet the same end.

263
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,750
Long Yuan.

264
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,440
What are you doing?

265
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,270
As an immortal lord,
how can you abuse your powers

266
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,310
to interfere in the mortal realm?

267
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,840
Even the lowly Jingyun Sect

268
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,700
dared to trespass upon the Nine Heavens.

269
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
If left unchecked,

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,060
the world will truly fall into chaos.

271
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,070
As a deity,

272
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,130
it is my duty to sound the warning.

273
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,550
And I've already shown mercy.

274
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,960
I gave those in the Jingyun Sect

275
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,440
a chance to turn back.

276
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,930
In five days, war shall begin.

277
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,790
Yes!

Long Yuan.

279
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,750
Is your crusade against Jingyun Sect

280
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,810
for the greater good or for yourself?

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,160
For both.

282
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,290
Master's safety concerns the greater good.

283
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,350
My personal grievance stems from
the harm done to Master time and again.

284
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,790
Cang Tu,

285
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,550
I consider
that you serve by Master's side daily,

286
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,950
so I won't argue with you.

287
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,920
But if you continue to stand in my way,

288
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

295
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,960
the Emperor
has personally issued a decree,

296
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,270
asking about what has happened

297

[Temple of the Primordial God]

303
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,520
From the moment
the Primordial God forged the world,

304
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,000
I came into being,

305
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,830
dwelling between sky and soil,
as timeless as both.

306
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,640
Thousands of years ago,

307
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,850
I already knew
the Heavenly Lord Dacheng, Bai Jiusi.

308
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,110
There has long been a deep grudge
between us.

309
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,310
Back then, I used the Heaven-Turning Seal
to suppress his spiritual energy.

310
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,920
But he later broke free from the seal

311
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,750
and rallied many immortals
to attack Canglei Palace,

312
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,880
forcing me down into the mortal realm.

313
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,210
I kept a low profile for 300 years.

314
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,310
At first, I founded the Jingyun Sect

315
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,440
with the sole purpose of opposing him.

316
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,070
Some among you already knew of this

317
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,440
and once stood by my side
in the fight against him.

318
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,110
Some of you, however,
are still unaware of the truth.

319
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,310
By now, you've already done
more than enough for me.

320
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,880

321
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,340
weigh you down any longer.

If you decide to leave,
I won't stand in your way.

324
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,720
I'll give you three days.

325
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,590

I hope we'll share
wine and laughter again.

328
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,550
The Primordial God
poured all his spiritual energy

329

into shaping the mountains and rivers
and separating heaven from earth.

330
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,830
He sacrificed his own flesh and blood
to forge the sun, moon, and stars,

331

shedding light across all creation.
That is the greatest act of love.

I've lived as both deity and mortal.

333
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,910
Humanity is not insignificant,

334
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,560
nor do the divine beings
hold dominion over all under heaven.

335
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,240
For centuries, the Jingyun Sect
has stood firm in the mortal realm,

336
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,830
slaying demons and safeguarding life.

337
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,640
Our deeds withstand
judgment from the heavens,

338

remains clear before the people.

355
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,790
I have some important business
to take care of.

356
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,650
I don't have time to play with you.

357
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Let go.

358
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,030
Don't hold me. Let me go!

359
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,550
Go play by yourself.

360
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,750
Can't I just bring you some food
when I get back?

361
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,550
I don't want food.
I just want to find Li Qingyue.

362
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,480
Otherwise,
you're not going anywhere either.

363
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,110
I can still tell the difference

364
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,000
between a one-time treat
and an everyday meal.

365
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,250
Alright. I'll take you there.

366
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,070
But you must follow me closely.

367
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,870
And we can't let anyone else find out,
understand?

368
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,560
Let's go. Don't hold me back.

369
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,980
Let go of your hand!

370
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,280
What are you doing?
You bumped into me and it hurts!

371
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,960
You!

372
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,170
Are you planning
to descend to the mortal realm?

373
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
How could that be?

374
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm just bored and taking a stroll.

375
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,860
It seems I misunderstood.

376
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,070
I thought if you were going down,

377
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,260
I could escort you part of the way.

378
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,430
Wait, Immortal Lord Fan.

379
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,840
Do you really want to help me?

380
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,550
Long Yuan ordered his men

381
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,680
to set up a barrier around Danxia Land.

382
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,050
With your strength alone,

383
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,400
you won't be able to
break through the barrier and leave.

384
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,880
I'm with her.

385
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,000
Go away.

386
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,800
I can help you leave the Nine Heavens.

387
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,250
But you'll have to
do something for me in return.

388
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
What is it?

389
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,110
Jingyun Sect is currently
in a time of turmoil.

390
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,030
It's really not the right moment
to take outsiders in.

391
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,270
Besides, Qu Xingman
comes from the Yinlian Sect.

392
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,720
She even had clashes

393
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
with our disciples before.

394
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
It's hard to be sure

395
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,680
she doesn't have some hidden agenda now.

396
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,140
Xingman left the Yinlian Sect
because of me.

397
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,440
Obviously, she won't have any disloyalty.

398
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,900
That's just what she said.

399
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,110
Who knows
if she's in cahoots with her mother,

400
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,400
trying to exploit our crisis

401
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,460
for their own gain?

402
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,650
I know exactly what kind of person

403
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,030
Xingman is.

404
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,550
Senior, you've been bewitched
by that witch.

405
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,310
Junior, we've grown up side by side.

406
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,310
Our bond as fellow disciples
is unbreakable.

407
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,110
I've always seen you as a sister.

408
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,920
So please, don't set your heart

409
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,480
on me anymore.

410
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Xingman is the only one I care about.

411
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,510
It's always been that way
and always will be.

412
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,070
Senior.

413
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,550
Well said.

414
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,510
Stop putting on that righteous act

415
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,920
in front of Mr. Meng.

416
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Didn't you just use your fellow disciple

417
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,030
as a shield before?

418
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,360
Why are you suddenly so concerned about
Jingyun Sect now?

419
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,900
Fear of death is human nature.

420
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,650
I don't need to explain myself.

421
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,920
You're just an outsider causing trouble.

422
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,580
You have no right
to stand here and say anything.

423
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,030
Mr. Meng, am I really an outsider?

424
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,070
Junior, go find Master Dan Yang first.

425
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,360
Xingman doesn't know this place well;
I have to stay by her side.

426
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,410
Actually, what my junior said

427
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,990
isn't completely wrong.

428
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,730
The Jingyun Sect
is now in a time of crisis.

429
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,980
Aren't you afraid?

430
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,830
I am.

431
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,790
But more than that,
I'm afraid of being separated from you.

432
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,190
Then why didn't you ask me
to leave with you?

433
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,920
I knew you wouldn't leave.

434
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,790
The Mr. Meng I admire

435
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,240
is a man of honor.

436
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,810
There's no way you'd abandon them
in the heat of battle.

437
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,120
Why hasn't Father come to pick me up yet?

438
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,350
Could it be
that the letter hasn't arrived?

439
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,840
That shouldn't be the case.

440
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,790
Forget it, I'll just leave on my own.

441
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,270
It's not what you think.

442
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,640
How long has it been
since you all came back?

443
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,070
I was just tidying up the room.

444
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,330
This place is so dusty.

445
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,920
Hey, what are those looks for?

446
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,590
We've been through so much together.

447
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,310
Even though you three tricked me before,

448
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,640
my feelings for you have always been real.

449
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,310
You should leave.
There's no reason to stay.

450
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,750
We purposely didn't come back right away

451
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,590
to give you time to pack your things.

452
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,320
We thought you'd already gone.

453
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,240
Unexpectedly,
you've been dawdling for so long.

454
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,980
You're right to leave.

455
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,110
You're neither smart nor powerful.

456
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,790
The sect won't gain anything
with you here,

457
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,160
nor lose much without you.

458
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,200
No point sticking around
just to be cannon fodder.

459
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,600
Am I really that useless?

460
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,970
Though my power is weak,

461
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,730
I'm still a member of the sect.

462
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,630
I won't leave.

463
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,240
Just go ahead.
You really don't need to stay.

464
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,750
You've always been timid;
everyone will understand.

465
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,680
Valuing life and fearing death
is not a sin.

466
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,210
The seniors and juniors
will all understand.

467
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,750
Do you really see me as such a coward?

468
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,480
Maybe I was once, but not anymore.

469
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,440
I won't leave.

470
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,920
Well, it's good you're staying.

471
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
If you'd left,

472
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,550
the three of us would've had to
guard the mountain gate for you.

473
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,070
Remember to get up early tomorrow.

474
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,330
The mountain gate needs you, Jiang Bian.

475
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,380
Let's go.
There are urgent matters outside.

476
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,920
The great battle is approaching;
we can't afford to slack off.

477
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,720
Elder Xuan Wei has called a meeting
for all high-level disciples

478
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,030
to discuss our strategy against the enemy.
We mustn't be late.

479
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,510
Right.

480
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,260
We'll go first.

481
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,650
I was just impulsive for a moment.

482
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:44,860
[Prosperity]

483
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,000
Hanlin Dagger:

484
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,350
Forged from the heart-shielding scale
of an ancient true dragon.

485
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,350
When blooded,
its spiritual energy is unmatched,

486
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,050
capable of harming anything in this world—
even ancient gods.

487
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,110
Blood Chime:

488
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,110
A mystical chime
imbued with enchantment power.

489
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,480
When blood from birds, beasts,
humans, gods, ghosts, or monsters

490
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
is dripped onto it,

491
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,480
they become bound to its will.

492
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,320
Great Wilderness Stele:

493
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,070
A powerful stele that captures souls
and traps primordial spirits.

494
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,690
Those who enter the stele are as if
stepping into an illusory barrier.

495
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,880
The illusion is created
by the caster's will—

496
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,050
with a single thought,
it can transform into countless forms.

497
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,310
It can place someone in a realm of bliss

498
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,160
or imprison them in an abyss of torment.

499
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,830
[Temple of the Primordial God]

500
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,340
Why do you want to spar with me?

501
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,940
Of course I want to see
how deep your cultivation has grown.

502
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,810
You need to give it your all.

503
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,340
If you're too weak,

504
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,550
your presence in the Jingyun Sect
will only hold me back.

505
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,550
Don't blame me if I have to expel you.

506
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,590
You didn't go all out.

507
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,490
How could I bear to
use my full strength against you?

508
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,920
Even so, it's quite impressive.

509
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,820
You're several times stronger than
before your foundation was damaged.

510
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,880
The one who taught you that technique
was truly kind

511
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,710
That senior

512
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,320
just couldn't bear to
let his lifelong skills

513
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,450
disappear with him.

514
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,630
Do you still want to drive me away now?

515
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
Can I even drive you away?

516
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,430
Someone's already gone down the mountain.

517
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,360
There are definitely people
who have gone down the mountain.

518
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,490
The Jingyun Sect has 3,000 disciples.

519
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,150
Not everyone is like you.

520
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,110
So, am I special to you?

521
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,660
Every disciple who joins my Jingyun Sect

522
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,320
is special to me.

523
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,360
Please punish me, Divine Lord.

524
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,630
My skills in artifact crafting
are still lacking.

525
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,090
I haven't been able to
repair this stele yet.

526
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,200
It's alright.

527
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,600
I just wanted you
to take a casual look at it anyway.

528
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,360
You may rise.

529
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,030
Divine Lord,
though I can't restore the stele itself,

530
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,510
while studying it,

531
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,660
I uncovered a complex formation.

532
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,710
I believe

533
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,030
this formation

534
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,960
is the key to
how the Great Wilderness Stele was made.

535
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,190
Each line on it

536
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,150
traces the flow of spiritual energy.

537
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,550
If we can activate it,

538
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,360
we may not only
repair the Great Wilderness Stele

539
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,630
but also restore

540
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,030
the illusionary barrier it once conjured.

541
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,480
Unfortunately,
I've tried countless methods

542
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
and poured in
a great deal of spiritual energy,

543
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,010
but I still haven't been able to
activate the formation.

544
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,000
We won't be needing
the Great Wilderness Stele for now.

545
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,400
Just leave it with me for the time being.

546
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
There's no rush to repair it.

547
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,030
I have a more important task for you.

548
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,150
What is it?

549
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,060
I need you to keep an eye on Zhang Suan.

550
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,510
Is there something wrong with him?

551
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,670
Not exactly.

552
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,550
It's just that he once entered

553
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,590
an illusion I created
using the Great Wilderness Stele.

554
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,480
But according to the records,

555
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,790
that illusion shouldn't be accessible

556
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,110
to just anyone.

557
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,480
Even now, I still don't know
how he did it.

558
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,030
So just in case, I want you to watch him.

559
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,880
Yes, Divine Lord.

560
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,850
Come out.

561
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,410
My dear disciple, you're still awake?

562
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,470
What did you just call me?

563
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,760
Once a master, always a master.

564
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,280
You can't deny it now.

565
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,070
[Prosperity]

566
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,010
These past few days,

567
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,280
the seniors have been
keeping me cooped up.

568
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,320
They're afraid
I'd come out and bother you.

569
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,650
It took me a lot of effort
just to sneak out.

570
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,510
I know why they're afraid of you.

571
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,570
After all, you're the Grandmaster
of the Jingyun Sect.

572
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,530
Of course they're afraid
I'll tattle on them.

573
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,110
I'm busy. Go back to your room and drink.

574
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,920
You think I came just to drink with you?

575
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,190
I'm here to talk to you
about something important.

576
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,880
What is it?

577
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,280
What exactly happened

578
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,200
between you and the Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

579
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,310
Are you just hoping for a juicy story
to go with your drink?

580
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,990
Do you really think
I'm that kind of person?

581
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,440
I'm asking because I truly care about you.

582
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,030
I see.

583
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,000
You're too shy

584
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,030
to open up.

585
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,190
Come on, have a drink.

586
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
Once you've had a few,

587
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,030
you'll spill everything.

588
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,560
But don't worry,

589
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,550
your secrets are safe with me.

590
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,440
You have no idea how miserable I was.

591
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,150
When I was young, I liked someone.

592
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,440
I went out of my way to please him.

593
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,760
Every time I got something nice,
I'd give it to him.

594
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
And what did he do?

595
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,400
He used my gifts

596
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,800
to win over other women.

597
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,630
Don't you think that's just pathetic?

598
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,150
Look,

599
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,480
I've just told you something
this embarrassing.

600
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,800
What are you holding back?

601
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,320
Now, Canglei Palace and Jingyun Sect

602
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,660
are throwing the whole realm into chaos.

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,510
Honestly,

604
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,000
when it comes to romance,

605
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,320
can't you just sit down
and talk things through?

606
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,880
Why resort to violence?

607
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,420
This is none of your business.

608
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,360
Are you dense?

609
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,690
If I don't bring it up,
who else would dare to ask you about it?

610
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,670
When you married into Canglei Palace,

611
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,230
I already thought it was a mistake.

612
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,560
And I still think so now.

613
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,920
You are my mas—

614
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,710
No. That's not right.

615
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,360
I am your master.

616
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,840
Remember,
don't keep everything bottled up inside.

617
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,150
You

618
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,440
are someone who has a master.

619
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,920
Alright, I'll tell you.

620
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,030
In the beginning, all was chaos.

621
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,770
The Primordial God forged the world.

622
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,660
Bai Jiusi and I were born from
the vital energy within his divine gaze.

623
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,880
When we first gained enlightenment,

624
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,540
he was in the far north,
and I was in the far south.

625
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,510
In this vast world,

626
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,890
he is the only one I can truly sense.

627
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,400
Time flies like an arrow.

628
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,020
Thousands of years passed
in the blink of an eye.

629
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,000
I've met many people—

630
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,400
men and women, old and young,

631
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,160
beautiful and ugly.

632
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,150
But none of them was the one I sensed

633
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,440
in the midst of chaos.

634
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:40,100
♪ Pressing to my ear, brushing slowly ♪

635
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,660
♪ Heartbeat drowns out
the quickened breathing ♪

636
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,660
Then I finally arrived in the frozen land

637
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,110
and met Bai Jiusi.

638
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:58,490
♪ Intertwined, we burn ♪

639
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,940
♪ No one escapes death ♪

640
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:14,860
♪ Fate begins and ends,
just karma at play ♪

641
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:28,170
♪ So why care about what others say? ♪

642
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,480
The moment I saw him, I knew

643
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,960
I liked him.

644
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,710
I wanted to be with him.
