[FEUD]

2
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,950
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,560
Something's wrong.

4
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,450
What happened?

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200
When I arrived at Jingyun Sect,

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
Xuan Wei and the others had returned.

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,310
They activated the protection formation,

8
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,430
trapping Long Yuan and the immortal troops

9
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,200
inside.

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,790
The formation seems to have been
created by Divine Lord Siling.

11
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,200
It's incredibly powerful.

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
Even Long Yuan can't break through it.

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,870
Moreover,

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,889
that formation
also weakens one's power.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,520
That…

16
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,240
If this goes on much longer,

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,400
I'm afraid Long Yuan's power
will be completely drained.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,660
How could this happen?

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,970
I only know medicine, not formations.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,290
I'll stay to watch over Master.

21
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,470
You go gather people
to break the formation and save Long Yuan.

22
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,150
Well...

23
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,610
Master is now unconscious.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,570
We can't let anything happen to Long Yuan.

25
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,430
We're willing to go with you.

26
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,280
Alright.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,490
Let's go.

28
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,190
Indeed.

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,870
What kind of evil spirit would dare
to kill Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

30
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,800
You should know,

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,240
in all the Nine Heavens,
Three Realms, and Six Paths,

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,140
the only one who dares to kill you,

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,520
wants to kill you,

34
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,710
and can kill you

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,560
is me.

36
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,960
Over the past six years,

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,760
anyone who showed me kindness
died a tragic death.

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,880
So this is what you call
the suffering of the mortal realm?

39
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,770
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,
you sure are fragile.

40
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,800
This is just the way of the mortal realm,
not even real suffering.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,030
If you hate me this much,
why not just kill me?

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,160
Why lower yourself

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,150
to play along with me for six years?

44
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,750
I tried to kill you directly,

45
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,079
but you're too powerful.

46
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,870
I couldn't do it.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,870
So I had to trap
your primordial spirit here…

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,130
and cheat you out of
your Life-Protecting Pearl.

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,079
Only then could I make a move.

50
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,280
There were no six years.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
It was only six days.

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,850
It was really hard for me
to spend six days with you

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,600
despite my disgust.

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,390
Six days?

55
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,120
This is an illusion?

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
That's right.

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,960
This is just an illusion,

58
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,000
one I especially crafted for you.

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,520
What's wrong?

60
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,880
Don't tell me you actually fell for me.

61
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,190
If so, you must be heartbroken.

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,360
Everything here is fake.

63
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,620
The sun, the moon, and the stars are fake.

64
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,870
The buildings are fake.

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,600
Even the crowds of people

66
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
are fake too.

67
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,800
In this place,

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,040
the only real thing
is my desire to kill you.

69
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,980
No wonder when I said I saw Zhang Suan,

70
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,550
you told me that was impossible.

71
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,870
Turns out everything here is your setup.

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,000
Lin Fan, Scholar Kong,

73
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,440
even the old man at the flatbread shop—

74
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,200
they were all part of your plan
to lure me in.

75
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,710
You hate me so much.

76
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,360
You don't just want me dead.

77
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,630
You want me to suffer.

78
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,690
But the pain you've endured

79
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,430
isn't even a fraction

80
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,230
of what I went through back then.

81
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,520
How did I make you suffer?

82
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,920
Life is hard for everyone,
but even more so for women,

83
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,230
especially those
without family to protect them.

84
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,070
They're like candlelight in the dark,
faint and fragile,

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
drawing wolves from every direction.

86
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,690
Shi Hua was you.

87
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,270
You finally get it.

88
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,870
Shi Hua…

89
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,220
means "is Hua."

90
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,280
That was your past self.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
Haven't you always asked me

92
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,920
what happened during those ten years

93
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
when my power was sealed?

94
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,680
I've been telling you all along.

95
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
You just didn't understand.

96
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,240
This whole illusion is your trap for me.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,060
What about Lin Tao?

98
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,690
He was fake too?

99
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,720
Haven't you guessed?

100
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,270
You and I…

101
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,360
we once had a child.

102
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,840
I knew giving up without a fight
wasn't your style.

103
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,220
That day, you let yourself get caught

104
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
because you heard me say
we found His Lordship

105
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
and he was unconscious, right?

106
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,440
Ling'er,

107
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,330
even now, you still want
to go after His Lordship?

108
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,790
The Divine Lord destroyed
her physical body because of Bai Jiusi.

109
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,320
This is the perfect chance.

110
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,480
I must make him feel what it's like

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,790
to have only his primordial spirit left.

112
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,240
You...

113
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,650
Siling has really messed with your mind.

114
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,670
We've chosen our sides.
No need to say more.

115
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,390
Are you really going to protect him?

116
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,120
Ling'er,

117
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,390
the Heavenly Lord is my master,

118
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,200
and you're my daughter.

119
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,130
Don't put me on the spot, will you?

120
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,380
On the spot?

121
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,720
When have you ever been on the spot?

122
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,200
You never chose me anyway.

123
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll say it one last time—

124
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,080
step away.

125
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,490
Then you'll have to kill me first.

126
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,470
You think I don't dare?

127
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,840
A child...

128
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,720
We had a child?

129
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,710
No.

130
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
That's not possible.

131
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,400
You're lying, right?

132
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
Bai Jiusi,

133
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,480
you should be thanking me.

134
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,720
You didn't deserve to see Shi'an,

135
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,720
let alone hear him call you Dad.

136
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
But I relented.

137
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,680
I wanted to fulfill his wish
in this illusion.

138
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,440
No.

139
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,840
Impossible.

140
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,100
You must be lying to me.

141
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,000
You just want to hurt me.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
You just want me dead.

143
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,670
You're lying, aren't you?

144
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,130
You're lying, aren't you?

145
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,710
Tell me you're lying!

146
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,030
You're so cold-hearted.

147
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,320
Can you even feel pain?

148
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,000
You…

149
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,960
Time's up.

150
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,910
Bai Jiusi.

151
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,570
It's time for you to die.

152
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,320
Immortal Lords.

153
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,930
Give me the Hanlin Dagger, please.

154
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,750
I'll tell them
this is all a misunderstanding.

155
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,000
Stop fooling around.

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,720
I'm begging you. Be a good girl.

157
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,450
Give it to me.

158
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,600
Are you out of your mind?

159
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,670
This…

160
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,570
What happened to His Lordship?

161
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
Tell me.

162
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,440
We once had a child?

163
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,080
What happened?

164
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,720
It was you!

165
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,200
You killed him.

166
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,360
Bai Jiusi.

167
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,150
Let's die together.

168
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,270
This stone tablet was glowing dimly,

169
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,030
so I let you come in to take a look.

170
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,480
Why did you break it
the moment you touched it?

171
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,280
I just pulled it out, that's all.

172
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
I don't know why it broke.

173
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,270
Nonsense.

174
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
I pounded on it so many times
and couldn't break it.

175
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,540
You must have used spiritual energy.

176
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,160
I didn't do anything.

177
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,980
Senior Shangguan!

178
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,960
Senior.

179
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,160
Shut up.

180
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,070
If you stop me from saving Master again,

181
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,200
I'll beat you up too.

182
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,120
What do you want? Don't come any closer.

183
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,510
I'm Grandmaster's most beloved disciple.

184
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,550
If you dare to hurt me,

185
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,410
she'll surely tear you to pieces!

186
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,920
Senior.

187
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,720
Senior.

188
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,840
Senior Meng!

189
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,550
I'm the head disciple of Jingyun Sect.

190
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,340
My parents died when I was little.

191
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,530
I joined the sect at five

192
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,070
and trained under the Sect Leader.

193
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,200
Thanks to the sect's guidance,

194
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,680
I found the right path to cultivation.

195
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,790
I'm your senior.

196
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,200
I've received more
than any of you ever have.

197
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,880
If anyone's going to die,

198
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,680
it should be me first.

199
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,960
Long Yuan,
with that weak magic of yours,

200
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,440
you're barely tickling me.

201
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
You asked for it.

202
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,830
Senior!

203
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Senior!

204
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,160
Senior!

205
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,750
Senior, that's enough.

206
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,910
Take him away.

207
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,310
Senior!

208
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
Be they mortal

209
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,160
or immortal,

210
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
anyone who messes with us

211
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,510
must die!

212
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,490
[Temple of the Primordial God]

213
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,480
I told you,

214
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
you're not allowed in.

215
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,070
Senior!

216
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,150
[Temple of the Primordial God]

217
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,200
You younger ones
may not be great at magic,

218
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,060
but you sure know
how to get under people's skin.

219
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,270
-No!
-Stop, Long Yuan!

220
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,270
Grandmaster.

221
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,400
Siling!

222
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,200
Get lost.

223
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,240
Senior Zhang.

224
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,880
What happened?

225
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,400
Those from Canglei Palace did it?

226
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,480
Yes. Fortunately, Grandmaster returned

227
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,590
and drove off Long Yuan and the others.

228
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,390
Grandmaster?

229
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,840
You mean Qingyue returned?

230
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,920
Watch your tongue, Senior Zhang.
You can't call Grandmaster by name.

231
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,650
Where is she?

232
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,790
Senior Meng Chu is severely injured.

233
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,070
Grandmaster is healing him.

234
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,750
They should be in the disciples' quarters.

235
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,280
Alright.

236
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,480
You…

237
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,740
I have to say Long Yuan is quite powerful.

238
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,700
He's wounded you so badly.

239
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't use magic for now.

240
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,920
Focus on your recovery.

241
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,200
Thank you, Grandmaster.

242
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,530
You're injured. No need for formalities.

243
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,920
Have they all returned?

244
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,240
They're all waiting outside the hall.

245
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,690
Master, Grandmaster is here.

246
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,880
Welcome back, Grandmaster.

247
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,480
Master, your safe return

248
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,790
is a blessing to Jingyun Sect.

249
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,750
What a pity.

250
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,440
We missed the chance to kill Bai Jiusi.

251
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,830
We'll get another chance.

252
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,480
After a few rounds,

253
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,110
it turns out
Canglei Palace isn't so tough.

254
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,350
With Grandmaster here,

255
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,070
I believe we'll succeed soon.

256
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,510
Master, what's your plan

257
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,880
for dealing with Canglei Palace?

258
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,160
You've all worked hard these years.

259
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,090
I wouldn't have made it back safely

260
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,610
without your efforts.

261
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,440
This battle has damaged
Bai Jiusi's spiritual energy

262
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,640
and weakened him.

263
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,070
But Canglei Palace will no doubt
tighten their defenses.

264
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,070
We must remain alert
and guard the mountain gate well.

265
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,880
Please see to it yourselves.

266
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,790
Yes, Grandmaster.

267
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:43,680
You may leave.

268
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,960
Yes.

269
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,510
Master.

270
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,230
My Lord, you're back.

271
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,960
Master.

272
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,590
Your primordial spirit was separated
from your body for so long.

273
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,200
Are you feeling unwell?

274
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,510
Siling is cunning and vicious.

275
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,810
This time, she harmed your immortal body

276
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,770
and defied the immortals' authority.

277
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,460
We can't just let it slide!

278
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,820
Master, please give the order

279
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,470
to capture her and bring her to justice.

280
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,350
No one is to touch her.

281
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,930
I have my own plans for this matter.

282
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,480
All of you, leave.

283
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,110
Master!

284
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,400
Leave!

285
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,030
Come on, let's go.

286
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,640
Come on.

287
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,110
How is Master?

288
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,750
I wonder what kind of spell

289
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,410
that witch has cast on Master.

290
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,110
Master said no one is to touch her.

291
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,600
Don't act on your own.

292
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
You're back.

293
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Yes, Divine Lord.

294
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,590
I told you before to stay at Jingyun Sect.

295
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,790
Until I returned,

296
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,920
you weren't to look for me
or act on your own.

297
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,180
Why didn't you listen?

298
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,800
Please punish me, Divine Lord.

299
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,440
At first, I followed Zhang Suan

300
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,240
to Songhe County to look for you.

301
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,240
But then…

302
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,570
then my father tricked me into going back.

303
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,830
I didn't know your full plan,

304
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,720
but when I heard Canglei Palace

305
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,850
had found Bai Jiusi,

306
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,510
I thought I could take the chance

307
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,840
to get rid of him for you.

308
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,130
I'm not blaming you.

309
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,400
But working for me

310
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,440
means you're now Canglei Palace's enemy.

311
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
I told you to stay at Jingyun Sect

312
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,400
because people here could protect you.

313
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,970
Those around Bai Jiusi
are not ordinary people.

314
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,680
I'll take his life myself.

315
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,200
I know you meant well.

316
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,720
Just don't act on your own again.

317
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,960
Good thing you met your father this time.

318
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,200
If it had been someone else,

319
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,460
you might not have made it out unscathed.

320
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,860
Divine Lord,
you don't need to speak for him.

321
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,240
He only ever thinks about himself.

322
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,350
It's not my place to say too much
about you and your father.

323
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,310
Just remember—

324
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,200
don't risk yourself again.

325
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,070
Yes, Divine Lord.

326
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,800
Grandmaster,
Zhang Suan is here to see you.

327
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,400
I see. You may go.

328
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Go get some rest.

329
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,270
Yes.

330
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,270
I was just about to look for you too.

331
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,550
Are you Divine Lord Siling or Li Qingyue?

332
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,590
I'm both.

333
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,480
So those 11 years at Jingyun Sect…

334
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,410
It was all an act.

335
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,030
So you were pretending to care for me?

336
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,400
I don't need to explain

337
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,480
my actions to a disciple.

338
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,000
But since you've always been loyal,

339
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,270
I'll let your disrespect today slide.

340
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,200
You're quick

341
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,240
to call me loyal.

342
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,790
Doesn't that just mean

343
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,650
you know I'm not just loyal to you?

344
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,550
Loyal or not, it means nothing to me.

345
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,830
Last time in the Nine Heavens,

346
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,720
you came to Canglei Palace to save me.

347
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,070
I noticed your magic had greatly improved.

348
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,550
You could even
take two moves from Bai Jiusi.

349
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,350
Did something happen to you?

350
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,360
I met someone in the Nine Heavens.

351
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,070
Who?

352
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,110
Xingman.

353
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,920
Are you still mad at me?

354
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,760
Meng Chu still
hasn't come looking for you.

355
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,360
This proves he can't
bring himself to leave his sect.

356
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
In his heart,

357
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,280
Jingyun Sect means more than you do.

358
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,110
But he's just a man.

359
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,210
If you're that into him,

360
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,230
I'll go kidnap him for you

361
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,020
and lock him in your room.
How about that?

362
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,840
Enough already.

363
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,890
I'm counting to three.

364
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,710
If you don't get up,

365
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,340
don't blame me for getting rough.

366
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,190
One.

367
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,360
Two. Three.

368
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,760
You ingrate!

369
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,280
Raising you was a waste of time!

370
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,630
Xiao Jingshan?

371
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,030
You know him?

372
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,090
I never met him, but I've heard of him.

373
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,760
500 years ago,

374
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,800
he tried to destroy the Infinite Stele

375
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,460
and was captured by Bai Jiusi.

376
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,690
Later, the Heavenly Emissary
ordered him imprisoned.

377
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
He's dead now?

378
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,480
Yes.

379
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,210
I saw it with my own eyes.

380
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,130
I even made a tombstone for him.

381
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,630
You think something's off?

382
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,590
Not really.

383
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,030
It's good that
your foundation has been restored.

384
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,760
Just now, Ling'er told me

385
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,960
you two went to
Songhe County to look for me.

386
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,840
Was it you who broke the illusion

387
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,000
I set up there?

388
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,150
You mean…

389
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
the Great Wilderness Stele, right?

390
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,710
How do you know
it's the Great Wilderness Stele?

391
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,710
I read about it once

392
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,230
in a book in the library.

393
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,760
I must've casually

394
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,220
tossed that book in there.

395
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,440
If I remember right, it didn't mention
how to break the formation.

396
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,480
How did you do it?

397
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,850
I honestly don't know.

398
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,940
I just gave it a gentle tug.

399
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,560
It came out of the ground and shattered.

400
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,760
Bai Jiusi said

401
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,040
he saw you in Songhe County.

402
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,710
Do you remember that?

403
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,960
That's true.

404
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,960
I did see him there.

405
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,400
Before I could do anything,

406
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,230
he vanished.

407
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,440
The Stele could only be controlled
by the one who activated it.

408
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Without my help, how did you get in?

409
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,710
Meng Chu!

410
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,280
Meng Chu, come out!

411
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,220
Meng Chu!

412
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,880
I told you to stop coming here.

413
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,140
Can't you understand?

414
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,440
If it weren't for Mr. Meng,

415
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
you think I'd bother to come to this dump?

416
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,280
Dump?

417
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
We're an immortal sect now.

418
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,630
Even a janitor here
could beat you to death.

419
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,880
Like we haven't fought before.

420
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,030
Don't act like I don't know

421
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,510
just how weak Jingyun Sect is.

422
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,190
Stop bragging here.

423
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,550
If you don't let me in,

424
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,280
I'll bring the entire Yinlian Sect
to crush your mountain gate.

425
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,150
Ridiculous.

426
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,230
Even Long Yuan couldn't get past our gate,

427
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,320
and you think you can?

428
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,280
Long Yuan?

429
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,230
Which no-name sect is he from?

430
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,230
You've never heard of Long Yuan?

431
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,000
Listen up.

432
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,070
He's the head disciple
of Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

433
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,070
With a flick of his finger,
he can level many cities.

434
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,920
Against me,

435
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,050
he couldn't last more than 30 minutes.

436
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,960
Scared now?

437
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,110
I was, until you said

438
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,110
that last part.

439
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,350
Grandmaster.

440
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,360
Zhang Suan.

441
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,480
I knew you were trustworthy.

442
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,350
You're here to pick me up, right?

443
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,070
I remember you.

444
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,590
You're that disciple I injured.

445
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,630
You know, I didn't mean to hurt you.

446
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,360
It was that scheming girl, Lyu Suguan,

447
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,820
who pulled you
in front of her to take the hit.

448
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,150
How are you? All healed up?

449
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,340
How about this?

450
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,760
Go pass a message to Meng Chu for me.

451
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,920
Have him wait for me at the mountain gate.

452
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,630
If you help me today,

453
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,440
you'll be my sidekick from now on.

454
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,320
In all 12 provinces of Han,

455
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,670
I'll have your back.

456
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,820
You can strut around wherever you go.

457
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,330
How do you plan to have my back?

458
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,800
You can do whatever you want.

459
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,760
"Do whatever you want."

460
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,360
Oh, right.

461
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,360
If anyone messes with you,
just give them my full name.

462
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,280
If they still dare to act up,

463
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,230
you come tell me.

464
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,070
I'll beat them to a pulp

465
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,880
and make them regret
being born in the 12 provinces of Han.

466
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,920
You sound really powerful.

467
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,840
Of course.

468
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,630
I'm the head of Yinlian Sect.

469
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,510
Have you heard of the Yinlian Sect?

470
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,070
No.

471
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,870
You never heard of Yinlian Sect?

472
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,440
No wonder you're stuck here

473
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,110
as a low-ranking disciple.

474
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,990
You can't even beat
someone as inept as Lyu Suguan.

475
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,480
But

476
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,920
your outfit today…

477
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,840
Never mind. Enough talking.

478
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,370
Just go find Mr. Meng for me.

479
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,070
Tell Meng Chu to come out and shut her up.

480
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,000
Junior, why are you in here?

481
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,880
Senior, this is Heart-Calming Decoction.

482
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,350
I added lovage
and schizonepeta for you.

483
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,710
It's great for replenishing qi and blood.

484
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,310
I made it especially for you.

485
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,450
Please, drink some.

486
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,400
No, Junior.

487
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,130
Men and women should keep their distance.

488
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,760
Besides, I'm getting changed.
This really isn't appropriate.

489
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,320
What do you mean "keep their distance"?

490
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,360
What's not appropriate?

491
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,620
We never used to mind such things as kids.

492
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Why are you suddenly concerned now?

493
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,540
You're just afraid

494
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,320
that demon girl of yours will mind.

495
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,550
Yes.

496
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,020
I am afraid Xingman will mind.

497
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,150
Junior, I already have someone I love.

498
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,750
Stop wasting your time on me.

499
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,280
There are so many
fine disciples in Jingyun Sect.

500
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,360
And if not here, look elsewhere.

501
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,850
You'll surely find the right one for you.

502
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,800
Why can't you get over me?

503
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,590
I don't care about anyone else.

504
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,230
Even if Heavenly Lord Dacheng were here,

505
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,630
he wouldn't catch my eye.

506
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,480
In my heart,

507
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,320
there's only you.

508
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,660
If you won't accept me,

509
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,700
then I'll wait.

510
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,590
I can wait for thousands of years.

511
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,710
One day, you'll turn around.

512
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,550
Don't.

513
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,150
Senior.

514
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,960
Jiang Bian, you need something?

515
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,710
Yeah, Senior Meng.

516
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,880
That demon girl is here for you.

517
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,590
She's outside the mountain gate now,

518
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,760
yelling her lungs out.

519
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,150
She's been yelling for four whole hours.

520
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,440
Even Grandmaster has been disturbed.

521
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,670
Senior, Senior!

522
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,590
I'll drink it.

523
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,000
Get lost!

524
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,670
Okay.

525
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,360
Senior!

526
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,370
[Temple of the Primordial God]

527
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,630
I'll keep
the Great Wilderness Stele for now.

528
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,560
I'll have Ling'er try to repair it.

529
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,680
You go to the library

530
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,550
and find that book you read before.

531
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,550
Okay.

532
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,440
Did I mess up your plan?

533
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,360
It was an honest mistake.

534
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,560
How could I blame you?

535
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,870
Maybe I overlooked something
when I read the book.

536
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,840
Okay.

537
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,820
After this battle,

538
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,330
Canglei Palace surely won't let this go.

539
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,040
Have you thought of what to do next?

540
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,150
Bai Jiusi has always been
proud and arrogant.

541
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,400
Now that I've given him such a blow,

542
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,760
there's no way he'll back down easily.

543
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,510
But his primordial spirit
has taken serious damage.

544
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,110
He's no longer a match for me.

545
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,400
True.

546
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,120
He's proud and aloof,

547
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,730
but he does have…

548
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,330
some affection for you.

549
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,760
For a young boy,
you seem to know quite a bit.

550
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,320
Don't be too curious.

551
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,920
Some things aren't meant for you to know.

552
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,280
How should I address you from now on?

553
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,280
