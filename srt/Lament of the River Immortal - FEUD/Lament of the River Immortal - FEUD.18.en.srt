[Episode 18]

3
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,840
What do we do?

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,509
The fire's huge.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,840
What about the people inside?

6
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,590
Someone's in there.

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,460
Someone help!

8
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,750
Someone help!

9
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,180
Someone help!

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,070
Hang in there, Goldie!

11
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,840
Darling.

12
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,320
Goldie.

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,750
-Yue.
-Let me do it.

14
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,730
Mr. Lin, it's dangerous in there!

15
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,450
Darling.

16
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,560
-It's too dangerous.
-Mr. Lin.

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,120
Darling!

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Be careful!

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,870
Mr. Lin!

20
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,440
It's too dangerous!

21
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,310
Be careful, Mr. Lin!

22
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,470
It's too dangerous!

23
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,120
Yue,

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,590
why did you come here alone?

25
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,120
Where is Mr. Bai?
Did he go in to fight the fire?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,840
Mrs. Lin.

27
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,800
Mrs. Lin.

28
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Is she okay?

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,380
Get some sleep.

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Last night, the pancake shop caught fire.

31
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,840
You were in the courtyard.

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,590
You should've seen the flames first.

33
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,050
Why didn't you try to help?

34
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,880
Was it so hard to grab a bucket
and help like everyone else?

35
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,960
The old man in the pancake shop—
his time was up.

36
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,420
It was destined
to be his last day yesterday.

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,240
Even if the fire
hadn't taken him last night,

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,370
he likely would've died in his dreams.

39
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
Either way, he wouldn't
have lived past midnight.

40
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,390
That's heaven's will.

41
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,649
No one could've saved him.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
Not even an immortal.

43
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,430
There you go again.

44
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,680
You say the old man's time was up,

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,260
but what about Lin Fan?

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,020
How could you just sit back
and watch him die an untimely death?

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,130
Fate is not to be defied.

48
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,520
When the time comes,
all efforts are meaningless.

49
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,360
Your cold, heartless nature

50
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,300
hasn't changed at all.

51
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,680
It was heaven that took him, not me.

52
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,620
If Lin Fan heard you say that,

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,600
do you think he'd regret

54
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
ever opening his heart to you

55
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,930
and considering you a friend?

56
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,830
Yue, Mr. Bai,

57
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,870
are you

58
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,630
arguing because of my husband?

59
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,690
The physician said you need rest.

60
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,840
Yue, please don't blame Mr. Bai.

61
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,950
It was my husband
who chose to go in and save people.

62
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,310
No one else is at fault.

63
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,570
My husband…

64
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,550
He...

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,870
He was just really foolish.

66
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,560
He knew it was impossible,

67
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,300
but he'd still do it.

68
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,470
He knew it was dangerous,

69
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,920
but he still went.

70
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,270
He always said, "Do all you can
before leaving it to fate."

71
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,080
As long as there was a glimmer of hope,
he wouldn't give up.

72
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,560
That was what I liked most about him.

73
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,480
When Tao

74
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,370
comes to this world,

75
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,310
he'll surely be proud of his father,

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,560
Yue.

77
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,090
Mr. Bai

78
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,900
was my husband's best friend.

79
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,250
Now that he's gone,

80
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,400
he wouldn't want you two
to fight because of him.

81
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,040
Alright, we won't fight.

82
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,370
Let me walk you back to your room.

83
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,360
Let's go.

84
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,110
What's wrong?

85
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,110
What's happening?

86
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,760
I... I...

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Push again.

88
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,760
Push harder.

89
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,650
Almost there.

[Lin Residence]

91
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,210
Almost there, almost there.

92
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,530
God, open your eyes and look!

93
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,659
Please, let good people be rewarded.

94
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
This is so cruel.

95
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,050
Mr. Lin just passed away,

96
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,070
and now his wife
and child are in danger too.

97
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,040
Indeed.

98
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,920
Ms. Wang, how is Mrs. Lin doing?

99
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,920
It's not good.

100
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,610
The baby's stuck. It's a difficult birth.

101
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,330
Go get Physician Xu.

102
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,510
If anything happens, we need him ready.

103
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,110
Alright, I'll go right away.

104
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,050
How are you feeling?

105
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,680
What are you doing?

106
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,310
Cut open my belly.

107
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,870
But that'll kill you.

108
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,160
Save the baby.

109
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,190
Please, let Mrs. Lin
and the baby make it through this.

110
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,520
Please let them be safe.

111
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,430
Children are so adorable.

112
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,270
How about we have one too?

113
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,040
Bai, do you think I could be

114
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,310
a good father?

115
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Save the baby.

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,560
Then it was heaven's will for him to die.

117
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,690
I wanted him to live!

118
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,570
I couldn't just let him die.

119
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,350
If I fought to save him and failed,

120
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,750
then it was fate's fault!

121
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,960
Mr. Bai

122
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,230
was my husband's best friend.

123
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,410
-This way.
-It's out.

124
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,000
The baby is out!

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,030
It's out, finally!

126
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,300
They're both safe.

127
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,880
Thank heaven. That's great!

128
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,300
Great! Great!

129
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,780
Her kindness has been rewarded.
It's a miracle.

130
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,760
Bai Jiusi.

131
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,330
Bai Jiusi, I know you're in there.

132
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,020
Yesterday at Lin Fan's place,

133
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,080
I sensed a surge of spiritual energy.

134
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,810
You must have used magic to help Shi Hua.

135
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,240
The backlash from magic is no joke.

136
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,470
I'll be right outside.

137
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,440
If you need anything, let me know.

[Hongmeng Hall]

139
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,150
Father, Mother, I hope you are both well.

140
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,240
Come to think of it,

141
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
it's been two months

142
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,090
since I last sent a letter home.

143
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,910
I wonder if you're upset with me.

144
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,750
When Father sent me up the mountain,

145
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,000
it was for me to become immortal

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
and gain true knowledge

147
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,440
so I could escape
the pain of the mortal world

148
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
and find the Dao to live an eternal life.

149
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,300
But now, the Jingyun Sect
is no longer what it used to be.

150
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,480
Not long ago,

151
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,960
my junior Li Qingyue, who used to
guard the mountain gate with me,

152
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,150
suddenly became Divine Lord Siling.

153
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,630
She even fought
Heavenly Lord Dacheng on Tianmu Peak.

154
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,150
In the end,
they shattered the void and fell.

155
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,470
No one knows where they ended up.

156
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,520
Since then,

157
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,120
the people in the sect
have been acting strangely

158
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,240
and speaking nonsense.

159
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,170
They claim that

160
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,630
the Jingyun Sect
is the number one sect in the six realms,

161
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,030
always talking about
attacking the Nine Heavens

162
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,090
to challenge the immortals up there.

163
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,230
This kind of aggressive mindset

164
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,910
really doesn't align
with the values Father taught me.

165
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,120
So I hope, Father,

166
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,630
you can bring me home

167
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,030
and guide me properly.

168
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,080
That way,
I might find clarity in my heart.

169
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,670
So annoying!

170
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,910
I'm craving knowledge
like a starving man craves food.

171
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,480
I hope you and Mother
can come see me soon.

172
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,330
Jiang Bian.

173
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,360
Coming.

174
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,200
Coming.

175
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,960
Junior Song, what's the matter?

176
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,750
What else?

177
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,560
Go guard the mountain gate.

178
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,390
But I was on duty yesterday!

179
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,790
Why is it me again today?

180
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,150
The Sect Leader has taken all the elders

181
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,550
and disciples down the mountain.

182
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,840
Now in the Jingyun Sect,

183
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,320
only we juniors are left.

184
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,070
If you don't go, who will?

185
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,270
Isn't there anyone else in this big sect?

186
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,840
Hasn't Senior Meng Chu been released?

187
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Send him instead!

188
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,750
He's probably leaving too.

189
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,400
Where can he even go?

190
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,910
He lost his parents as a child,

191
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,480
and his whole village was wiped out.

192
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,320
Where can he go?

193
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,920
The Yinlian Sect, of course.

194
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,870
What about Senior Zhang Suan?

195
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,120
Senior Zhang…

196
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,080
It's been three days.

197
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,240
Have you decided where to look?

198
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,890
If you don't want to find her,
stop following me.

199
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
I do want to find her.

200
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,550
It's just that you're running around
like a headless chicken.

201
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,630
Totally aimless.

202
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm not aimless.

203
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,270
I just want
to search every possible place.

204
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,120
Now I'm even more curious

205
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,180
about your past with the Divine Lord.

206
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,200
You're so loyal to her.

207
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,750
Robbery!

208
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,030
Give us all your money!

209
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,330
If you dare resist,

210
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,030
this little mountain trail

211
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,560
will be your burial ground.

212
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,640
Why are you laughing?

213
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,790
These days,

214
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,080
even small-time thugs

215
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,740
can come out and make trouble.

216
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,240
Go away!

218

220
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,250

221
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,580
We're sorry.

222
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,410
-We're sorry.
-Please spare us.

223

227

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,510
I...

229
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,630
Wait.

230
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,190
Give me that.

231
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,320
You two.

232
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,020
Do you know the way down the mountain?

233
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,870
Yes, yes.

234
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,600
You...

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,870
No one knows this area better than us.

236
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,630
There are three paths down.

237
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,080
-Three.
-The first

238
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,720
is the one you two came up.

239
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
The second

240
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,360
cuts through the Stone Forest ahead
and leads straight north.

241
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,910
As for the third, I really advise you

242
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,150
not to take it.

243
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,120
Why not?

244
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,390
Because that path leads to Songhe County.

245
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,600
Yes, yes.

246
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,920
There are evil spirits there.

247
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,750
Many people have died there.

248
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,470
It was even frozen over a while ago.

249
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,440
No one's lived there in ages.

250
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,600
They say

251
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,660
whoever goes there never comes back.

252
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,350
Sir, madam, take my advice.

253
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,730
Don't take that path.

254
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,850
This way, please.

255
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,030
Boss, we've got two guests.

256
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,280
Coming, coming!

257
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,550
Esteemed guests,

258
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,720
this is our signature dish—
bamboo shoots with chicken marrow.

259
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
All your dishes are here. Enjoy.

260
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,480
The food at Guiyun Restaurant
is said to be the best in Jingzhou.

261
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,080
If we weren't here
to hunt demons for the government,

262
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,510
we'd probably have to
cultivate for 30 years

263
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,360
before getting a chance to dine here.

264
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,090
No wonder it's their star dish.

265
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,829
It's refreshing, tender, and crisp.

266
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,160
Of course.

267
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,700
I heard this dish

268
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,740
must be made with marrow
from a 100-day-old black chicken

269
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,440
and fresh bamboo shoots from Chuzhou.

270
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,569
Only then is it considered authentic.

271
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,000
Compared with

272
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,970
Chuzhou's bamboo shoots,

273
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,790
the reed shoots
from Songhe County are much better.

274
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,790
Songhe County? Where's that?

275
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,680
"Songhe's reed shoots
shade the river isles.

276
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,640
They taste rich and tender,
even better than milk."

277
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,349
That poem

278
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,240
praises the reed shoots from Songhe,

279
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,350
saying they taste
smoother and richer than milk.

280
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,680
What poem is that?

281
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,370
I've never heard of it.

282
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,790
Junior, you didn't make it up, did you?

283
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,200
How can you say that?

284
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,770
It's not my fault that
you're undereducated.

285
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,000
That poem was written
by the great poet Duan Weijun.

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,480
Every word is recorded
in the official histories.

287
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,210
Duan Weijun?

288
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,070
Hasn't he been dead

289
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,600
for several hundred years?

290
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,820
He died hundreds of years ago?

291
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,000
So does Songhe County still exist?

292
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,880
No idea.
But if Qingyue says she's eaten there,

293
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,480
then I guess it still exists.

294

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,160
The whole courtyard was packed,

367
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,820
all asking my mom for peaches.

368
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,830
You coming or not?

369
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,710
No.

370
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,890
Fine then.

371
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,830
I'll steal two for you.

372
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm sick of them anyway.

373
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,270
Aunt Six and the others all say
I'm the God of Literature incarnate,

374
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,480
destined to be
a high-ranking official in the capital.

375
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,510
That's why our peach tree

376
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,640
blooms and bears fruit all year round.

377
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,030
My mom thinks so too.

378
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,000
She even went to
a fortune-teller in the north of the city

379
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
to get me a new name—

380
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,590
Lin Shi'an.

381
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,110
She said it means peace across the land.

382
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,840
Uncle Bai, is it a nice name?

383
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,440
Nope.

384
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Uncle Bai, I think it's not bad.

385
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,430
But I don't want to change my name.

386
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,240
I don't want to be
the God of Literature either.

387
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,880
I want to... to be a swordsman,

388
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,310
roaming the world and upholding justice.

389
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,030
Uncle Bai, look.

390
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,440
I just learned this new move.

391
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,000
It's called "Crane Spreads Wings."

392
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Isn't it awesome?

393
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,840
Uncle Bai, isn't it awesome?

394
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,310
Move aside.

395
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,920
Uncle Bai, isn't it awesome?

396
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,270
Uncle Bai, isn't it awesome?

397
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,400
Uncle Bai, wait for me!

398
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,910
[Guo's Songhe Noodles]

399
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Mr. Bai, welcome.

400
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
The usual today?

401
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,240
Have a seat.

402
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,620
Mr. Bai's usual three dishes.

403
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,510
Sir, I'd like a rice pudding

404
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,030
and a plum soup.

405
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,960
Tao,

406
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,590
why are you here freeloading again?

407
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,840
Nonsense! My family is very rich.

408
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,860
Why would I come here to freeload?

409
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,270
Besides, I've got Uncle Bai.

410
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,510
My mom says Uncle Bai's super rich.

411
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,050
He never seems
to do any real work all year,

412
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,550
but somehow his money never runs out.

413
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,530
He has more money than he can spend.

414
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,860
How's that not rich?

415
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,960
I must say, for such a little kid,

416
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,780
you sure know a lot.

417
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,920
Go sit.

418
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,490
[Guo's Songhe Noodles]

419
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,770
Is it ready?

420
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,310
Yeah.

421
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,160
Mr. Bai, your dishes.

422
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,750
Tao, your plum soup.

423
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,070
Enjoy.

424
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,590
Uncle Bai, you drink first.

425
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,440
Spill it. What did you do this time?

426
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,680
I didn't do anything.

427
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,780
Uncle Bai,

428
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,070
can you help me with something later?

429
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,310
So you are in trouble.

430
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,640
You'll see when you come with me later.

431
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,480
Only you can help with this.

432
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,420
Uncle Bai, drink, drink.

433
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,560
Uncle Bai, look, they're here.

434
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,330
Look, this is my dad.

435
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,530
Don't ever say again

436
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,880
that I don't have a dad.

437
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,150
I do have a dad!

438
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,000
He doesn't look like you at all.

439
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,130
No way he's your dad.

440
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,790
I'm young now, and I look like my mom.

441
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,550
When I grow up, I'll look like my dad!

442
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,750
I don't believe you. You're just a liar.

443
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,720
Dad, tell them.

444
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,500
You are my dad, right?

445
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,340
Run! Run! Run!

446
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,240
Run!

447

Uncle Bai, I'm really happy today.

My mom says you were my dad's best friend.

449

Can I call you Dad from now on?

Hold it yourself.

451
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,210
Uncle Bai, don't worry.

452
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,070
I'll only call you that in private.

453
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,350
No one else will know.

454
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,410
Don't worry.

455
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,710
I promise.

456
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,990
Can I, Uncle Bai?

457
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,440
Can I?

458
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,110
Uncle Bai, can I?

459
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,960
Where did you take him?

460
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,760
Shi Hua has asked several times.

461
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,210
He played for a little too long.

462
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,040
What's wrong?

463
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,680
Nothing. I'll take him to Shi Hua first.

464
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,680
Come on, get down.

465
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,330
What's the matter?

466
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,210
Is there something you're not telling me?

467
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,200
No.

468
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,170
I want some osmanthus cake.

469
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,440
Okay.

470
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,050
I'll go buy some for you.

471
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't take offense, sir.

472
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,720
She was a kind lady before death,

473
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,830
gentle by nature.

474
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,430
She wouldn't offend you.

475
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,110
You seem like a refined gentleman.

476
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,350
Are you local?

477
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,310
I'm Xiaoyaozi,

478
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,880
a wandering cultivator.

479
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,510
This is my friend,

480
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,570
Wang from Jingzhou,
also known as Mo Zhu, the Traveler.

481
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,510
Have you heard of her poems?

482
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,270
Never.

483
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,850
Let me tell you,

484
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,440
throughout her life,
she wrote countless poems.

485
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,350
They're all well-known classics.

486
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,350
Each one captures
the sorrows and truths of the world.

487
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,350
If you have time,

488
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,510
you really should read them.

489
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,680
True suffering is never shown outwardly.

490
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
How could it be expressed in poetry?

491
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,610
You may not know this, sir.

492
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,970
Mo Zhu was born into
a wealthy, scholarly family.

493
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,700
But the man she loved was a commoner.

494
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,340
Her family was firmly against it,

495
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,040
so she eloped with him.

496
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,750
Later, her husband joined the army

497
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,290
and never returned.

498
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,480
She thought he had died
and planned to follow him in death,

499
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,410
only to discover
she was already carrying his child.

500
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,960
So she had no choice

501
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,720
but to raise the child alone.

502
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,590
But the child fell ill

503
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,270
and passed away at the age of six,

504
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,960
leaving her to suffer alone in this world.

505
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,550
Not long after, she discovered that

506
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,790
her husband hadn't died in battle at all.

507
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,400
He had taken a new wife elsewhere

508
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,460
and abandoned her.

509
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,720
Crushed by grief and rage,

510
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,590
she passed away

511
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,270
on a snowy night.

512
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,550
Why didn't she go to the authorities?

513
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
The authorities?

514
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,280
Sir, you must've spent too long
in Songhe County.

515
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,240
This place is remote, right behind

516
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
the Huai Ridge,
sheltered from wind and storm.

517
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,100
It has always
had good weather and peaceful people.

518
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,810
Live here long enough,

519
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,620
and you forget
what the rest of the world is like.

520
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,000
Across the 12 prefectures of Han,

521
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,160
some suffer drought with no food to eat;

522
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,480
others drown in floods, misery everywhere.

523
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
There are even places torn apart by war,

524
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,640
where government offices have been taken.

525
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,720
So where are the people
supposed to go to seek justice?

526
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,000
Has the world always been like this?

527
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,480
Life is hard for everyone,

528
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,140
but even more so for women,

529
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,800
especially those
without family to protect them.

530
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,330
They're like candlelight in the dark,

531
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,830
so faint and fragile,
drawing wolves from every direction.

532
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,739
The night is falling.
Demons are on the move.

533
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,639
Looks like we'll need
to stay here for a few more days.

534
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,280
You truly are no ordinary man, sir.

535
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,610
Even your dog can feel something's wrong.

536
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,150
The night is long. The mist is rising.

537
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,000
I believe we'll meet again someday.

538
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,440
Mr. Bai.

539
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,480
Until next time.

540
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,230
Midnight patrol. All is safe.

541
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,440
Midnight patrol. All is safe.

542
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,670
Ghost! Ghost!

543
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,000
Ghost!

544
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,280
Ghost!

545
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,550
Help!

546
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,670
Life is hard for everyone,

547
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,170
but even more so for women,

548
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,760
especially those
without family to protect them.

549
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,610
They're like candlelight in the dark,

550
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,320
so faint and fragile,
drawing wolves from every direction.

551
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,590
What's it?

552
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,710
Didn't you say you wanted
osmanthus cake last night?

553
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,770
I couldn't buy any.

554
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,360
So I got up early

555
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,880
to go buy it with you.

556
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,150
Never mind.

557
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,230
If you want it, just say so. Don't be shy.

558
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,480
Go wash up. I'll wait at the door.

559
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,410
We're going together.

560
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,190
Here.

561
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,150
Is it good?

562
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,340
I'll buy you whatever you want to eat.

563
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,090
Make way, make way!

564
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,440
Make way!

565
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,770
Make way, make way!

566
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,550
Official investigation! Clear the way!

567
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,280
Make way, make way!

568
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,070
Move, move!

569
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,030
Okay.

570
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,290
Official investigation. Clear the way!

571
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,110
Move away!

572
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,930
Enough, stop looking.

573
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,800
Move, move!

574
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,550
Excuse me,

575
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,290
do you know why there are
so many constables up ahead?

576
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,500
You haven't heard?

577
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,760
Two people died last night.

578
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,760
People died?

579
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,010
Did they catch the killer?

580
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,170
Where would they even start looking?

581
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,150
I heard it was the work of evil spirits.

582
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,590
Really?

583
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,150
This county's been so peaceful.

584
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,950
How could there be evil spirits?

585
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,230
Not evil spirits.

586
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,620
It's just some criminal

587
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,190
using ghost stories to stir up fear.

588
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,670
You saw the bodies yourself.

589
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,280
They were completely drained.

590
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,140
No way a human could've done that.

591
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,910
Superstitious nonsense

592
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,800
is not to be believed.

593
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,550
Good day.

594
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,410
Do you think
there are really evil spirits?

595
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,370
You go back first.
I'll investigate the surroundings.

596
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,000
Bai Jiusi.

597
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,860
You're getting more and more human.

598
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,880
Mr. Bai.

599
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,550
Mr. Bai, you're back.

600
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,660
Sorry about yesterday.

601
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,150
Tao must have

602
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,880
bugged you all day again.

603
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,070
It's fine.

604
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,110
These are the pastries Qingyue likes.

605
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,480
Take them to her for me.

606
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,480
I won't go in.

607
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,330
Then let me thank you on her behalf.

608
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Look at that widow,

609
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,010
getting so close
with someone else's husband.

610
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,960
Shameless.

611
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Men just

612
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,510
love widows like her.

613
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,630
Gossipmongers!

614
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,080
You fatherless brat!

615
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,280
Mind your words!

616
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,200
-Shoo.
-Go play somewhere else.

617
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,670
What a seductress.

618
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,920
-Lin Tao.
-Look at her.

619
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,630
Exactly.

620
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,360
How have I always taught you?

621
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,690
Don't be rude like that.

622
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,920
If you're bitten by a dog,

623
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,380
will you bite the dog back?

624
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,760
Got it, Mom.

625
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Now go fetch the ball.

626
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,550
We're going home.

627
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,550
What a shameless woman.

628
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,990
Uncle Bai, you're freezing up.

629
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,960
What move was that just now?

630
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,590
Can you teach me?

631
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,400
Aunt.

632
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,960
Aunt, did you see?

633
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,150
Uncle Bai was so cool just now!

634
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,210
How are you?

635
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,590
Tao.

636
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,150
Come home with me.

637
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,480
Did you see clearly how he saved him?

638
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,190
I didn't.

639
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,030
No idea.

640
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,510
Uncle Bai is an immortal.
Did you see that?

641
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,390
Mom, Uncle Bai is an immortal.
Did you see that?

642
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,320
Ms. Wang, Uncle Bai is an immor…

643
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,930
Tao, what are you saying?

644
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,070
Nothing.

645
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,230
Tao, don't talk nonsense.

646
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,030
Let's go home.

647
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,670
Uncle Bai is an immortal.

648
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,920
Are you alright?
