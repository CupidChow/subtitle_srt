00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,940
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,680
And then?

4
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,509
Years flew by after that,

5
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,810
and somehow we started fighting.

6
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,550
We'd fight every time we met.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
But that was fine.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,010
At least it let me
see him from time to time.

9
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,360
I thought

10
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,760
we would keep fighting like this forever.

11
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,520
Until one day, he suddenly invited me to go

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,840
be a couple with him in the mortal realm

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,660
to pass the love tribulation.

14
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,600
I played it cool on the surface,

15
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,829
yet I was actually exhilarated.

16
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,360
We spent a hundred years together
in the mortal realm.

17
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,850
Despite occasional quarrels and fights,

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,870
those were my happiest days.

19
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,400
I even prayed deep down inside,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
hoping that we would never
pass this love tribulation

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
so as to live together forever.

22
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,310
But later...

23
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,590
Later, he fell in love with someone else

24
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,680
and abandoned you.

25
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,310
Then you swore to kill him for vengeance.

26
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,080
Am I right?

27
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,030
Go on.

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,590
Please continue.

29
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,960
Since birth,
I've had a soft spot for mortals.

30
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,280
But he was born aloof,

31
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,120
more like a god compared to me.

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Lofty, indifferent, and solitary,

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,740
detached from the masses.

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,250
Later, because of an incident,

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,079
he sealed my power

36
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,880
and left me in the mortal realm.

37
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,950
Not until then did I realize that

38
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,390
I was the only one who had fallen in love.

39
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,120
He spent all that time with me
just to pass the tribulation—

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,150
nothing more.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,630
You can travel through time and space
in the Three Realms.

42
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,830
Of course I can since I'm in charge
of the rising and setting

43
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,760
of the sun and moon,
the calendar of heaven and earth.

44
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,480
The universe is boundless,
unlike the Three Realms.

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,310
From primordial essence comes matter;
from matter comes space;

46
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,680
from space comes time;
from time comes everything.

47
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,430
I am the God of the Sun,

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,750
the Mother of Time.

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,760
Then can you change the past and future?

50
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,250
Everything in the world,
karma, and reincarnation

51
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,159
are all under your control.

52
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,040
Do you know

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,430
something is immutable in the cosmos?

54
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,920
The sun rises in the east
and sets in the west;

55
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,870
plants flourish in summer
and wither in autumn;

56
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,360
karma and reincarnation
occur in their own way.

57
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,800
I can travel through time and space
in the Three Realms,

58
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
in charge of the sun, moon, and stars,

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,070
but I'm merely a witness

60
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,270
of the long history.

61
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,690
Because all things in the world,
karma, and reincarnation

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,260
take their own course.

63
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,040
Then how can I see

64
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,720
the past that I wish to see?

65
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,120
Bai Jiusi, your real karma is here.

66
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,920
This is the past,

67
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,630
the ten years when you left your wife
in the mortal realm.

68
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,390
You don't belong to this time and space.

69
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,270
But you can see

70
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,730
the people and events
of this time and space.

71
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,920
However, they can't see or hear you.

72
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,830
Bai Jiusi...

73
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,870
You're such a bastard!

74
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,920
Master!

75
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,690
It's been three months.

76
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,310
You really can't drink anymore.

77
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Why can't I?

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,659
Because...

79
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,430
your mortal realm's alcohol

80
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,390
is really something great.

81
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,310
Master.

82
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,160
Master!

83
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Master!

84
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,870
Master!

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
He left.

86
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,750
He abandoned me.

87
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,390
Master! Master?

88
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,780
[Clinic]

89
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,550
Come with me.

90
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,600
Okay.

91
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
You should quit drinking from now on.

92
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,540
If you keep this up,

93
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,130
you will be totally wrecked

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,400
even though you're an immortal.

95
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Your wife is pregnant, you know?

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,670
What?

97
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,930
She's four months pregnant.
You don't know that?

98
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,480
What did you say?

99
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,910
You're already four months pregnant.

100
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,110
None of you knew that?

101
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,790
You're too careless.

102
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,500
Want to keep watching?

103
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:26,960
Yeah.

104
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,850
I want to continue.

105
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,070
You're almost there!

106
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,080
I can see the head! Just need a push.

107
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,670
There we go! The baby's out!

108
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,520
Don't cry, don't cry.

109
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,600
Come on, be good.

110
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,840
Don't cry.

111
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,630
Congratulations, it's a boy.

112
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,550
Here.

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,750
Master, it's a boy.

114
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,970
He doesn't have a name yet.

115
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,440
Let's call him Shi'an.

116
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,750
My mom thinks so too.

117
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,910
She also entrusted
a fortune-teller in the north of the city

118
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,320
to get me a new name—

119
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,390
Lin Shi'an.

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,200
She said it means "peace across the land."

121
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,600
-Don't cry.
-I'll go get you some food.

122
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Meet your mother.

123
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,910
Come on.

124
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,840
Shi'an.

125
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,390
Don't cry, good boy.

126
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,870
Don't cry, Shi'an.

127
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,630
Uncle Bai, did you see
my bamboo dragonfly?

128
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,600
I just let go,

129
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,460
and it disappeared with a whoosh.

130
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,030
Shi'an.

131
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,910
[Shi'an]

132
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,120
Shi'an!

133
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Fatherless brat.

134
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,310
Who allowed you to play here?

135
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,550
I do have a dad!

136
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,790
Don't let him go! Stop him!

137
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,510
Stop him there!

138
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,040
How dare you try to run away?

139
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Where's your father?

140
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
My father is up in heaven!

141
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,330
So he's dead, huh?

142
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,490
Says you! My father isn't dead!

143
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
Look, this is my dad.

144
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,720
Do not ever call me

145
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
a fatherless brat again!

146
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,360
I do have a dad!

147
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,080
You can find all the truths in the past.

148
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,150
Although you were born a god,

149
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,960
you cannot see all the truths.

150
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
My dad is not dead!

151
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,150
He's not!

152
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,410
Want to keep watching?

153
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,360
Continue.

154
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,000
I want to know the whole story.

155
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,910
The world moves in a grand cycle of ten thousand years.

156
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,550
Plagues and wars

157
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,450
are common in the mortal realm.

158
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,270
This family's awash with money and food!

159
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,510
Everyone, if you don't want to starve,
join me in looting!

160
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,750
Yeah! Let's loot!

161
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,920
Come on, loot!

162
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,590
Open the door! Ram it!

163
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,030
-Harder!
-Open the door!

164
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,480
Mother, I'm so scared.

165
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,720
They're unbelievably rampant.

166
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,250
Master, I'll go fight them!

167
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,550
We're outnumbered.
Better not pick a fight.

168
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,670
Let them plunder as they wish.

169
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,400
Let's leave.

170
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,240
Okay.

171
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,670
Open the door!

172
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,800
Be careful, Master.

173
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:35,970
Master.

174
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,440
Let's go!

175
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,080
Master, you go first.

176
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,370
Let's go.

177
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,650
Stop there! Don't come any closer!

178
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,360
Stop!

179
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,240
What are you doing? Back off!

180
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
He's alone! Charge through! Ignore him!

181
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,720
Ignore him.

182
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,310
Go wait for me at the gate.

183
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,240
I'll go save him.

184
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,270
Go!

185
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,160
Go to hell!

186
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,069
Stop hitting!

187
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,880
Go away!

199
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,090
I'll go get you the med.

I'll go get him some meds.

211

212
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,590
Okay.

Shi'an, take this medicine,

221
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,240

Mother, I'm feeling terrible.

259
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,240
Mother, Uncle Changqin said you're a goddess from heaven.

260
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,720
You used to live in heaven, right?

261
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,480
Yes.

262
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Is it beautiful up there?

263
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,850
It's beautiful.

264
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,350
Up there in heaven,

265
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,440
it's the closest to the sun.

266
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,000
At sunrise,

267
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,680
the clouds are bathed in sunlight,

268
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,310
looking like clumps of golden malt sugar.

269
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,400
Mother, if immortals get really hungry,

270
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,030
do they eat the clouds in the sky?

271
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,170
No, they don't.

272
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:13,400
There are assorted delicious divine fruits in heaven,

273
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,350
and desserts too.

274
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,590
Besides, immortals have
spiritual energy to back them up.

275
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,850
They don't get hungry.

276
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,070
Then immortals don't get sick either, right?

277
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,720
Yeah, immortals don't get sick.

278
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,920
Mother, is father an immortal too?

279
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,440
He's the most powerful immortal
in the Nine Heavens.

280
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,440
Mother, if both you
and father are immortals,

281
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,400
why don't I have spiritual energy?

282
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,350
Why do I get sick?

283
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,750
Why can't I protect you?

284
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,200
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

285
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,110
When I was pregnant with you,

286
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,830
my power was sealed.

287
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,470
You couldn't absorb any spiritual energy.

288
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,160
So you're no different
from ordinary children.

289
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,160
But it's okay.

290
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,450
Just wait three more years.

291
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,640
In three years, I'll have my power back.

292
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,610
I'll take you back to the Nine Heavens.

293
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
You can enjoy divine fruits
and miraculous medicine.

294
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
I'll teach you
immortal power and techniques.

295
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,240
And just like me,

296
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,000
you won't get hungry, die,

297
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,830
or get sick anymore.

298
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,830
Everything sounds awesome
in the Nine Heavens.

299
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,510
Mother, please go back

300
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,400
to heaven after I die.

301
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,790
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

302
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,550

What about your child?

379
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,440
Died of the plague at the age of six.

380
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,040
So this is the grudge between you

381
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,680
and the reason you've been plotting
for hundreds of years

382
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,200
to kill him?

383
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,970
That's not the end of the story.

384
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,110
Do you know what's

385
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,240
the greatest suffering in this world?

386
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,240
What is it?

387
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,330
It's immortality.

388
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,550
-It's her!
-Let's go.

389
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,590
She used her sorcery to hurt me that day!

390
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,780
She must be a jinx!

391
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,720
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill!

392
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Come on! Kill her!

393
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,550
Hit her! Kill her! Kill her!

394
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,000
-Jinx!
-Jinx!

395
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,400
Kill her!

396
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,510
Jinx!

397
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,710
-Go to hell!
-Go!

398
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,230
Go to hell!

399
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,480
Let's go!

400
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,510
-Hit her!
-Go to hell!

401
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,440
-Kill her!
-You jinx!

402
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,190
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

403
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,400
Why won't she die?

404
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,760
Go to hell!

405
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,360
Go away if you don't want to die!

406
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,360
Get lost!

407
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,360
Master, let's go!

408
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,940
Come on.

409
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,800
Go away! Get lost!

410
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:31,480
[Here Rests My Beloved Son, Shi'an]

411
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,800
Master,

412
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,240
the refugees here all see you
as an evil witch.

413
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,880
We shouldn't stay here long.

414
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,840
Changqin!

415
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,110
Catch them!

416
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,510
Eliminate the evil witch!

417
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,230
-Kill the evil witch!
-Kill the evil witch!

418
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,000
Charge!

419
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,440
Kill the evil witch!

420
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,230
Changqin.

421
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,850
Get them!

422
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,550
Attack together!

423
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,730
Be careful!

424
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,250
Master!

425
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
Hit him! Hit him!

426
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,710
Go to hell!

427
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,630
Master!

428
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,040
Evil witch! Evil witch!

429
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,960
Damn you!

430
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,400
Evil witch!

431
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,510
Kill them!

432
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,670
Go to hell!

433
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,070
Kill him! Hit him!

434
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,900
Go to hell, you evil thing!

435
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,110
Changqin.

436
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,220
This person can use sorcery! Run!

437
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,760
Hurry! Run!

438
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,920
Run!

439
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,920
Changqin.

440
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,830
Changqin.

441
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,030
Changqin, get up.

442
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,790
Let's go see a doctor.

443
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,630
Didn't you say that

444
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,760
you were curious about
what the Nine Heavens looked like?

445
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
When you recover,

446
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,280
I'll take you there and show you around.

447
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,510
You're so bad at lying.

448
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,930
If I'm going to die, so be it.

449
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,070
I, Meng Changqin,
once cursed corrupt officials,

450
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,930
spent time behind bars,
and slain a Drought Dragon.

451
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,620
My life's been more thrilling than most.

452
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,380
But what about you?

453
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,260
How much longer will it take you
to recover your power?

454
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,400
Don't worry about me.

455
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,440
Come on, let's go.

456
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,600
Changqin!

457
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,000
Changqin.

458
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,400
Master.

459
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,000
Master.

460
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,870
I can't see anything.

461
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,800
It's a bit cold.

462
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,530
So this is what dying

463
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,030
feels like.

464
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,800
Sorry.

465
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,760
I'm sorry.

466
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:54,760
You are the best god in the w-world.

467
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Though I haven't seen other gods.

468
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,800
You saved
tens of thousands of people from torment,

469
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,510
sparing them
from the suffering of drought.

470
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,360
You are the greatest god.

471
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,370
[Here Rests My Beloved Son, Shi'an]

472
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,110
Changqin.

473
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,600
When I was young,

474
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
the teacher told me

475
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,670
not to go against the tide,

476
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,840
or I'd end up
bringing disaster upon myself.

477
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,410
But I didn't believe in that nonsense.

478
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,320
In a world like this,

479
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,070
if nobody stands up to fight for justice,

480
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,400
how messed up would it be?

481
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,930
You did nothing wrong.

482
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,760
Your only mistake

483
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,480
was encountering me.

484
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
Take a break.
Don't waste your energy talking.

485
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,550
How are you supposed to survive alone

486
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,770
in these chaotic times?

487
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,670
I wish I could hold on

488
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,630
just a bit longer.

489
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,110
Meng Changqin.

490
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,190
Changqin.

491
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,670
Changqin.

492
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,190
Meng Changqin!
