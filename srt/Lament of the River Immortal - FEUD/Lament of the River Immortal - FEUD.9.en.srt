00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,950
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,410
Don't come any closer!

4
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,170
Let me help you.

5
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,490
Don't come near me!

6
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,710
Don't come!

7
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,250
Wait.

8
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,810
What are you doing?

9
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,360
I've consumed countless spirit herbs.

10
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,310
My blood might be effective.

11
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,220
Heavenly Lord,

12
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,079
I have a question.

13
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,079
What is it?

14
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,720
If this place

15
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,010
is just an illusion created by Honglian,

16
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,630
then why did she put so many

17
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,960
ice petals containing her memories here?

18
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,860
Do you think what we just saw

19
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,840
was real or fake?

20
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,880
We can only ask Li Mo about that.

21
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,840
I feel it's real.

22
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,590
You also know

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,470
that Honglian's feelings
for Immortal Lord Li Mo

24
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,070
are now a mix of love and hate.

25
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,190
But in the memories we just saw,

26
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,040
Immortal Lord Li Mo
wasn't portrayed negatively.

27
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,310
I don't think Honglian has a reason

28
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,370
to create fake memories for us to see.

29
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,240
Also, you mentioned before

30
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,120
that Honglian was sealed for centuries.

31
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Her spiritual energy is
much weaker than before.

32
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Creating an illusion that could trap you

33
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,520
certainly wouldn't be an easy task for her.

34
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
So I have an idea.

35
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,830
You want to...

36
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,290
Destroy everything here.

37
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,440
Stand behind me.

38
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
Is that her true form?

39
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,170
Yes.

40
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,040
I guessed correctly.

41
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,370
Those illusions are indeed her true form.

42
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,230
Little girl, I really underestimated you.

43
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,480
Heavenly Lord, quickly capture her!

44
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,540
Honglian, return to Hell Ruins with me

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
and I'll spare your life.

46
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,000
Heavenly Lord!

47
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,120
Heavenly Lord!

48
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,960
Help!

49
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,040
Help!

50
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
Help!

51
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,800
Help! Help!

52
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,560
What's wrong?

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
He's come back to life!

54
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,410
My husband...

55
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,210
My husband has come back to life!

56
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,040
Don't be afraid. Take me to see him.

57
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,600
Let's go.

58
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,800
Don't waste your energy anymore.

59
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,090
Yun, exorcise the evil.

60
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,800
Release.

61
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,140
This isn't a resurrected corpse.

62
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,250
It's just the most basic form of puppetry.

63
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,400
I've already removed the control.

64
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,730
Everything is fine now.

65
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,240
Could you please help me tie him up?

66
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,610
I'm afraid it might happen again.

67
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,550
Alright, go find some rope.

68
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,440
Bai Jiusi.

69
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,730
Your spiritual energy

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,600
has decreased significantly
compared to before.

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,860
It seems that forcing you to come
out of seclusion this time

72
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,560
has caused you severe internal injuries.

73
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,270
Do you know what's the biggest weakness

74
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,160
you immortals have?

75
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
It's that you trust humans too much.

76
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,350
You should know that sometimes,
the human heart is scarier

77
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,190
than demons.

78
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,200
This is the binding method
taught by my sect.

79
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Even if he's controlled by someone
again in the future,

80
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,620
he won't be able to break free.

81
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,200
Thank you, miss.

82
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,380
I have other matters to attend to,
so I'll take my leave.

83
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,920
In the illusion, I saw you

84
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,290
place the Twin Heart Seal on Li Qingyue.

85
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,210
If I remember correctly,

86
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,210
besides sensing location,

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,530
if the person under the seal
gets injured,

88
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,060
the one who drew the seal
also bears half the injury.

89
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,270
If Li Qingyue dies,

90
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,080
will you lose half of your lifespan?

91
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,830
Trying to run?

92
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Not so fast!

93
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,670
It's you.

94
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,790
Why did you...

95
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,400
Why did you come to investigate?

96
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,410
What?

97
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,910
That bastard Xu Ying died. So what?

98
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,810
Why did you come to investigate?

99
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,200
You killed Xu Ying?

100
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,510
He deserved to die!

101
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,150
Beautiful lady, where are you going?

102
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,810
Husband, where are you going?

103
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,180
It's you again.

104
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,050
It's none of your business!

105
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,390
You're so annoying! Leave me alone.

106
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,120
Get lost!

107
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,120
You're drunk.

108
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,480
You're drunk. Let's go home.

109
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,410
I'm telling you!

110
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,550
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

111
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,840
You're either crying and whining

112
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,100
or you're nagging and complaining to me.

113
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,630
If you say another word, I'll get angry.

114
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,520
If you try to stop me, I'll hit you again.

115
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,840
Husband!

116
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,080
Beautiful lady.

117
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,150
Husband!

118
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,480
Beautiful lady.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
Beautiful lady.

120
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,480
Beautiful lady.

121
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,960
Beautiful lady.

122
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,790
Beautiful lady.

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,360
Beautiful lady.

124
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,240
You—

125
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
That's right.

126
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,440
Beautiful lady.

127
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,440
-Beauty.
-That’s me too.

128
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,080
I've come for you.

129
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,150
Dear,

130
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,360
I'm not the one you should be afraid of.

131
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,200
Is it worth it for a man like him?

132
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,270
Do you really want to

133
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,030
continue living like this?

134
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,480
Beautiful lady,

135
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,200
where are you?

136
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,750
Beautiful lady?

137
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,390
Where are you?

138
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,430
I was just thinking,

139
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,750
why would a person change?

140
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,140
We grew up together since childhood.

141
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,390
Why did he become so unfamiliar?

142
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,840
I just wanted to see
if he still had a heart.

143
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,390
He clearly had a heart.

144
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,150
Why would he do such heartless things?

145
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,870
So before we arrived,

146
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,240
you had already conspired with Honglian.

147
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,830
Conspired?

148
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,910
She was helping me.

149
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,390
Unlike you two.

150
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,200
You don't distinguish right from wrong
and just talk about hunting demons.

151
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,640
Why don't you deal with those who do evil?

152
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,150
You only target pitiful people like us.

153
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
We do distinguish right from wrong.

154
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,720
We just didn't know

155
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
about your husband's character before.

156
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,080
You did nothing wrong.
He did deserve to die.

157
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,140
Don't give me that.

158
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,120
I don't believe in cultivators like you

159
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,240
who change your tune

160
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,170
when talking to different people.

161
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,030
Honglian did me such a big favor.

162
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,920
Now it's time for me to help her.

163
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,240
Bai Jiusi, let's see how you
can defeat me.

164
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,310
You're really hard to kill, aren't you?

165
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,800
You still won't die?

166
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,440
If your throat is cut,

167
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,820
can you still live?

168
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,270
This is a pill to stop bleeding
and heal wounds.

169
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,200
Take it quickly.

170
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,060
Master will surely blame me this time.

171
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,150
The person who hurt me
is in league with Honglian.

172
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,000
The Heavenly Lord has already
gone after Honglian.

173
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,570
He might be in danger now.

174
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,250
We need to find him quickly.

175
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,109
Li Mo,

176
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,579
you've finally come to see me.

177
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,930
Heavenly Lord!

178
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,740
Are you alright?

179
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,130
Immortal Lord Li Mo!

180
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,750
Go.

181
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,250
You can't leave!

182
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,030
You actually hurt me?

183
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,510
This Sky-Reaching Ladder was made of
the essence of heaven and earth.

184
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,200
It harnesses the essence of heaven
and transforms the waters.

185
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,530
It connects heaven and earth,
transcending the six realms.

186
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,450
If you wish to achieve what others cannot,

187
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,500
you must endure suffering
that others cannot bear.

188
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,160
Fierce winds will temper your body;
raging fires will burn your flesh.

189
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,720
Can you withstand the pain

190
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,330
of tearing muscles and shattering bones?

191
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,310
Honglian is a great water demon.

192
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,160
Using fire to counter her
is an excellent method,

193
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,880
but your own essence is also of yin water.

194
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,140
Where did you get so much yang fire power?

195
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,030
Master, your old illness hasn't healed.

196
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,880
I didn't bring any miraculous medicine
this time.

197
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,210
Now that you've injured your foundation,

198
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,800
you won't heal
without a few months of rest.

199
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,960
This...

200
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,400
How can you be so weak?

201
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,160
Didn't you obtain the Blazing Fire magic
from the Siling long ago?

202
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,020
How could it suddenly disappear?

203
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,890
It wouldn't vanish into thin air.

204
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,200
Power waxes and wanes.

205
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,590
If it's not with me,

206
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,930
it must be hidden somewhere else.

207
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,410
Master, you still suspect...

208
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,760
Heavenly Lord, you're better now?

209
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,610
Have something to eat.

210
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,810
The Heavenly Lord doesn't need to eat.

211
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,010
Immortal Lord Li Mo,
would you like to eat something too?

212
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,070
No need.

213
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,270
What should we do next?

214
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,210
Are we going to catch Honglian?

215
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,350
Time is too tight.

216
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,790
I've only treated Master's
external injuries.

217
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,920
His internal injuries are severe now.

218
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,430
He needs time to recover.

219
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,750
It's not advisable to
confront Honglian again.

220
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,480
But we still have you, don't we?

221
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,290
I'm no match for Honglian.

222
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,750
But you just sent her flying

223
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,150
with one palm strike now.

224
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,560
Then let's go back to Canglei Palace
for reinforcements.

225
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,150
We can't leave.

226
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,090
What do you mean?

227
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,160
My spiritual energy is damaged
and greatly diminished.

228
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,110
And this Honglian

229
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,570
has been hiding
her true strength all along.

230
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,260
She just altered the barrier
formation I set up.

231
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,650
Now, the ones who can't leave this place

232
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,880
have become us.

233
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,110
It's alright.

234
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,610
Judging by the time,

235
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,790
Long Yuan should be back from
reporting to Empyrean by now.

236
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,050
He will surely come here when he returns.

237
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,800
So before that, we can only
hide from Honglian?

238
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,010
That's all we can do.

239
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,140
We have no chance of winning
in a direct confrontation.

240
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,200
Honglian has been looking for you.

241
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,830
I'm afraid she won't
let us hide like this.

242
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:43,630
[Songhe County]

243
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,200
Immortal Lord Li Mo.

244
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,160
The Heavenly Lord and I saw your past

245
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,220
in the illusion created by Honglian.

246
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,750
In her memories,

247
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,790
weren't you two quite close?

248
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,440
How did it come to this?

249
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,030
The Heavenly Lord didn't ask before
out of respect for your choice,

250
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,490
but we can't avoid
talking about it anymore.

251
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,550
You might as well tell us.

252
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,200
Maybe I...

253
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,640
And the Heavenly Lord can help.

254
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,730
How much do you know?

255
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,720
I know that in the past, you wanted to
help Honglian dispel her evil energy.

256
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,450
You even fed her your own blood.

257
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,400
By all rights, she should be
very grateful to you.

258
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,940
Why do you still need to hide from her?

259
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,530
I hide from her because
I don't want her obsession to deepen.

260
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,590
Obsession?

261
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,830
Honglian used to hurt people
for the blood of their hearts.

262
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,490
It was only to
dispel the evil energy in her body.

263
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,110
After I met her,

264
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,880
I kept her by my side for decades.

265
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,110
At first, I just wanted to
find a way to cure her.

266
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,760
I never thought that in the end,

267
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,960
I would cause her to develop
another illness.

268
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,830
What illness?

269
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
The illness of jealousy.

270
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,240
Li Mo.

271
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,220
What... what are you doing?

272
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,480
Why are you holding her?

273
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,680
I'm giving her medicine.

274
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,270
Didn't you say you were going
to cure my illness?

275
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,480
Why are you taking care of them now?

276
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,200
I will find a way to cure your illness.

277
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,330
I won't neglect you.

278
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,270
Aren't you neglecting me right now?

279
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,040
You're the same as them.

280
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,080
I will treat everyone equally.

281
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,110
You're using your blood to save others?

282
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,240
Don't make it known.

283
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,160
If others find out,

284
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,540
they might mistake me for a demon.

285
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,760
It's fine. It'll heal after I
apply some medicine.

286
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,300
So this is how you treat everyone.

287
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,680
What?

288
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,570
What are you doing?

289
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,350
Li Mo.

290
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Can't you see that I like you?

291
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,310
You don't need to use such tactics on me.

292
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,170
My heart's blood cannot save you.

293
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,010
Since I promised you

294
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,240
to find another way to
dispel your evil energy,

295
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,040
I will do it.

296
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,720
You don't believe that I love you?

297
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,880
Whether I believe it or not
is meaningless.

298
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,810
I've said before

299
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,030
that I only care about saving people.

300
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,490
I have no interest in love.

301
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,790
Stop it.

302
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,650
If that's the case,

303
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,780
then I'm the only one you can save.

304
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,570
As a cultivator,

305
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,690
how can I only save one person?

306
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,350
If you continue to act recklessly,
you'll disturb my cultivation.

307
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,080
Then I won't be able to
keep you by my side anymore.

308
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,000
Come.

309
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,200
What have you done?

310
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,510
If you want to save someone,
you can only save me.

311
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,830
Your blood can only be given to me.

312
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,120
What have you done?

313
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,920
I am a flower that grew by
the Naihe Bridge.

314
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,250
I carry evil energy.

315
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,070
Your blood can save people,

316
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,480
while my blood can kill people.

317
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,550
Don't you think we're a perfect match?

318
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,500
Why did you

319
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,540
take their lives?

320
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,180
Only by making you kill them
with your own hands,

321
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,820
ending their lives,

322
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,200
will you

323
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,550
stop saving others in the future.

324
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,000
I told you,

325
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,680
you can only save me.

326
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,000
Now it's all good.

327
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,720
You don't have to be troubled anymore.

328
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,170
From now on, I'm the only one
who needs your salvation.

329
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,610
What happened then?

330
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,620
After that,

331
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,000
I couldn't bear the fact
that I had unintentionally killed people.

332
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,980
I didn't want to see Honglian ever again.

333
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,110
So you started avoiding her?

334
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,080
I practice the way of medicine.

335
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,530
I can only save people.

336
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,680
I can't kill her.

337
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,680
Were you the one who
approached the Heavenly Lord

338
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,940
to help seal Honglian?

339
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,270
No.

340
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,680
It just so happened that Master and...

341
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,480
Divine Lord Siling.

342
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,000
Yes.

343
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,590
They happened to travel to the village.

344
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,310
They worked together to seal Honglian.

345
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,840
Because of this,
I became Master's disciple.

346
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,990
But I felt guilty inside.

347
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
She insists on seeing you every day.

348
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,750
Are you really not going to
see her even once?

349
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,000
My sins are heavy.

350
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,310
Now, I only wish to travel
in the mortal realm

351
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,310
and do good deeds

352
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,550
to atone for the sins I've committed.

353
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,930
What about her?

354
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,930
Are you just going to abandon her?

355
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,280
I overestimated myself.

356
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,160
I once foolishly thought I could save her.

357
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,470
That's what led to such a grave mistake.

358
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,580
Now that she has been sealed,

359
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,460
I trouble you, Master, to watch over her.

360
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,500
She is a tribulation in your destiny.

361
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,160
You can't escape it no matter how you try.

362
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,860
I have no desire to
face this tribulation again.

363
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,030
I beg for your understanding.

364
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,240
Did you really
never have feelings for Honglian?

365
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,680
Never.

366
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,240
Have you ever had feelings for anyone?

367
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,510
No.

368
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,590
No wonder.

369
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,160
Of course you can't understand

370
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,400
the stubbornness of someone who's
just tasted love for the first time.

371
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,480
It's not jealousy.

372
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,350
It's possessiveness born out of love.

373
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,600
I've seen how Honglian acts
around other men.

374
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,550
It's all an act.

375
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,920
She only treats you differently.

376
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,980
I suppose it's her first time
learning to love someone.

377
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,970
What do you mean by that?

378
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,160
I'm just thinking out loud.

379
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,110
Honglian's actions were
indeed gravely wrong,

380
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,190
but she's a demon.

381
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,510
As you said,

382
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,720
she's been tormented
by evil energy since birth.

383
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,000
She's protecting herself.

384
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,370
No one taught her to distinguish
between right and wrong.

385
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,830
But if you had calmly explained

386
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,460
everything to her from the very beginning,

387
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
guiding her to let go of her grievances,

388
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,520
wouldn't that have prevented
the later disaster?

389
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,070
Of course, you have no
romantic feelings for Honglian.

390
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,730
That's not your fault either.

391
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,110
It's just that you've been
avoiding her ever since,

392
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,910
allowing her to become crazier.

393
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,270
That's a bit inappropriate.

394
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,140
I didn't expect you to be so well-versed
in matters of love.

395
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,240
When it comes to love, I'm an expert.

396
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,740
I wholeheartedly love
the Heavenly Lord, you know.

397
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,110
Master is just circulating
his energy to heal.

398
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,150
He can hear our conversation.

399
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,420
I know.

400
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,140
I'm saying this on purpose
for him to hear.

401
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,050
Immortal Lord Li Mo,

402
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,200
why do I feel that the Heavenly Lord's
spiritual energy

403
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,440
is a bit chaotic?

404
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,390
Has his condition worsened?

405
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,139
But getting back to the point,

406
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,670
I always felt that you loved her.

407
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,190
-Never.
-Don’t deny it.

408
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,280
There are countless forms
of love in this world.

409
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,880
It's not just romantic love.

410
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,719
What's wrong?

411
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,690
Be careful.

412
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,580
This is...

413
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,900
Honglian's water spiritual energy.

414
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,699
Has she discovered us?

415
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,740
No.

416
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,130
But she's forcing us to reveal ourselves.

417
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,920
Forcing us?

418
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,000
Is she trying to...

419
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Freeze the whole Songhe County.

420
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,830
What about the people inside?

421
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,550
[Songhe County]

422
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,150
We can't wait for Long Yuan anymore.

423
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,350
If we wait any longer,

424
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,960
all the people in Songhe County
will suffer.

425
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,420
My Lady was right earlier.

426
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,000
It was my constant avoidance

427
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,800
that led Honglian
to make mistake after mistake.

428
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,860
It's time to go and
resolve this conflict with her.

429
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,110
We'll go with you.

430
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,920
You don't understand love.

431
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,110
I'm afraid you might
say the wrong thing again

432
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,370
and make things worse.

433
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,210
Let's go together.

434
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,400
This shield will protect you
from the ice.

435
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,290
There's no time to waste. Let's go.

436
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,030
Honglian.

437
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,070
Stop this.

438
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,410
After all these years,

439
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,480
you still can't change your bad habit
of wanting to save people.

440
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,230
You wanted to see me, and I'm here now.

441
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,120
Don't harm the people of Songhe County.

442
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,320
I did want to see you.

443
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,360
But during the centuries I've been sealed,

444
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,720
why didn't you come to see me even once?

445
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,490
Are you still resenting me

446
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,620
for making you kill?

447
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,710
In that case,

448
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,760
why don't I make you bear
the burden of more deaths,

449
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,820
so you won't dare to avoid me anymore?

450
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,510
No!

451
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,810
Master, you can't recklessly use
your spiritual energy anymore.

452
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,930
I'll help the Heavenly Lord.

453
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,060
Speak more gently.

454
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,850
Quickly resolve those
old grudges between you.

455
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,690
Go quickly.

456
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,740
This time, I won't run away
from you anymore.

457
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,850
Don't make the same mistake again.

458
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,840
I'll accompany you to atone for

459
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,330
the sins you committed in the past.

460
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,760
Sins?

461
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
I never thought those were sins.

462
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,230
You were the one volunteered

463
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,440
to help me dispel the evil energy
in my body.

464
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,360
It was also you

465
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,600
who abandoned me

466
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,230
to save others.

467
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,620
You're the one who's sinned all along.

468
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,440
I never intended to abandon you.

469
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,100
But you clearly did just that.

470
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,230
For hundreds of years,

471
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,710
I've been tormented by evil energy.

472
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,710
I've never trusted anyone,

473
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,630
except you.

474
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,900
But what about you?

475
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,510
In the end, you were only thinking
about how to get rid of me.

476
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,280
I didn't.

477
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,710
You said you studied the way of medicine,

478
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,890
that you were born to help others,

479
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
but you couldn't even save me.

480
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,520
How can you save anyone else?

481
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
How are you any different

482
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,860
from those men who abandon women?

483
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,560
Immortal Lord Li Mo, the Heavenly Lord
can't hold on much longer.

484
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,180
Right or wrong, there's no point
in arguing further.

485
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,700
Honglian, if you just stop,

486
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:49,930
I promise you

487
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,490
that before I dispel the evil energy
in your body,

488
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,090
I won't interfere in
others' affairs anymore.

489
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,000
This time, I'll keep my word.

490
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,240
Then do you love me?

491
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,830
Immortal Lord Li Mo,
just say you love her.

492
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,130
What difference would it make anyway?

493
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,800
I...

494
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,810
There's no need.

495
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,050
I don't need those words anymore.

496
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,450
Honglian.

497
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,250
Honglian, what are you going to do?

498
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,220
Heavenly Lord!

499
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,180
Heavenly Lord!

500
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,880
Honglian, that's enough.

501
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,360
Heavenly Lord!

502
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,960
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

503
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,820
Rise.

504
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,570
Heavenly Lord!

505
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,540
Yue.

506
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,510
It's you.
