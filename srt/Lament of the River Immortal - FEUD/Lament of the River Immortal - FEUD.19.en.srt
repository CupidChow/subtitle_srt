[Episode 19]

3
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,950
[Peace]

4
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,710
You're awake.

5
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,030
I wanted to take a nap,

6
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,760
but I didn't expect to sleep so deeply.

7
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,320
How are you feeling?

8
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,820
Do you still feel weak and light-headed?

9
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,580
Much better.

10
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,850
That's good.

11
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,079
Our magic has been sealed.

12
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,400
Forcibly using it

13
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,630
will cause the two types
of spiritual energy to clash in your body.

14
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,160
You know the consequences.

15
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,100
Why did you still do it?

16
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,870
Today in the alley,

17
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,640
I encountered the evil spirit.

18
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Its true form is a mass of black mist.

19
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,880
It hasn't transformed into human form.

20
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,720
In the alley, it wanted to attack Tao.

21
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,770
In that life-or-death moment,
I had no time to think.

22
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,640
So the evil spirit rumor is true?

23
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,470
But I haven't figured out the origin

24
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,710
of the evil spirit.

25
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,470
And I don't know why it's here.

26
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,630
In that case, you should rest well
for the next few days.

27
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,960
I'll investigate the evil spirit matter.

28
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,480
The evil spirit is vicious,
and its magic is unpredictable.

29
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,870
Besides, it's in the shadows
while we stand in the light.

30
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,950
Be careful.

31
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,830
Don't worry. I know what to do.

32
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,000
Rest well. I'm leaving.

33
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,510
Thank you.

34
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,330
Thank you for taking care of me.

35
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,480
We're both here,
and our lives are tied as one.

36
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm not just doing this for you.

37
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,420
I'm doing this for myself as well.

38
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,660
Zhang Suan.

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,660
Zhang Suan.

40
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,750
Do you think Divine Lord
would come to a place like this?

41
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,550
There's not even a place to rest.

42
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
You...

43
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,630
It's so dark here.

44
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,480
What can you possibly find?

45
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,650
I didn't force you to come.

46
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,950
If you're unwilling,

47
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,430
you can leave.

48
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,970
That line again?

49
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,870
At the rate you're going,

50
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,870
who knows when we can find anything?

51
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,310
Let me help you.

52
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,630
This place is unusually strange.

53
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,360
Be careful.

54
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,130
Are you worried about me?

55
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,180
Stop!

56
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,170
Come in.

57
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,770
Dinner is ready.

58
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,800
Thank you.

59
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,220
How are your injuries?

60
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Nothing serious.

61
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,450
Still acting tough.

62
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,840
Forcibly using magic

63
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,270
can cause two streams
of spiritual energy to clash in your body.

64
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,330
That pain is no less

65
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,800
than having your heart gouged out.

66
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,300
And you say it's nothing serious?

67
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,840
You seem to know it well.

68
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,800
Have you forgotten?

69
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,000
My magic was sealed before.

70
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
Of course I have experience.

71
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,970
I'm done eating.

72
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,510
We've been set up.

73
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,770
Show yourself.

74
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,530
Hiding like a coward—
what kind of skill is that?

75
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,080
Are you alright?

76
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,330
Don't let him escape.

77
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,240
Who?

78
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,510
That evil spirit.

79
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,670
Keep running.

80
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,600
Let's see who's faster—

81
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,390
you or my sword.

82
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,500
[Songhe County]

83
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,030
These days,

84
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,700
I've searched
every corner of Songhe County,

85
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,760
but found no trace of the evil spirit.

86
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,200
So I'm thinking

87
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,510
maybe it's not in the county,

88
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,240
but somewhere outside.

89
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,460
Did you find anything in the outskirts?

90
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,400
No,

91
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,820
because I can't even leave Songhe County.

92
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,430
Candied haws. Want some?

93
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,840
Speak plainly.

94
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm not an evil spirit!

95
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
Watch your attitude.

96
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,210
Say it again.

97
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,380
I'm not an evil spirit.

98
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,690
Disgusting.

99
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,150
Enough.

100
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
I have questions for him.

101
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,120
Have you seen two immortals
fall into this place?

102
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
A man and a woman, both dressed in white.

103
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,290
Never seen them.

104
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,930
If you won't tell me the truth,

105
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll toss you into the alchemy furnace

106
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,460
and refine you into a pill.

107
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,120
I've only been here for seven days.

108
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,730
I've never seen any immortals.

109
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,080
Liar.

110
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,200
You saw their powerful spiritual energy,

111
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,840
so you decided to hide them away,

112
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,770
planning to secretly refine them.

113
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,390
Am I right?

114
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,630
No matter what,

115
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,240
I'm a spirit
who has cultivated for centuries.

116
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm practically
half a step into immortality.

117
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,240
I've indeed played some tricks,

118
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,600
but refining immortals is pure evil.

119
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,060
I'd never do that.

120
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,000
You think you haven't done enough

121
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,870
vile things?

122
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,890
What do you mean?

123
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,790
Before I came, I heard

124
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,550
Songhe County is so desolate and ruined

125
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,490
because of an evil spirit.

126
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,600
The evil spirit they mentioned isn't me.

127
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
First, someone in Songhe County
had his heart dug out.

128
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,360
Then the county was frosted for no reason.

129
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,870
That's what scared everyone away.

130
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,510
Is that true?

131
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,390
Of course.

132
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,960
If you don't believe me,

133
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
you can check my core.

134
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,090
You're also a cultivator.

135
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,270
You know

136
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,240
if a core is tainted with blood,

137
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,870
it will be shrouded in a bloody aura.

138
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,470
What he said is true.

139
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,680
The evil spirit in Songhe County

140
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,720
is not him.

141
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,910
I told you it's not me!

142
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,080
Release me now!

143
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,960
I didn't aim properly.

144
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,390
This place is so desolate and ruined.

145
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,720
What are you doing here?

146
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,520
I'm here for the Peach Blossom Garden.

147
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,090
The Peach Blossom Garden?

148
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,270
A place of bliss beyond the world.

149
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,440
I heard that those who accidentally
entered the Peach Blossom Garden here

150
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
reached the place they desired most

151
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,360
and saw the person they longed for most.

152
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Have you found it?

153
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,000
Not yet.

154
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,840
But I will someday.

155
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,840
You believe something so mystical?

156
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,730
Maybe someone tricked you.

157
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,160
Of course it's real.

158
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,440
Someone who came out told me

159
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,050
it's a paradise inside

160
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,380
and it has everything you could want.

161
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,580
The Peach Blossom Garden?

162
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,670
The barrier is exceptionally strong.

163
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,130
Our power has been sealed.

164
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,020
Even if we try our best,
we can't break it.

165
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,840
We might even end up hurting ourselves.

166
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,560
This seems to be
the ancient Dragon Imprisonment Formation.

167
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,220
It's a high-level formation.

168
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,110
Only those from the divine realm
can master it.

169
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,860
How could an evil spirit
have such ability?

170
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,480
If gods can do it, why can't humans?

171
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,750
Aren't we both gods?

172
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,450
Yet we're trapped in the mortal realm.

173
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,520
After all this talk,
do you have a way to break it?

174
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,930
Yes, but it's useless.

175
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,829
There are only two ways
to break this kind of barrier.

176
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,359
First, find the formation eye
and destroy it.

177
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,730
Second, kill the person
who set up the formation.

178
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,450
Given the current situation,

179
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,380
killing the evil spirit
is the quickest way.

180
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,240
But our power has been sealed.

181
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm afraid we're no match for it.

182
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,040
We should still try our best.

183
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,830
The evil spirit
has been slaughtering civilians.

184
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,560
The dead's resentful energy
and the alive's fear

185
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,280
will only make it stronger.

186
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,260
If we delay any longer,

187
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,130
I'm afraid things will get worse.

188
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,350
But it hides in the dark,
and we're exposed. Our chances are slim.

189
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,700
Victory in battle often depends
not on strength,

190
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,960
but on strategy.

191
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,970
Ancient formations come in three levels.

192
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,060
Third-level formations
draw on nature's spirits.

193
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,410
Mountains are yang, and water is yin.

194
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,080
This is called the Earth Way.

195
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,640
Second-level formations
rely on the light of the stars.

196
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
Celestial stems are yang,
and earthly branches are yin.

197
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,860
This is called the Heaven Way.

198
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,650
While first-level formations
require the power of living beings.

199
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,320
Humans are the spirit
of all living things,

200
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,400
representing the purest yin, yang,
kindness, and innocence.

201
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
This is called the Human Way.

202
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,280
The harmony of Heaven, Earth, and Human
is the supreme formation.

203
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,550
You seem pretty comfortable
living like a mortal.

204
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,640
Before sealing your magic,
you prepared not only money,

205
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,570
but also so many spiritual stones.

206
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,930
Bai Jiusi, are you that afraid of death?

207
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,360
I've always been thorough.

208
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,990
You keep saying
I don't understand mortals,

209
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,130
but look,

210
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,500
I understand them better than anyone.

211
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,150
That's just what you think.

212
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,910
When the ten-year pact ends,

213
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
you'll know

214
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,310
how ridiculous that sounds.

215
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,620
You let the monkey spirit go.

216
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
Where do you plan to look for her now?

217
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,330
I'm not going anywhere.

218
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,840
I'll stay right here.

219
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,590
Here?

220
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,060
Songhe County is so desolate now.

221
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,750
If you cough,
people within 3.3 miles could hear it.

222
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,950
Where could anyone possibly be hiding?

223
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,490
Just because you can't see it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

224
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,930
Maybe the Peach Blossom Garden does exist.

225
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,970
It really can trap people
in another time and space.

226
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,410
You're also a cultivator.

227
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,550
Do you really believe there is

228
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,550
such a mystical place in this world?

229
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,410
I once read
about a magical artifact in a book.

230
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,250
It's something with effects
similar to the Peach Blossom Garden.

231
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,570
What magical artifact? Tell me about it.

232
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,750
It's an ancient divine artifact
called the Great Wilderness Stele.

233
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,680
It was once refined by an immortal.

234
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,350
The stele has the power to capture souls
and confine primordial spirits.

235
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,440
Those who enter it are as if
entering an illusion or a barrier.

236
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,500
The difference is—

237
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,960
the illusion is created by the caster.

238
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,750
With a single thought,
he can conjure endless realities.

239
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,540
It can place someone in a land of bliss

240
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,480
or trap them in an abyss of torment.

241
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,600
According to what you said,

242
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,310
the Great Wilderness Stele
doesn't sound like a divine artifact.

243
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,240
It sounds more like an evil object.

244
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,240
Swords can hurt people,

245
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,690
but they can also protect them.

246
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,080
Whether a magical artifact is good or evil

247
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,960
depends entirely on the one who wields it.

248
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,500
Then this magical artifact—whose is it?

249
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,040
I've lived for centuries
and never heard of it.

250
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,070
Did you make it up?

251
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,280
The book
didn't mention the immortal's name.

252
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,010
Back when I was in the sect,

253
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,680
there were a few years when my foundation
was completely destroyed.

254
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,830
So I spent

255
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,090
almost all of those years in the library.

256
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,590
I read every book in there.

257
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,650
That's how I came to know
about these rare artifacts.

258
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,070
The library of Jingyun Sect?

259
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
Then it might be true.

260
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,550
If that's really the case,

261
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,110
this is far beyond what you can handle.

262
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,040
You'd better return to your sect
while you still can.

263
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,290
Are you here to help me find her or not?

264
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,080
All you do is saying discouraging things.

265
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,850
I really don't see
how worried you are about Qingyue.

266
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,440
I've known Divine Lord Siling

267
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,570
far longer than you.

268
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,420
Of course I'm not like you,

269
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,110
fretting over everything blindly.

270
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,110
Mrs. Lin.

271
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,790
Your dishes.

272
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,920
I heard your son
encountered an evil spirit a few days ago.

273
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,680
Is it true?

274
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,240
What evil spirit?

275
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,790
It's nonsense. Don't spread rumors.

276
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,460
I'm not spreading rumors.

277
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,110
I really did hear something.

278
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,720
The bamboo scaffolds in the alley
suddenly collapsed.

279
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,380
They nearly crushed your son.

280
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,830
Those bamboo scaffolds
had been there for a long time.

281
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,430
They were already unstable.

282
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,240
That can't be.

283
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,510
I passed by a few days ago.

284
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,710
I saw people climbing on them every day.

285
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,720
They were very sturdy.

286
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,830
Now they suddenly collapsed.

287
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,960
It must be the work of that evil spirit.

288
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,350
Mrs. Lin, don't worry.

289
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,720
I don't mean anything else.

290
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,480
I just want to ask
if there's a way to escape.

291
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,880
Just in case.

292
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,070
I...

293
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,440
Uncle Bai!

294
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,310
Uncle Bai, please take me as your disciple

295
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,370
and teach me magic.

296
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,440
I told you.

297
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,440
Get up.

298
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,830
The child doesn't know any better.
Please don't take it to heart, Mr. Bai.

299
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,360
Let's go.

300
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,160
Uncle Bai!

301
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,090
-Uncle Bai!
-Let's go.

302
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,200
-Could Mr. Bai truly know magic?
-Uncle Bai!

303
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Uncle Bai!

304
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,270
-Let's eat.
-Uncle Bai!

305
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,480
Mr. Bai.

306
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,880
Mr. Bai.

307
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,880
I've been waiting here

308
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,790
because I want to ask you something.

309
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,590
Mr. Bai.

310
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,480
Are you really an immortal?

311
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,720
Mr. Bai,

312
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,640
you saved my Tao yesterday.

313
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,260
I haven't had the chance to thank you.

314
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,750
So let me thank you now.

315
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,440
No need to be polite.

316
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,510
Mr. Bai.

317
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,100
Since you have such power—

318
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,720
when that fire broke out six years ago,

319
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,310
you were clearly at home.

320
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,400
Why did you watch my husband

321
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,440
die in the flames?

322
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,570
He regarded you as his dearest friend.

323
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,450
Since you...

324
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,900
Since you could save Tao,

325
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,790
why couldn't you save him?

326
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,270
I know whether to save someone or not
is your choice.

327
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,440
I shouldn't ask you or blame you.

328
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,440
But...

329
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,030
I just feel that my husband...

330
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,240
my husband was too foolish.

331
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,070
Mr. Bai.

333
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,590
In the future,

334
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,120
please stay away from my Tao.

335
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Call it ungrateful if you like.

336
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,960
My husband's death wasn't your fault,

337
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,960
but every time I see you,

338
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,280
I think of how you let him die.

339
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,290
Let's draw a clear line between us now,

340
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,830
so that one day when Tao learns the truth,

341
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,120
he won't be heartbroken.

342
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,270
Ruyue.

343
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,810
Do you regret it?

344
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,240
Do you regret saving Lin Tao?

345
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,790
And do you regret not saving Lin Fan?

346
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,640
[Peace]

347
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,000
-Run!
-Run!

348
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,510
Make way! Everyone, make way!

349
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,680
Government business! Move aside!

350
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,500
What happened?

351
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,680
My Lord! My Lord!

352
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,120
My brother was taken by an evil spirit!

353
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,060
Please save him!

354
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,330
-Save him, My Lord!
-An evil spirit?

355
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,790
-My brother was taken by an evil spirit!
-An evil spirit?

356
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,350
Where?

357
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,880
[Prosperity and tranquility
for the people]

358
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,270
There's an evil spirit.

359
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,600
Everyone, out of my way!

360
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,240
There's an evil spirit.

361
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,680
Seal!

362
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,480
There's an evil spirit!

363
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:48,590
[Morgue]

364
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,890
You must be out of places to search.

365
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,680
You even came to a filthy place like this.

366
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,480
If you're scared, don't come in.

367
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,790
Scared?

368
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,730
I've never known what fear is
since my childhood!

369
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,880
Zhang Suan.

370
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,660
Zhang Suan?

371
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,970
[Morgue]

372
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,760
Who's there?

373
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,520
Why are you here?

374
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,610
-How did you get in?
-Where is Qingyue?

375
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,470
Where on earth is Qingyue?

376
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,470
Where's Qingyue?

377
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,650
I couldn't find you when I came in.

378
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,290
Why did you walk so fast?

379
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,030
Master, it's him!

380
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,750
He's the one who took my brother!

381
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,950
He is the evil spirit!

382
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,640
It's been a long time
since that rainy night.

383
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,100
How have you been, Mr. Bai?

384
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,110
If you have any real cultivation,

385
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,370
you should know the evil spirit has fled.

386
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,310
Fled? Fled where?

387
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,050
Isn't the evil spirit right before me?

388
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,640
You evil spirit, surrender!

389
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:04,800
Let's go!

390
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,560
Where do you think you can go?

391
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,480
You've paced back and forth a dozen times.

392
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,960
What exactly are you looking for?

393
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,190
I just saw Bai Jiusi.

394
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,000
Where is he?

395
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,070
He's here, yet not here.

396
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,160
What does that mean?

397
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,050
Perhaps I just entered...

398
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,330
the Peach Blossom Garden
that monkey spirit talked about.

399
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,110
Who are you?

400
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,710
Are you still alive?
If you are, say something.

401
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
How is Master?

402
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,360
His meridians are functioning normally,

403
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,450
but he remains unconscious.

404
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
It seems someone
has trapped his primordial spirit.

405
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,070
And the wound on his neck

406
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,680
can't be healed with magic.

407
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,590
It must be that his primordial spirit
has been injured.

408
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,000
We'd better summon Immortal Lord Li Mo

409
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
back to treat him.

410
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,600
I've already sent him a message.

411
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,840
Did you just say
his primordial spirit has left his body?

412
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,670
Yes. Only when
the primordial spirit returns to his body

413
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,530
will his body gradually recover.

414
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,070
That woman must have done something

415
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,840
to trap Master's primordial spirit.

416
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,280
I'm going to Jingyun Sect now

417
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,680
to bring that witch back!

418
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,800
Immortal Lord Li Mo will be back soon.

419
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,360
Why don't you wait for him?

420
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,290
There's no time!

421
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,250
You stay here and take care of Master!

422
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,840
Senior.

423
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,130
-Senior.
-Senior.

424
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,630
How is Master?

425
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,910
His life's not in danger for now.

426
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,320
-Not in danger.
-That's great.

427
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,190
You two stay in Canglei Palace.

428
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,840
Take good care of Master's body for me.

429
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,680
Where are you going?

430
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,030
Strike the drums!

431
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,760
Summon all disciples of Canglei Palace!

432
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,090
Follow me to Jingyun Sect
to take her back!

433
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,480
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

434
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,720
[Immortal Lord Fan is in danger.
Come back quickly. Zhu Li]

435
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,890
If you have something to do, leave.
I can handle things here alone.

436
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,480
No need.

437
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,550
Whether he lives or dies...
is not my concern.

438
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,400
[Peace]

439
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,280
Bai Jiusi.

440
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,720
You're awake.

441
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm fine.

442
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,320
That Xiaoyaozi truly has some skills.

443
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,530
He even managed to hurt you.

444
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,000
If my power hadn't been sealed,

445
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,960
I could have killed him with one strike.

446
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,640
Even with your power sealed,

447
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,310
you still have a divine body—

448
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,480
invulnerable and immortal.

449
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,320
The fact that he could hurt you

450
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,120
is enough to prove his strength.

451
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,630
Just petty tricks.

452
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,880
But the evil spirit does have some skills.

453
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,510
It used magic to bewitch people,

454
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,360
making the victims falsely accuse me.

455
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,880
Since you know
the evil spirit is powerful,

456
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,630
protect yourself first.

457
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,550
Using magic will cause excruciating pain.

458
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,460
If it happens a few more times,

459
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,270
I'm afraid your life might be in danger.

460
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,850
I saw Zhang Suan at the morgue.

461
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,530
Impossible.

462
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,030
Why?

463
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,550
Songhe County has been sealed
by the evil spirit.

464
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,880
No outsiders can enter.

465
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,240
You said you saw Zhang Suan.

466
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,630
Then where is he now?

467
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,890
He disappeared at the morgue.

468
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,800
Could it be the evil spirit in disguise,

469
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,860
trying to lure you?

470
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,930
It's possible.

471
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,960
Don't act alone again.

472
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,460
Are you hungry?
I'll cook you some porridge.

473
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,600
You've felt it too, haven't you?

474
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,320
What?

475
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,480
Here.

476
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,320
Excruciating pain.

477
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,860
You've felt it too, right?

478
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,030
I thought during your ten years
in the mortal realm,

479
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,710
as long as I gave you
enough money and servants,

480
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,160
you'd live peacefully without worry.

481
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,840
But I never imagined

482
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,890
in the mortal realm, there would be
so many unforeseen disasters.

483
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,760
During the ten years,

484
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,150
were there times you had to use your power

485
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,880
just to protect yourself?

486
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,510
In those moments,

487
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
was anyone there to take care of you?

488
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,240
I'll go make some porridge.

489
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,680
Catch them! Eliminate the demons!

490
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,630
I'm going to beat you to death!
