00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,009
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,690
Without love, where does hatred come from?

4
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,479
I don't want to hear you
talk about this nonsense.

5
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,039
Get out.

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,040
How about you listen to my story instead?

7
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,730
I once fell in love with a man.

8
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,370
He was also very nice to me.

9
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,050
Unfortunately, I was young
and didn't understand love.

10
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,850
I... was always trying to hurt him

11
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,960
just to test his feelings for me.

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
I left him battered and bruised.

13
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,870
In the end, he chose to leave.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,630
Actually, he loved me very much,
and I loved him too.

15
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,970
It was when I finally realized this

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,720
that I went to find him again,

17
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,800
only to find he had already passed away.

18
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
In heaven and on earth,

19
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,480
I could never find someone like him again.

20
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,340
So...

21
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,220
Whatever the issue is, we should sit down
and talk it through.

22
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,310
When Nüwa created humans,

23
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,970
the purpose of molding a mouth

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,630
was precisely for this.

25
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,150
If I remember correctly,

26
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,520
you previously said that you liked someone

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,040
but he was a scoundrel

28
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,780
who gave away everything you had given him.

29
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,270
You stormed off in a rage.

30
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,270
Is that so?

31
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,560
Did I ever say that?

32
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,850
Y-You might have remembered it wrongly.

33
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,530
My dear disciple.

34
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,840
Do you know why I like to drink?

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Have another story to share?

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,030
Yes.

37
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,890
I'm actually rather timid.

38
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,030
I fell in love with someone
but didn't dare to tell him.

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,740
I only dared to secretly leave

40
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,540
a bouquet of flowers at his doorstep
every few days.

41
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,140
I have picked all the flowers here

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,480
on Yufan Mountain at least once.

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,070
From then on, I wandered everywhere,

44
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,829
leaving new flowers at his door
whenever I found them.

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,060
I drank all day,

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,870
with hopes that after drinking,

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,450
I might become a bit braver.

48
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,000
So that the next time I see him,

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
I'll tell him I like him.

50
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:37,760
Unfortunately, I am uniquely gifted.

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,140
The more I drink, the more sober I become.

52
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,290
It didn't help me build courage at all.

53
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,060
Is this a true story?

54
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,690
This story is also fake.

55
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,750
My dear disciple,

56
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,430
don't learn from your Master.

57
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,890
What’s the use of having a mouth

58
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,800
if you can't speak what's on your mind?

59
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,940
Bai Jiusi.

60
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,020
Why haven't you

61
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,159
come to find me yet?

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,340
Only I could’ve done it.

63
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,950
If it were someone else,

64
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,410
you might end up empty-handed.

65
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,490
These two, one human and one immortal,

66
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,850
perished six hundred years ago.

67
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,380
My Lord, why are you looking for them now?

68
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,360
Six hundred years ago?

69
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,210
Yes.

70
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,310
On the same day, in fact.

71
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,280
Do you know which day it was?

72
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,200
It was...

73
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,760
during the battle when Lord Qing Xu
besieged the Lei Bird.

74
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,980
Many were killed and injured.

75
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,000
They were among them.

76
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,440
So people and immortals who perished
six hundred years ago

77
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,240
couldn't then have appeared
four hundred years ago.

78
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,310
Of course.

79
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,600
When immortals perish, they
completely vanish in the universe.

80
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,820
And even if mortals reincarnate,

81
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,190
they won't be the same person anymore.

82
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,210
[Prosperity]

83
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,560
Grandmaster, this Nightmare Flower is not
from the mortal realm.

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
I, your disciple, am ignorant
and inexperienced.

85
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,120
I truly cannot find a way to detoxify.

86
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,560
[Prosperity]

87
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,750
After all, it was I who brought it here.

88
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,270
Why don't I take Miss Ling'er

89
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,190
back to Canglei Palace to find
Immortal Lord Fan?

90
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,950
You were the one who got away before.

91
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,120
If you go back now, Long Yuan will
surely not let you off easily.

92
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,240
Well, he can punish me if he wants,

93
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,770
but he won't take my life...

94
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,160
right?

95
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,750
Where's Xuan Wei?

96
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,680
He seemed to have been called away
for something.

97
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,740
Is Grandmaster aware that you are
going to Canglei Palace?

98
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,520
Master, the situation is urgent.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't have time to ask for her permission.

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,870
Master, I'm sure you don't want to see Qing...

101
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,360
No.

102
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,950
I'm sure you don't want to see Grandmaster

103
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,610
put herself in danger, right?

104
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,960
The reason I came to you

105
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,870
is because I feel...

106
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,320
you understand that I'm being serious.

107
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,520
The other seniors...

108
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
all just think I'm causing trouble.

109
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,179
But...

110
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,790
Your skills are no match for Canglei Palace.

111
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,380
Master, you don't need to worry
about my safety.

112
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,510
Previously, when Canglei Palace
punished Jingyun Sect,

113
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,840
weren't we given five days as well?

114
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,120
That shows...

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,100
the immortals of Nine Heavens
may not be entirely unreasonable.

116
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,410
Master, you must know best

117
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,970
about the grudge between her
and Heavenly Lord Dacheng, right?

118
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,030
All the more reason for you not to go.

119
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,120
No.

120
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,060
Grandmaster has already told me

121
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,940
all her stories right down

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,330
to the smallest detail.

123
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,480
Master, you're a man,

124
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,950
so you won't understand.

125
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,200
Sometimes...

126
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,720
if a person can tell their story

127
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,080
to a not-so-important friend,

128
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,030
that means she has already let it go.

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
At this time,

130
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,550
she doesn't need someone backing her up,

131
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,120
but a mediator to help them reconcile.

132
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,480
Moreover, all of you

133
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,740
have had conflicts with Canglei Palace.

134
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,460
So I'm the most suitable person for this.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Also...

136
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,820
I think the grudge between her
and Heavenly Lord Dacheng

137
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,090
might not be beyond reconciliation.

138
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,200
This Heavenly Lord Dacheng

139
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,390
may not be as cold-hearted as
she had described.

140
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,210
Master.

141
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,960
I know what you care about most is her safety.

142
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,420
Then all the more you should agree to my plan.

143
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,240
If I can resolve their grudge,

144
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,910
then Canglei Palace and Jingyun Sect

145
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,020
can coexist peacefully, right?

146
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,440
Master, trust me this once.

147
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,550
Since Grandmaster has told you
everything about her past,

148
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,630
it means she trusts you.

149
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,490
Therefore, I trust you too.

150
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
Thank you.

151
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,960
Before I return,

152
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,830
please don't tell Grandmaster.

153
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,440
Qing Yang.

154
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,030
Be careful in everything you do.

155
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,120
If anything happens, just come back.

156
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,080
Don't push yourself too hard.

157
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
I understand.

158
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,800
Oh, right.

159
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,420
Master, do you have any favorite flowers?

160
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,190
I don't like flowers.

161
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,620
Dandelions are not bad though.

162
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,940
I see.

163
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,660
Can you just stop already?

164
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,060
Haven't I already shown you
what you wanted to see?

165
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,590
Why did you summon me again?

166
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,350
I want to see it again.

167
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,400
The ten years when I sealed Ruyue's powers.

168
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,230
I want to see it again.

169
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,630
Are you so shaken that

170
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,890
you’ve lost your mind?

171
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,190
Why are you torturing yourself?

172
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm very clear-headed.

173
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,370
Clearer than ever before.

174
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,870
Who are you?

175
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,380
It's a mortal.

176
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,080
Should I also take a bow here
in the divine realm?

177
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,030
Cut the act.

178
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,440
What's your name?

179
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,630
How did you get up here?

180
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,830
What are you here for?

181
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,650
I'm an elder of Jingyun Sect.

182
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,310
I've come specifically to pay my respects
to Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

183
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,750
It's Heavenly Lord Dacheng!

184
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,790
Jingyun Sect?

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
The sect established by Siling.

186
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,690
Wait, wait.

187
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,870
Who are you two?

188
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,630
I am the Gate-guarding Marshal.

189
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,270
I am the Gate-guarding General.

190
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,240
He's my Senior.

191
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,100
He's my Junior.

192
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,370
Your gestures...

193
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,670
Don't misunderstand.

194
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,790
I'm here on behalf of Jingyun Sect
to seek reconciliation.

195
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,870
Could you please inform
Heavenly Lord Dacheng for me?

196
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,390
Too troublesome, not our business.

197
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,840
At least put in a good word for me.

198
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,360
No.

199
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm Li Qingyue's Master.

200
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,600
By order of rank and relation,

201
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,900
Heavenly Lord Dacheng should also call me Master.

202
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,010
He will definitely see me.

203
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,070
Wait a moment.

204
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,970
Someone from Jingyun Sect has intruded here.

205
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,340
Such audacity.

206
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,510
Showing up here on their own?

207
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,790
Master is away and hasn't returned.

208
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,840
I'll go meet her.

209
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,870
Remember,

210
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,150
don't tell anyone that someone
from Jingyun Sect was here.

211
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,240
Yes, Senior.

212
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,790
So you're from Jingyun Sect.

213
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,790
You're Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

214
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,760
What do you want with my Master?

215
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,030
Heavenly Lord Dacheng is your Master?

216
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,390
You see.

217
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,200
Your Master, Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

218
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,960
and my disciple Qingyue,

219
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
have a tiny misunderstanding.

220
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,390
I want to explain on their behalf.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,130
Misunderstanding?

222
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,910
If that's the case, then come with me.

223
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,570
Where are we going?

224
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,210
Wait, wait for me!

225
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,610
Where were you this morning?

226
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,220
Qing Yang had doubts about her cultivation.

227
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,960
She was afraid of being scolded
by Zi Yang and others,

228
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,620
so she came to see me secretly.

229
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,080
I have been puzzled about
something these days, Master.

230
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,690
Since we returned,

231
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,670
I noticed that you only ordered
the sect to rest,

232
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,960
without making any further plans.

233
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,000
Perhaps you've let go of everything, Master?

234
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,960
Or have you forgotten past grievances?

235
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,240
The grievances still exist.

236
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,640
There are simply more things now that
even I can’t figure out.

237
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,920
Master, please feel free to share.

238
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,880
[Mercy Over All]

239
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,850
Perhaps I can offer you some clarity.

240
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,160
I just suddenly realized

241
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,720
that in the grand scheme of things,

242
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,790
it seems like there's an invisible hand

243
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,190
constantly pushing Bai Jiusi and me apart.

244
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,990
Why do you have such thoughts, Master?

245
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,390
In the past, I was consumed by hatred
and couldn't escape it.

246
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,790
Now that I think about it,

247
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,690
the appearance of this book is
far too much of a coincidence.

248
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,080
The wandering immortal who gave me this book

249
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,270
disappeared after fleeing
and never showed up again.

250
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,630
I can use most of the magical artifacts

251
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,760
listed inside here.

252
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,069
It's as if it was tailor-made for me.

253
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,900
Master, are you suggesting that someone

254
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,410
deliberately gave you this book?

255
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,930
It's just a suspicion of mine.

256
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,240
But failing to kill Bai Jiusi this time

257
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,250
led to an unexpected discovery.

258
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,980
I'm not the only one who
wants to kill Bai Jiusi.

259
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,760
That's why this book appeared.

260
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,349
After all, the magical artifacts inside

261
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,330
can all help me deal with Bai Jiusi.

262
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,920
Can’t say I’ve heard of that.

263
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,880
Who else could have a grudge against
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

264
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,590
Indeed.

265
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,350
It's precisely because I can't figure out

266
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,480
why would others want to kill Bai Jiusi

267
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,220
that I've been bewildered all this time.

268
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,480
I don’t mind others asking me to team up

269
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,540
against Bai Jiusi.

270
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,970
But I don't want to be used either.

271
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,700
If such a person really exists,

272
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,240
then you must be careful, Master.

273
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,160
I don't care what tricks you used
to get in here,

274
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,490
but you can forget about seeing my Master.

275
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,980
I'm here to seek peace, not to cause trouble.

276
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,080
Seeking peace? Another new trick
from Siling, am I right?

277
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,590
Everyone in heaven and earth knows that

278
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,480
Siling is determined to kill my Master.

279
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,410
How could she possibly seek peace?

280
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,310
I came here without her knowledge.

281
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,570
Don't try that with me.

282
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,190
My Master might be deceived by your tricks,

283
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,230
but I won't be.

284
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,630
If you truly want peace,

285
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,920
then get Siling to come to
the Nine Heavens on her knees.

286
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,350
Let me give you some advice.

287
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,720
If you know what's good for you, leave now.

288
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,880
You're not worthy of seeing my Master.

289
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,320
What if I insist on seeing
Heavenly Lord Dacheng today?

290
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,380
Then I will show you no mercy either.

291
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,690
No one came here today.

292
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Forget everything you've seen.

293
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,640
But clearly...

294
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,280
This...

295
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,550
Did you hear me?

296
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,080
Yes, Immortal Lord.

[Temple of the Primordial God]

302
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,030
I deserve to die, Master.

303
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,630
I shouldn't have concealed
Qing Yang's visit to Canglei Palace.

304
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,360
Grandmaster, Junior Qing Yang
was killed by lightning.

305
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,360
All her internal organs have been shattered.

306
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,880
She can't be saved.

307
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,490
[Prosperity]

308
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
If I remember correctly,

309
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,820
Long Yuan from Canglei Palace...

310
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,530
specializes in the Lightning Technique, right?

311
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,590
Yes.

312
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,110
Grandmaster.

313
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,350
Canglei Palace has gone too far.

314
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,590
Junior Qing Yang was gentle in nature.

315
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,310
She went in seek of peace.

316
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,880
Yet, she was killed ruthlessly
by Canglei Palace.

317
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,310
The matter is not clear yet.

318
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,840
Don't jump to conclusions.

319
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,830
Master, what should we do about this?

320
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,490
[Prosperity]

321
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,010
Let's bury her first.

322
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,830
Yes.

324
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,160
Mother!

325
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,790
Mother!

326
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,180
Mother!

327
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,590
Mother!

328
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,030

Can you show me his whereabouts?

331
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,880
I am showing you Hua Ruyue's past

332
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,410
because this is your karma.

333
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,030
As for others' karma,

334
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,980
you have no right to see it.

335
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,070
This person shouldn't have existed.

336
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,000
Whether it's a person or an object,

337
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,750
everything exists for a reason.

338
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,160
You just haven’t grasped

339
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,310
the meaning within.

340
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,310
Everything exists for a reason.

341
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,450
However, I do admire you a bit.

342
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,280
Even while witnessing past tragedies firsthand,

343
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,810
you can still spare attention for others.

[Tomb of Jingyun Sect's Elder Qing Yang]

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,370
Senior Meng.

346
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,790
Do you know why our Grandmaster

347
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,990
had gathered us here?

348
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,310
That's right.

349
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,880
I'm not even a member of the sect,

350
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,410
so why was I called here too?

351
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,570
I don't know either.

352
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,110
Our Grandmaster must have her reasons.

353
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,790
My father just left the sect yesterday.

354
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,450
Could it be that the sect is
going to fight again?

355
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,620
Master Qing Yang sacrificed her life for the sect.

356
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
We must seek justice for her.

357
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,830
We, disciples, pay our respects to Grandmaster.

358
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,270

are those who dare to stay
and confront Canglei Palace.

360
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,030
I thank you all for your assistance.

361
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,000
I am sure everyone would have heard

362
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,690
the death of Master Qing Yang.

363
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,880
Given that Canglei Palace dares to act this way,

364
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,480
it shows that they have no regard
for Jingyun Sect.

We should let them know

366
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,070
that Jingyun Sect is no pushover.

367
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,590
Please give your orders, Grandmaster.
This disciple swears to follow unto death.

368
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,990
This disciple swears to follow unto death.

369
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,550
We don't need them to come
and threaten us this time.

370
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,700
We will go to them.

371
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,000
One.

372
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,830
Two.

373
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,480
Three.

374
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,830
Four.

375
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,780
Five.

376
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,400
Six.

377
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,510
Seven.

378
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,270
Do you think Qing Yang was killed by the Immortal Lord Long Yuan?

379
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,200
One.

380
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,510
Two.

381
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,510
Three.

382
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,350
Rise.

383
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,690
You! Come here quickly to support me.

384
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,050
-What happened?
-Master.

385
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,510
-I feel dizzy.
-Master.

386
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,770
-Is this an earthquake?
-Master.

387
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,700
Are you alright?

388
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,930
Master, look!

389
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,630
Look!

390
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,480
The mountain!

391
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,350
My goodness, how is the mountain flying?

392
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,920
How is it flying so high?

393
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,120
Where is it flying to?

394
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,750
It seems to be flying up to the sky.

395
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,010
Flying up to the sky?

396
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,120
My Bian is still up there!

397
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,870
Young Master!

398
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,400
Bian!

399
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,510
Young Master!

400
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,490
Master, why are you drinking again?

401
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,090
Master.

402
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,970
Everyone has their own path to cultivation.

403
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,400
The path I walk is one of freedom.

404
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,580
And how can there be freedom without wine?

405
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Whatever you say, Master.

406
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,510
On Mount Yuelu in the mortal realm's Yuzhou,

407
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,030
a white tiger has cultivated immortality

408
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,280
and has entered Venerable Xuanyou's realm.

409
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,460
It's waiting to be officially recorded.

410
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,720
I'll find time to check on it tomorrow.

411
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,110
Lord Yu Ya.

412
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,350
It's been a long time since a human
became an immortal.

413
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,860
Indeed.

414
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,030
The last time was when Fan Jiaojiao
and her father ascended to immortality,

415
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,230
which was almost two hundred years ago.

416
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,030
I've heard that human cultivators
are very active in the mortal realm.

417
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,880
How could they be find it more challenging

418
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,410
to achieve immortality than
mountain spirits and tree demons?

419
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,070
Heaven and earth turn in cycles,
and a dark tribulation is upon us.

420
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,480
Spiritual energy in the mortal realm
is scarce.

421
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,010
Humans have built their own roads and cities,

422
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,510
far from the wilderness.

423
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,590
They can't absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth,
or the essence of the sun and moon.

424
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,270
It's difficult for them to cultivate into
immortals or gods.

425
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,240
It's much harder than those
mountain spirits and tree demons.

426
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,310
That makes sense.

427
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,830
You're right.

428
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:04,170
[Human cultivator, Xuan Wei of Jingyun Sect,
Yufan Mountain, Yong region]

429
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,410
This...

430
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,840
It's been hundreds of years.

431
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,100
Finally, a human cultivator has
achieved enlightenment.

432
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,000
Indeed.

433
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,650
But why is there only a name?

434
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,710
There's no rank or immortal position.

435
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,210
[Human cultivator, Xuan Wei of Jingyun Sect,
Yufan Mountain, Yong region]

436
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,910
Xuanwei of Jingyun Sect.

437
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,730
He must be somebody among the human cultivators.

438
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,920
Such a momentous event.

439
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,060
It should be recorded in the immortal annals.

440
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,530
[Human cultivator, Xuan Wei of Jingyun Sect,
Yufan Mountain, Yong region]

441
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,240
Yes, it should be recorded.

442
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,850
Lingshu, bring me a brush.

443
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,060
[Human cultivator, Zi Yang of Jingyun Sect,
Yufan Mountain, Yong region]

444
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,790
What place is this Jingyun Sect?

445
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,830
Two human cultivators have actually
ascended to immortality.

446
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,920
How impressive.

447
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Indeed, I've never heard of them.

448
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,590
Could it be that we divine officials

449
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,390
have been stuck here at
Wenxuan Palace for too long

450
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,640
that we become unaware of

451
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,570
how there's such a powerful sect
in the mortal realm?

452
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,560
[Human cultivator, Jingyun Sect, Zhang Suan,
Human cultivator, Jingyun Sect, Dan Yang]

453
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,790
What's going on?

454
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,960
Master, look.

455
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,040
This...

456
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,300
This is great news!

457
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,730
Wonderful! Good things keep coming!

458
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,300
-Great news indeed!
-It keeps coming!

459
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,630
[Human cultivator, Jingyun Sect, Jiang Bian,
Human cultivator, Jingyun Sect, Lyu Suguan]

460
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,750
This is fantastic!

461
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,380
Isn't it?

462
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,680
Great, great!

463
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,880
The human race is going to prosper!

464
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,440
This is so great!

465
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,020
[Human cultivator, Meng Chu, Jingyun Sect]

466
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,990
[Human cultivator, Shangguan Riyue, Jingyun Sect]

467
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,640
Report!

468
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,920
Reporting to Immortal Lord Long Yuan.

469
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,520
The turbulent clouds seem to indicate
some unusual phenomenon.

470
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,550
Investigate further.

471
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,070
Yes!

472
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,320
It's so beautiful.

473
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,950
This is so beautiful!

474
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,240
This...

475
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,190
This is the Nine Heavens?

476
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,270
Grandmaster.

477
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,510
All disciples of Jingyun Sect are here.

478
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,690
We await your orders, Grandmaster.

479
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
Now that our sect has arrived here
at Nine Heavens,

480
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,440
we should of course inform Canglei Palace.

481
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,920
Allow me to do so.

482
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,050
Jiang Bian, you go deliver the message.

483
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,810
Grandmaster.

484
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,000
My magical power is weak,
and I'm still in my mortal body.

485
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,960
It's my first time in this realm of immortals.

486
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,510
I'm even finding it difficult
to breathe right now.

487
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,310
I can't possibly fly over there!

488
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,240
Don't worry, I'll send you over.

489
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,140
Help!

490
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960

00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,880
I... I am from Jingyun Sect of Yufan Mountain.

A disciple under Elder Dan Yang.

494
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,460
I am here to deliver a message on behalf of
my Grandmaster, Divine Lord Siling.

If you don't come out,

505
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,830
my Grandmaster, Divine Lord Siling,
will come knocking!

506
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,260
Do you hear me?

507
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,960
What did that person say?

508
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,980
Is anyone there?

509
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,180
He said that woman...

510
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,830
She's here!

511
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,830
After four hundred years,

512
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,130
she's finally here.

513
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,840
Let's go.

514
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,320
Wait for me.

515
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,860
Why can't we get out?

516
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,360
I don't believe it.
Is there really a barrier?

517
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,280
I'll go check.

518
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,440
Is that Second Brother
being bounced back again?

519
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,670
Seems like it.

520
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,840
It's me, it's me!

521
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,810
I was bounced back again!

522
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,860
Big Brother, Third Brother,

523
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,940
there really is a barrier.

524
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,510
A barrier set by Bai Jiusi?

525
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,000
That woman got off easy.

526
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,210
There's a sound.

527
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
What is it?

528
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,600
Could... could they be coming out?

529
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,290
You vile weaklings of the divine realm!

530
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,710
Come out!

531
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,870
Come out!

532
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,960
Are you coming out or not?

533
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,320
And you call yourselves immortal lords
of the Nine Heavens.

534
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,920
How can you be so cowardly?

535
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,070
Immortal Lord Long Yuan,

536
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,870
please allow us to go battle him.

537
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,840
That scoundrel has gone too far!

538
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,960
The Heavenly Lord has presided over
Canglei Palace for 300 years.

539
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,220
He has never suffered such humiliation.

540
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,740
We request to fight.

541
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,720
Don't forget what Master said.

542
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,480
Whoever hurts someone from Jingyun Sect

543
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
will have their immortal bones destroyed

544
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,460
and be expelled from Canglei Palace.

545
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,510
So are we just supposed to tolerate
their rampant behavior?

546
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,360
Indeed. A mere mortal

547
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,020
has come knocking at our door.

548
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,890
I've said it before.

549
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,980
Master shouldn't have been
soft-hearted towards her.

550
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,090
Senior.

551
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
Step aside!

552
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,930
I've already sent a Blood Spell to Master.

553
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,070
He'll be back soon.

554
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,310
Senior, I suggest you hold back a bit more.

555
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,480
Don't forget the last time,

556
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,980
Immortal Lord Cang Tu and I had to
speak on your behalf

557
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,910
before you were barely allowed to stay.

558
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,440
If you make a big fuss again,

559
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,290
I'm afraid Master won't let you stay anymore.

560
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,840
Grandmaster, the people inside
don't dare to come out.

561
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,320
There's a barrier at the entrance.

562
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
I can't get in.

563
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,480
If he's unwilling to come out,

564
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,330
then we'll send ourselves in.

565
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,300
It's been a long time, everyone.

566
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,590
When an old friend pays a visit,
shouldn’t you at least come out to greet us?

567
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,990
You even set up a barrier.

568
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,240
This isn’t exactly good hospitality.

569
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,750
Siling,

570
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,930
you dare to bring mortals to
trespass the divine realm.

571
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,190
Do you know your crime?

572
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,370
If you people can go to the mortal realm,

573
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,770
why can't mortals come to the Nine Heavens?

574
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,710
Long Yuan.

575
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,810
since you dare to kill
Jingyun Sect's Master Qing Yang,

576
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,140
you should have expected this day to come.

577
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,070
Don't try to smear me.

578
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,220
Our Master has spared you,

579
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,730
yet you show up here causing trouble?

580
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,930
So you dare not admit to your deed?

581
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,670
It's just a pity that the other disciples

582
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,490
of Canglei Palace who will be
implicated because of you.

583
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,020
Previously, you gave Jingyun Sect five days.

584
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,400
Today, I'll give Canglei Palace one day.

585
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,050
If you can deliver Long Yuan's head tomorrow

586
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,450
as an exchange for a life,

587
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,080
we can let bygones be bygones

588
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,840
and no longer trouble Canglei Palace.

589
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,270
You want my head?

590
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,840
Let's see if you have the ability to take it.

591
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,960
Listen carefully, disciples of Canglei Palace.

592
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,940
If we don't see Long Yuan's head tomorrow,

593
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,000
we'll storm in right in and kill.

594
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,800
If the rest of you want to live,

595
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,090
leave as soon as possible.

596
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,150
Siling.

597
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,070
It's the fifth day by now.

598
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,430
You should return my daughter to me now.

599
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,840
If you want Ling'er,

600
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,490
come to Jingyun Sect yourself to get her.

601
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,360
An old acquaintance has come to see me.
You go back first.

602
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,230
Grand... Grandmaster!

603
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,280
No,

604
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,840
Grandmaster, how am I supposed to go back?

605
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,550
This is way too high!

606
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,920
Heavenly Emissary, if you are here
just to try and mediate,

607
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,180
then there's no need to talk any further.

608
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,630
Siling, you've brought mortals to ascend
to Nine Heavens.

609
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,140
This journey itself violates the order.

610
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,320
Previously, when Long Yuan used
the Skyshade Mirror

611
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,920
to warn the mortal realm,

612
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,850
I didn't see you intervening.

613
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,530
Now that mortals have ascended, you show up.

614
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,260
So? Are immortals allowed to offend mortals
without consequence,

615
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,120
while mortals offending immortals
deserve death?

616
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,800
Bai Jiusi and I

617
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,960
have been in conflict since
the beginning of time.

618
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,710
All these years,

619
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,180
we've never interfered with
the order of this world.

620
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,440
Now that Long Yuan has issued a challenge,

621
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,700
I've come to accept it.

622
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,360
This could also be considered maintaining
the laws of heaven and earth, I suppose.

623
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,020
Even immortals have grudges.

624
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,110
How you settle your private disputes

625
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,710
is indeed beyond my control.

626
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,740
But you shouldn't involve
innocent mortals or immortals.

627
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,150
Long Yuan previously gave
the people of Jingyun Sect

628
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,480
time to leave.

629
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,280
Now, I've also given the disciples
of Canglei Palace

630
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,230
time to leave.

631
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,030
So those who voluntarily stay behind,
be they mortal or immortal,

632
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,710
are doing so on their own free will

633
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,440
and will not implicate others.

634
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,800
Siling, from beginning to end,

635
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,320
there are only two things that I value.

636
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,280
First, maintaining the laws of heaven,

637
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,080
and second, the Infinite Stele.

638
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,410
Long Yuan is Bai Jiusi's chief disciple.

639
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,110
If you kill him, Bai Jiusi naturally
won't stand by idly.

640
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,490
I'm sure you're aware

641
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,000
that although Bai Jiusi is not part of
the heavenly order,

642
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,670
he bears the heavy responsibility of
guarding the Infinite Stele.

643
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,800
If you're acting out of selfish desire

644
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,070
and endanger the existence of
the Infinite Stele,

645
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,330
I'd of course not stand by and do nothing.

646
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,710
If this is what you're concerned about,

647
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,800
I can assure you

648
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:49,920
that Bai Jiusi and I

649
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,230
are both formed from the vital energy of
the Primordial God.

650
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,430
Our powers are equal.

651
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,400
What he can do, I can as well.

652
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,760
Regardless of who lives or dies between us,

653
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,630
someone will always guard the Infinite Stele.

654
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,110
The Infinite Stele is not something you can

655
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,840
casually make promises about.

656
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,590
Without proof, why should I believe you?

657
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,970
After tomorrow passes, you will
know everything.

658
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,190
Regardless of the outcome,

659
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,230
once this matter is settled,

660
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,710
I will bring Jingyun Sect back
from the Nine Heavens.

661
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,570
I will certainly not disrupt
the order of the world.

662
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,710
Alright, I'll trust you this once.

663
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,880
If you harbor any deceit,

664
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,850
you will surely face divine punishment.

665
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,710
I will never break my word.
