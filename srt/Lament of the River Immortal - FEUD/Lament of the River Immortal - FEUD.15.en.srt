17
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,070
Why do divine beings choose to
go through tribulations in the mortal realm?

18
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,440
Because there's too much suffering here.

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,710
Mortals are faced with
problems at all ages,

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,360
If all divine beings
empathize with mortals,

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,910
they can't refrain from
interfering with heaven's will

with their power, can they?

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,800

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,790
Master, I'm having a good enough life now.

186
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,400
Does "good" refer to

187
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,550
bustling about and endangering your life?

188
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,430
Master, you don't understand.

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,330
Since the day I was born,

190
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,840
droughts have happened every year.

191
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,970
with no end in sight.

192
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,910
I saw people starve to death
in this messed-up world.

193
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,620
That's why I chose to become an official.

194
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,780
I once worshipped the gods,

195
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,080
putting all my trust in them.

196
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,140
But then I realized

197
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:59,000
that officials and gods
couldn't be of help.

198
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,150
People need to have faith
in something, right?

199
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,030
So, now, I believe in myself.

200
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,320
Master,

201
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,360
save that housekeeper job for me.

202
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,990
After I slay the Drought Dragon,

203
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,920
I'll come to you.

204
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,250
What if you can never
find the Drought Dragon?

205
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,050
In that case,

206
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,630
I'll have to see you
again in my next life.

207
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,850
You can also believe in me.

208
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,360
What?

209
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,240
Trust me.

210
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,380
I'll help you slay the Drought Dragon.

211
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,510
This is Mount Wuju,

212
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,130
where the Drought Dragon resides.

213
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,270
Will the droughts be ended

214
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,790
if I kill the dragon?

215
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,950
The Drought Dragon is driven

216
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,640
by its nature to disturb the mortal realm.

217
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,670
Perhaps it doesn't mean to cause droughts.

218
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,740
Maybe it doesn't have to die.

219
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,570
What else can we do?

220
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,870
Chishui River purges all evil.

221
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,320
It can neutralize
the Drought Dragon's dryness.

222
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,720
If the dragon agrees to go back
to the north of Chishui River

223
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,210
and stop harming the mortal realm,

224
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,810
then we won't have to kill it.

225
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,360
But what if it disagrees?

226
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,480
Then we'll slay it without mercy.

227
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,790
Go!

228
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,480
Master.

229
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,990
Divine Lord Siling?

230
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,030
Droughts have prevailed
and taken many lives.

231
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,930
You are responsible for it.

232
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,760
If there is a shred of sympathy in you,

233
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,350
you should go back to Chishui River now

234
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,280
and stop harming the mortal realm.

235
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,110
I made a huge contribution by
quelling the water demon unrest

236
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,510
in the North Sea.

237
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,030
The celestial realm rewarded me

238
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,800
with the privilege
to travel the Three Realms

239
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,630
with no restraint.

240
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,860
I'm afraid I can't follow your command.

241
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Your freedom must

242
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,270
make way for the wellbeing
of the Three Realms.

243
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,350
The Three Realms?

244
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,400
You're only talking about humans.

245
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,710
Just like fallen leaves
and withered flowers,

246
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,720
their lives

247
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,440
don't matter at all, do they?

248
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,590
I thought you weren't
aware you were doing evil.

249
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,590
But in fact, you're knowingly
doing it without remorse.

250
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,480
In that case,

251
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,770
your life must be ended.

252
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,270
Master!

253
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,080
Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

254
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,720
Heavenly Emissary.

255
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,550
Is there a decree from the Empyrean?

256
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,290
You're adventuring with Siling
in the mortal realm.

257
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,350
Do you know what she is up to right now?

258
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
She is trying to kill a divine being.

259
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,590
Things form, exist, decay and vanish.

260
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,070
The circle of life never ceases to be.

261
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,470
That's the law of heaven.

262
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,870
Now, by attempting
to slay the Drought Dragon.

263
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,740
she's not only committing
the crime of killing a divine being,

264
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,870
but also obstructing the cycle of life

265
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,830
and breaching the law of heaven.

266
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,020
You came here with her.

267
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,400
You must do something
when she makes a terrible mistake.

268
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,640
What do you want me to do?

269
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,420
To stop her and to bring her
back to the Empyrean for punishment.

270
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,830
Master!

271
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,110
Master!

272
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,350
Master, it's dying.

273
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,770
Go. Kill it now.

274
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,240
Got it.

275
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,880
Hua Ruyue, how dare you
kill a divine being?

276
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,370
It should be punished by the heaven

277
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,220
for the crimes it may have committed,

278
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,350
instead of you.

279
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,530
What did the heaven do
when droughts happened?

280
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,300
What did the heaven do
when people starved to death?

281
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,510
If the heaven is as merciless
as you make it sound to be,

282
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,590
why not defy it?

283
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,680
Master!

284
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,290
Meng Changqin, what are you waiting for?

285
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,830
Both mortals

286
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,310
and divine beings

287
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,200
must obey the heaven!

288
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,830
Master, I'm unable to kill it!

289
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,920
Changqin, this is a justifiable killing.

290
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,110
Believe in yourself, and you'll succeed!

291
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,540
As a divine being, you're
harming the mortal realm.

292
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,740
If all divine beings are like you,

293
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,320
mortals have every right to kill them!

294
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,310
Finally... I did it!

295
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
Bai Jiusi, where is Meng Changqin?

296
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,310
He's in a coma, but he's fine.

297
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,550
Good.

298
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,520
I'm relieved.

299
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,130
You know what?
We slayed the Drought Dragon today

300
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,770
and ended the droughts.

301
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,400
From now on, people won't starve anymore.

302
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,550
I know.

303
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,750
Do you think I did wrong?

304
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,240
Yes.

305
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,310
Why?

306
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,160
I offered you my advice,

307
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,240
but you didn't heed my words.

308
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
You said mortals were as insignificant

309
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,440
as ordinary animals.

310
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,960
But that is not true.

311
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,270
I saw Meng Chi

312
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,650
creating colorful paintings,

313
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,920
though he was born

314
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,440
color-blind.

315
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,160
I saw Meng Changqin,

316
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,790
a mortal though he is,

317
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,640
slaying the Drought Dragon
with a blunt blade.

318
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,590
Even divine beings can't achieve these.

319
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,440
So what?

320
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,370
"So what"?

321
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,920
Bai Jiusi, do you know what you're saying?

322
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,050
I'm always clear about what I'm doing.

323
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,490
You're the one who is not of

324
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,110
sound mind.

325
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,270
We came to the mortal realm

326
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,200
to overcome the love tribulation.

327
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,240
I told you

328
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,440
not to recklessly use your power here

329
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,840
and not to cause trouble.

330
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,330
But what have you done?

331
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,550
You've used your power
to save lives several times.

332
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,590
You even killed
the Drought Dragon for mortals!

333
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,790
The dragon was at fault!

334
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,990
Right and wrong can't be easily judged.

335
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,900
I only care about the results.

336
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Hua Ruyue, you promised
that helping Meng Changqin

337
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
was an one-off thing,

338
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,510
which made me agree to pass
the love tribulation with you.

339
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,030
But now you've broken your promise.

340
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,750
You've violated the heaven's rules.

341
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,520
I can't be tolerant of you anymore.

342
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,880
What are you going to do?

343
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm going back.

344
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,680
What did you say?

345
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,740
I'm going back to the Nine Heavens

346
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,240
to atone for my sin of coming to
the mortal realm without permission.

347
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,770
You're going to kill me?

348
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,440
No, I'm not.

349
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,260
But I'll seal the spiritual energy in you

350
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,520
to show the Heavenly
Emissary what stance I take.

351
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,750
I have nothing to do with

352
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
what you've done.

353
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,920
Bai Jiusi!

354
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
You like mortals, don't you?

355
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,440
Your spiritual energy
will be sealed for ten years,

356
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,040
so you have to live as
a mortal here for a decade.

357
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,400
Meanwhile,

358
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,350
I can go back to
the Nine Heavens, all innocent.

359
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,850
This is the best for us.

360
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,690
You can't do this to me.

361
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,010
You can't do this to me.

362
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,640
I thought

363
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,160
you truly loved me
during the several decades

364
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,920
we spent together in the mortal realm.

365
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,200
But as it turns out,

366
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,920
that was all a delusion.

367
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,830
You're actually

368
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,880
heartless and selfish!

369
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,570
Now I understand...

370
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,640
It's no wonder that you don't

371
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,100
want to have a baby with me,

372
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,400
and that you've never helped me!

373
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,860
Am I also an insignificant

374
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
being in your eyes?

375
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,880
You're sweet and nice when you need me.

376
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,280
But you would discard me instantly

377
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,170
when I go against your interests!

378
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,220
I did give you options.

379
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,240
And this is the one you chose.

380
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,880
It will be over soon.

381
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,790
You won't be in pain for long.

382
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,350
No...

383
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,880
Let go of me!

384
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,400
Let go!

385
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,730

386
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,460

402
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,030
Master Qing Yang,

403
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,240
Do you really not know anything?

404
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,070
Why did Master Xuan Wei, the Sect Leader

405
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,440
and others suddenly head to and come back

406
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,700
from the Nine Heavens?

407
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,200
How am I supposed to know why?

408
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
It makes sense for disciples
not having the answer.

409
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,440
But, Master, you hold
an important position.

410
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,830
How could you not know the truth?

411
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,270
-That's right.
-That's right.

412
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,240
Zip it, lad!

413
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,350
Senior Zhang?

414
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,480
Senior Zhang, you're back.

415
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,370
When did you come back?

416
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,880
In the early morning.

417
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,240
Early morning?

418
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,270
That is to say,

419
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,210
you returned with
the Sect Leader and the others.

420
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,400
Do you know what Master Xuan Wei

421
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,160
and the Sect Leader went

422
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,400
to the Nine Heavens for?

423
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,480
Yeah. The fellows we hang out with

424
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,590
suddenly changed.

425
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,710
Their power became stronger,

426
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,800
and their demeanor
and temperament different!

427
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,630
Senior Zhang, did the Sect Leader

428
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,440
feed them magical

429
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,969
pills or elixirs in secret?

430
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,210
I don't know.

431
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,639
What? You're highly valued by the sect.

432
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,920
How can you not know?

433
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,320
Everyone here is
a top disciple of the sect.

434
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,030
Except me.

435
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,070
Yes, except you.

436
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,070
Those who went up

437
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,360
are small-time outer-circle disciples,

438
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,550
including cleaners and food servers.

439
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,710
Indeed.

440
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,880
Yeah.

441
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,550
Right.

442
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,150
The Heaven-Turning Seal
contains immense power.

443
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,880
It broke and left no trail.

444
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,840
It could be in the Empyrean, the Hell,

445
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,760
the Three Realms, the Six Paths,
the Eight Desolations

446
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,190
or the Four Seas.

447
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,360
Just because we can't find it

448
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,920
doesn't mean those
in Canglei Palace can't.

449
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,280
Long Yuan is Heavenly Lord
Dacheng's closest disciple.

450
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,110
He must know how to find the lord.

451
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,590
Grandmaster and the lord
disappeared together.

452
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,000
They must've gone to the same place.

453
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,710
As long as we find Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

454
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,230
we'll find Grandmaster.

455
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,510
Senior, during the battle at Tianmu Peak,

456
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,360
I placed an All-Hearing Tag on Long Yuan.

457
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,400
I'll know whatever happens

458
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,030
in Canglei Palace.

459
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,150
Excellent.

460
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,110
Master's safety is of vital importance.

461
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,400
No mistake is allowed.

462
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,630
Yes. I'll send the disciples

463
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,960
out for a thorough search

464
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,090
in all the 12 states.

465
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,590
Dan Yang, since you've
placed an All-Hearing Tag,

466
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,480
you should stay in the sect

467
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,740
and monitor the activities
in Canglei Palace in real time.

468
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,400
Yes.

469
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,670
Zi Yang, tell your fellows to split up

470
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800
and search every corner.

471
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,760
I'll be in seclusion in the back mountain

472
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,000
to see if the Spirit Inquiry Formation
will reveal Master's whereabouts.

473
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,670
Everyone, be keen aware

474
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,710
that this matter
related to Divine Lord Siling

475
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,920
decides the fate of Jingyun Sect.

476
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,280
We must find her at all costs.

477
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
I have a question.

478
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,530
Go do your work, everyone.

479
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,710
You may leave now.

480
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,710
-Yes.
-Yes.

481
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,690
[Prosperity]

482
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,590
What do you want to ask?

483
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:39,260
[May your spirit shine across all realms]

484
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,760
Master, you know what it is.

485
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,710
You already have the answer,

486
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,710
don't you?

487
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,430
I want to hear you say it, Master.

488
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:54,660
There is no such a person as Li Qingyue,
a disciple of Jingyun Sect.

489
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,220
But Divine Lord Siling,
an immortal, truly exists.

490
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,940
300 years ago,

491
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,670
Grandmaster battled
Heavenly Lord Dacheng Bai Jiusi

492
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,630
in Canglei Palace.

493
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,690
Her body was destroyed,

494
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,670
but her primordial spirit lingered.

495
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,800
With humiliation, she hid
in the mortal realm

496
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,650
for 300 years

497
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,880
because those in Canglei
Palace tried to hunt her down.

498
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,210
Then, she became a mentor to
Master Xuan Wei and some others,

499
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,370
namely the top members
of the previous generation.

500
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,820
She taught them techniques and helped them

501
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,710
establish Jingyun Sect.

502
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,070
That was when she was
reborn in Li Qingyue's body,

503
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,870
who drowned in a flood.

504
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,070
She then became a disciple

505
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,230
of our sect as a disguise.

506
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,230
It's fair to say that helping
Grandmaster get her power back

507
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,880
and return to the Nine Heavens
is the original purpose

508
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,170
of founding Jingyun Sect.

509
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,550
Well...

510
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,530
What about Qingyue?

511
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,070
This mediocre girl, Li Qingyue,

512
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,000
is just Grandmaster's disguise.

513
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,550
Qingyue already died

514
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,810
in a flood in her childhood.

515
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,230
Zhang Suan, you're deeply involved.

516
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,150
Your judgement is inevitably clouded.

517
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,340
Once you extricate yourself from it,

518
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,240
you'll see the truth.

519
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,300
How silly of me.

520
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,500
Zhang Suan,

521
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,510
you went to the Nine Heavens
by climbing the Sky-Reaching Ladder.

522
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,360
I didn't expect that at all.

523
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,510
It's the sect's fault for
delaying your development.

524
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,110
That's not what I care about.

525
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,670
The shining sun is far beyond your reach.

526
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,590
Why stare at it and hurt yourself?

527
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,880
I've overestimated myself.

528
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,030
There's no such thing as perfection.

529
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,070
You're already blessed
to be in the same sect

530
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,190
as Grandmaster.

531
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,590
When Grandmaster comes back,

532
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,680
you'll be rewarded.

533
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,800
Now,

534
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,150
I understand.
