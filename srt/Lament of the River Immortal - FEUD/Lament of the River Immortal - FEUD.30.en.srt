[Episode 30]

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,900
Mother, are you alright?

4
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,740
He got ahead of us.

5
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,509
Master.

6
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,400
I will find a way to avenge you.

7
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,920
Xiao Jingshan!

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,640
I will definitely kill you!

9
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,400
I've told you

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,430
only the chosen one can live.

11
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,940
Mother.

12
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,750
-If you don't choose...
-Mother.

13
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,360
Mother!

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,010
You'll all die.

15
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,540
Mother.

16
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,970
Please save her quickly.

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,350
Mother.

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,579
Come on.

19
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,900
Mother.

20
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,670
Mother.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,750
Don't scare me.

22
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:32,840
Mother.

23
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,470
I won't run around recklessly anymore.

24
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,150
Mother.

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,560
I won't run around recklessly anymore!

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,220
Don't leave me!

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,510
Mother!

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Mother!

29
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,520
Even if they find this place,

30
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,310
they won't be able to break in.

31
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,590
Let's rest here for a moment

32
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,190
and figure out our next move.

33
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,340
What's wrong?

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,330
Divine Lord.

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,680
To be honest,

36
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,910
I've already found
the eye of the formation on the street.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,450
It's on the paving stone we stepped on.

38
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,180
If we can enter it,
we can control the Joy Stele

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,540
and open an exit for everyone to leave.

40
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,800
Isn't that a good thing?

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Why do you still look so worried?

42
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,140
It's nothing.

43
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,780
I just feel that

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
I found the eye of the formation
too easily.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Could it be a trap?

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,100
But we're out of time.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,329
After tomorrow,

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,430
the people's physical bodies
left outside the illusion

49
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,630
will die completely.

50
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,520
We have to give it a shot.

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,710
Tell me how to enter the formation's eye

52
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,170
and control the Joy Stele.

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,079
We must open an exit tomorrow

54
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,740
to let the people leave first.

55
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,630
No.

56
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,750
Lend me some of your spiritual energy
tomorrow.

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,210
I'll break the formation.

58
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,720
Tell me how to do it.

59
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,610
I can do it.

60
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,390
This formation is quite complex.

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,670
I can't explain it clearly
in such a short time.

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,430
Let me do it.

63
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,110
You just need to protect me

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,920
and make sure no one disturbs me.

65
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,040
Divine Lord,

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,510
actually, opening an exit
from the illusion isn't difficult.

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,890
The illusion of this Joy Stele

68
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,950
was created in a very mysterious way.

69
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,480
The people inside can't leave

70
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,630
unless they're willing to.

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,030
They can't be forced out.

72
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,040
They trust Xiao Jingshan completely

73
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,040
and see us as evil spirits.

74
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm afraid that making them leave
willingly

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
won't be an easy task.

76
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,030
He sure knows how to manipulate people.

77
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,470
If we let these people

78
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,050
see with their own eyes
that this illusion is fake

79
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,270
and that they'll lose their lives
if they don't leave,

80
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,670
they may not want to stay.

81
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,280
Human nature isn't as straightforward
as you make it sound.

82
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,320
We'll do our best

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
and leave the rest to fate.

84
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,240
We'll act according to the situation then.

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,950
Are you done talking?

86
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,630
You two,

87
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,270
go inside for a while.

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,020
I have something to say to her.

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,530
Could you two give us some privacy?

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,120
Go on, get inside.

91
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,950
Get inside, get inside.

92
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,810
Don't come out.

93
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,590
Don't come out without my order, got it?

94
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,980
What do you want to say?

95
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,230
Why have the flowers wilted?

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,620
My love,

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,280
this is what I wanted to give you.

98
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,950
When did you pick them?

99
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,390
When we were at the foot of the mountain.

100
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,250
I could have picked more flowers,

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,830
but you were in such a hurry to leave.

102
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,620
So I only picked these.

103
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,830
What's that about?

104
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,170
I really treat him like a child?

105
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,140
My love,

106
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,550
don't you like them?

107
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,950
I like them.

108
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,210
I'm glad you like them.

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,940
Come on.

110
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,320
You are truly beautiful.

111
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,040
Bai Jiusi.

112
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,530
If only I could be like you,

113
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,880
forgetting everything from the past,

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,720
how wonderful that would be.

115
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,670
Now is a critical moment.

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,600
His Lordship now has the mind of a child.

117
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,510
We can't think of any solutions
right now anyway.

118
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,640
Just humor him a bit.

119
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,050
Zhang Suan.

120
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,000
What is it?

121
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,850
Could you like me for a moment?

122
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,870
I'm really curious

123
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,210
about what it feels like

124
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,130
to be liked by someone.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,080
It's alright.

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,730
I was just asking casually.

128
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,670
Xingman.

129
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
It's all my fault.

130
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,860
I'm not capable enough
to protect everyone.

131
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,900
But you must trust me.

132
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,600
This revenge

133
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,650
will definitely be taken.

134
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,310
Jealous?

135
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,160
Stop finding me out.

136
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,020
Only you can hear my words.

137
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,400
I can make Meng Chu only like you.

138
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,620
Actually, I have no hostility towards you.

139
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,510
I just don't want you to get involved in

140
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,370
the strife between Siling and me.

141
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,320
That's why I lured you here.

142
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,290
I've come to understand you along the way.

143
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,720
You've grown up

144
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,440
with your senior since childhood,

145
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,150
but when danger comes, you're the only one

146
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,270
who's ignored

147
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,700
and abandoned.

148
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
Don't you hate it?

149
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,750
Don't you want Qu Xingman to disappear?

150
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,670
I can make a deal with you.

151
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Kill Qu Xingman,

152
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,730
and I'll make him only like you
in the future.

153
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,650
Do you think I'm stupid?

154
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,840
If I kill Qu Xingman,

155
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,590
he'll surely hate me to the core.

156
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,740
How could he then only like me?

157
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,390
This is the Blood Chime,
a magical artifact I created.

158
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,440
Whether it's birds, beasts, or humans,

159
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,240
as long as you drop blood on it,

160
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,390
they will obey all your commands

161
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,650
and be at your disposal.

162
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,150
You know its power.

163
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,100
Why do you want to kill Qu Xingman?

164
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,990
Actually, I have no grudge against her.

165
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,130
I just can't stand seeing sincere people

166
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,580
always being let down.

167
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,630
I want to help you.

168
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,550
Junior.

169
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,620
Have you finished giving them the pills?

170
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,750
Yes.

171
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,840
Can your Blood Chime

172
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,670
really control people's minds?

173
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,190
Try it and see.

174
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,880
Let's begin.

175
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,480
Divine Lord,

176
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,680
we can start now.

177
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,360
Come.

178
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,790
Stay still and don't move.

179
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,970
Be careful, my love.

180
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,330
The Hell

181
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,620
summons the souls.

182
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,670
How did I get here?

183
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,550
-Why am I on the street?
-What happened?

184
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,120
Wasn't I getting dressed at home?

185
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,310
How did I end up here?

186
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,360
They must have used some kind of sorcery

187
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,270
to lure us here!

188
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,230
Them! It's them! Must be them!

189
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,130
-It must be them!
-It must be them!

190
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,730
Everyone!

191
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,300
Please hear me out.

192
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,090
The place where you are now

193
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,740
is just an illusion.

194
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,960
The so-called Heavenly Lord you speak of

195
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,780
has trapped your souls here.

196
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,040
After today,

197
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,330
your physical bodies will die,

198
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,750
and your souls will never
be able to return.

199
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,670
What souls?

200
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,840
-What illusion?
-You're lying.

201
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,080
Stop trying to deceive us with those lies.

202
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,600
Whether it's true or false,

203
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,130
you'll know once you see it.

204
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,600
We just want you to live safely.

205
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,800
Ling'er.

206
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,490
Don't try to deceive us.

207
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,950
-Why should we listen to her?
-She wants to harm us.

208
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,320
They're evil spirits.

209
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,870
Look what kind of sorcery
these evil spirits are using.

210
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,000
They're just liars.

211
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,350
We won't believe them.

212
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,320
How could the Heavenly Lord harm us?

213
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
-You liar.
-Yeah.

214
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,480
Big liars.

215
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,870
How can we trust anything they say?

216
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,000
They're spreading lies to confuse us.

217
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
-Liars.
-We're doing well here.

218
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,360
Exactly.

219
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's drive them away quickly.

220
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,530
Look, look.

221
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,780
They're still using sorcery.

222
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,300
-Look, look.
-It's sorcery.

223
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,430
What place is that?

224
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,370
Open!

225
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,240
This is impossible!

226
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,170
This must be their sorcery at work!

227
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,510
Do you see?

228
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,300
Outside is the real world where you live.

229
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,660
Everything here

230
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,600
is fabricated by him
using magical artifacts.

231
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,510
How could this be?

232
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,550
I believe in the Heavenly Lord.

233
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,620
I believe in him too.

234
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,480
Heavenly Lord.

235
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,240
Are they lying to us?

236
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,220
Heavenly Lord,

237
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,940
are they slandering you?

238
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,340
Right, Heavenly Lord.

239
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,630
This place is indeed an illusion.

240
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Impossible!

241
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,490
-Impossible!
-How could it be?

242
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,550
How could here possibly be an illusion?

243
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,830
No way!

244
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,800
Do you still want to lie paralyzed in bed

245
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,160
and be called useless by others?

246
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,020
I don't want to.

247
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,200
I-I don't!

248
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,680
Do you still want to have red spots
on your face

249
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,280
and be called ugly by others?

250
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,640
No.

251
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I don't want that.

252
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
I don't want that!

253
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,740
Do you still want to beg on the streets

254
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,310
and be beaten and cursed by others?

255
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,170
I don't want to.

256
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,350
I don't want to beg anymore.

257
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,810
I don't want to be beaten
and cursed anymore.

258
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,210
No, no, no!

259
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,560
No, no, no!

260
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,570
No, no, no!

261
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,960
So,

262
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,720
even though this is an illusion,

263
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,070
are you willing to leave?

264
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,540
No, I don't want to!

265
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,070
I want to stay, Heavenly Lord!

266
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,980
I won't leave!

267
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,940
I want to stay too!

268
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,100
See?

269
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,750
This is human nature.

270
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,270
You're clearly exploiting their suffering.

271
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,270
My love.

272
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,020
Siling,

273
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,250
what gives you the right to judge me?

274
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,540
Didn't you give up on her too?

275
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,350
What do you mean?

276
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,230
To destroy this formation,

277
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,730
someone must be sacrificed
to become the eye of the formation.

278
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,960
Don't pretend you don't know.

279
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,670
Let's leave this place first.

280
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,680
When we reach the Jingyun Sect,

281
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
the elders will surely rescue them.

282
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,920
Junior.

283
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,940
What's wrong?

284
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,720
Senior,

285
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,000
this is a pill to ward off the evil.

286
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
The one we took when we came
has already worn off.

287
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,930
You'd better take another one.

288
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,280
Have one too.

289
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,500
I don't need it.

290
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,030
Xingman,

291
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,560
you got injured.

292
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,360
Taking a pill will make you feel better.

293
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,900
Divine Lord.

294
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,690
My love!

295
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,270
My love, are you alright?

296
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm fine.

297
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,190
Is what he said true?

298
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,400
It's true.

299
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,120
Why didn't you tell me?

300
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,090
Divine Lord,

301
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,060
sacrificing my life

302
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,940
for hundreds of other lives

303
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,580
is worth it.

304
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,910
No way!

305
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,080
How could she trade her life for ours?

306
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,150
Your life is as valuable as others'.

307
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,480
It's not worth it at all.

308
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,380
This is my choice.

309
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,330
As a useless person,

310
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,720
I'm glad to be able to

311
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,980
do one last thing for you.

312
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,560
I won't let you die.

313
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,090
Ling'er!

314
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,720
Is it true?

315
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,930
She's already the formation's eye
of the Joy Stele.

316
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,500
If you destroy the formation's eye,

317
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,930
you'll destroy her too.

318
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,830
Divine Lord,

319
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,120
don't worry about me.

320
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,660
Save the others first.

321
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,630
This is a place of ultimate bliss.

322
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,250
Who needs your saving?

323
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
Stop acting like a self-righteous savior.

324
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,980
No one will be grateful to you.

325
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,020
I will.

326
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,790
I'm a coward,

327
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,090
a beggar
whose life is worth less than dirt.

328
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,960
When I realized something was wrong here,

329
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,420
I chose to live here in self-deception.

330
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,400
But now it's different.

331
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,710
Someone is willing to

332
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,390
sacrifice her life

333
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,010
to save a beggar
whose name she doesn't even know.

334
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,700
I can't let them down anymore.

335
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,750
Well...

336
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,700
He just discarded them
without a second thought.

337
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
-How could he bear to do so?
-Well...

338
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,520
Thank you.

339
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,160
Well...

340
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,480
Shouldn't we hurry back too?

341
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,740
You want to go back?

342
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,410
Staying here isn't right.

343
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,120
Well said.

344
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,830
This ugly face

345
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,840
can scare away shallow men

346
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,010
who judge people by their appearance.

347
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,310
That makes sense.

348
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,040
Thank you.

349
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,710
Then I'll go back too.

350
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,550
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

351
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,030
Let's go. We'll go back too.

352
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,750
Thank you.

353
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,900
Let's go.

354
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,370
I'm leaving too.

355
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,570
Thank you.

356
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,780
Thank you.

357
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,030
Let's go.

358
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,000
Hurry and leave.

359
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,070
Thank you.

360
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,160
-This place is fake.
-Yeah.

361
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,810
Let's go.

362
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,510
Thank you.

363
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,030
Thank you.

364
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,160
We're leaving too.

365
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:39,960
Let's go.

366
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,760
Thank you.

367
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,310
Let's go.

368
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,960
Thank you.

369
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,410
Thank you.

370
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,080
Let's go.

371
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,430
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

372
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,030
Thank you.

373
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,500
Thank you.

374
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,090
Thanks.

375
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,290
My fellow villagers,

376
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,930
come on,

377
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,600
let's thank them together.

378
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:08,720
Thank you all.

379
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,590
Xiao Jingshan.

380
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,830
Thank you all. Thanks. Thank you all.

381
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,400
You're the one
who doesn't understand human nature.

382
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,880
Thank you all. Thank you all.

383
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,080
Thank you. Thank you.

384
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,340
What medicine did you give her?

385
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,790
Poison.

386
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,640
Why hasn't there been any reaction yet?

387
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,190
Are you deceiving me?

388
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,550
Of course not.

389
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,310
I've removed the snake vines.

390
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,830
And I've given you
the Blood Chime in advance.

391
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,310
If you go back on your word,

392
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,740
none of you three can leave here.

393
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Just wait and see.

394
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,570
Xingman!

395
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,820
Xingman!

396
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,690
-Xingman.
-It hurts.

397
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,640
What's wrong with you?

398
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,350
Junior!

399
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Check on Xingman!

400
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,450
Xingman.

401
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,040
What exactly did you put

402
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,670
in the pill you just gave me?

403
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,250
It's exactly what you're thinking.

404
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,210
What do you mean?

405
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,390
Xingman.

406
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,860
Xingman!

407
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,350
Junior.

408
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,470
Stop fooling around.

409
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,870
Give me the antidote.

410
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,700
There is no antidote.

411
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,480
She must die.

412
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,690
Is there an antidote or not?

413
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,660
No.

414
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,210
I'll ask you one last time.

415
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,030
Is there an antidote or not?

416
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,550
No.

417
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,670
You really dare to gamble, huh?

418
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,180
In my opinion,

419
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,010
your senior
may not have the heart to harm you.

420
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,290
Let's go.

421
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,070
Bring her along.

422
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
We're going back to the sect.

423
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,080
Satisfied now?

424
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,690
Let's go!

425
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,980
You want to leave?

426
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,700
It's not that easy!

427
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,470
My love!

428
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,070
Leave now.

429
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,540
Go!

430
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,500
Go!

431
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,460
Hurry! Go, go, go!

432
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,880
Go! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

433
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,890
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Keep up! Go!

434
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,750
Go! Hurry!

435
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,610
-Let's go! Go!
-Let's go! Come on!

436
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,110
Go! Hurry! Go!

437
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,710
Hurry! Quick, quick, quick!

438
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,030
Bai Jiusi!

439
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,900
Go!

440
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,120
Hurry! Go!

441
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,290
Hurry! Quick! Go!

442
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,400
Go!

443
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,520
Go!

444
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,730
Bai Jiusi.

445
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,000
My love.

446
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,500
I'm fine.

447
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,440
It doesn't hurt.

448
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,180
Bai Jiusi.

449
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,290
Bai Jiusi!

450
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,470
Ignorant youngster.

451
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,440
After sparring with me for a few moves,

452
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,370
you really think you can take me on?

453
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,410
Your techniques and cultivation
all came from me.

454
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,990
Your life

455
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,570
is at my disposal.

456
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,530
Qiankun solidification.

457
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,990
Yin and Yang interaction.

458
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,300
Siling.

459
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,540
You've lost your Life-Protecting Pearl.

460
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,800
Now, let's see

461
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,920
how you'll escape this formation.

462
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,030
Divine Lord!

463
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,750
Watch out!

464
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,840
Zhang Suan!

465
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,120
You actually destroyed the power
I bestowed upon you.

466
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,460
If being someone's puppet is the only way
to obtain this opportunity,

467
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,610
I'd rather not

468
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,350
have it.

469
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,340
You're truly willing to degrade yourself.

470
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,630
Seems you haven't had enough
of being useless.

471
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,310
Zhang Suan!

472
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,690
Without your power,

473
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,520
you're nothing but an ant
for me to trample.

474
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,750
What are you laughing at?

475
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,719
Laughing at how pitiful you are.

476
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,040
Even ants have their companions
to protect them.

477
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,030
But you?

478
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,920
You're like a stray dog,

479
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
wandering in this world.

480
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,000
When your dark magic is exhausted,

481
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,150
I'm afraid no one will
even collect your corpse.

482
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,610
All these actions of yours

483
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,800
only show how pathetic you are.

484
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,230
Pathetic?

485
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:15,960
Fine.

486
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,140
Then I'll let you see with your own eyes

487
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,300
who wins in the end.

488
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,250
Senior!

489
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,420
Shangguan!

490
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,180
The strongest sect in the Three Realms?

491
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,370
Without Siling,

492
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,260
you are nothing at all.

493
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,770
Hand over the Qiyue Sword now.

494
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,530
Don't even think about it.

495
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,000
What's the use of profound power?

496
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,080
You're still just a lowly demon
from the demon clan.

497
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,000
You filthy thing.

498
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,550
You've fallen to such a state,

499
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,550
yet you still dare to speak like this?

500
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,070
Aren't you afraid of death, old man?

501
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,370
Cultivators in the Jingyun Sect

502
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,040
cultivate the righteous path
of the universe.

503
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,110
What is there to fear from mere demons?

504
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,590
Master!

505
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,840
Ning Yan!

506
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,960
I'll kill you!

507
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,960
Let me go!

508
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,030
Let me go.

509
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,870
Let me go.

510
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,550
Let me go.

511
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,920
Dad, don't forget that you promised

512
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,480
to take me to the lantern fair tonight.

513
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,590
Great! Show us another round!

514
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,290
Let me go.

515
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,180
I'll say it one more time.

516
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,430
Hand over the Qiyue Sword,

517
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,890
and I can spare your lives.

518
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,920
You treacherous villain!

519
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,150
Let go of my master!

520
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,910
Then I'll just kill you.

521
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,880
Master! Master!

522
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,480
Ning Yan!

523
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,700
You're back.

524
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,710
Where is Sect Leader Zi Yang?

525
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,660
The Sect Leader was killed by him.

526
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,300
Suguan!

527
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,290
No!

528
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,140
What?

529
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,620
You know you've done something shameful,

530
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,970
so you want to silence me?

531
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,150
Give it back to me.

532
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,530
Using the magical artifact I created
against me.

533
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,200
Should I call you stupid

534
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,860
or foolish?

535
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,450
Face the consequences of betraying me.

536
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,690
Suguan!

537
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,030
Xiao Jingshan.

538
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,710
You're not so smart either.

539
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,010
You were still fooled by me.

540
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,980
Bai Jiusi.

541
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,780
How is it?

542
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,670
Does it hurt here?

543
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,260
Bai Jiusi.

544
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,960
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

545
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,940
Tell me if you feel unwell.

546
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,260
You've returned to normal?

547
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,540
Ruyue.

548
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,480
You gave me the Life-Protecting Pearl.

549
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,210
I was forced by circumstances.

550
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,030
I didn't know
this would make you return to normal.

551
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,800
You were just wounded
by the Hanlin Dagger.

552
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,060
You can't mobilize your spiritual energy
at will anymore.

553
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,110
This is a Yin-Yang formation.

554
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,180
It uses you and me as the formation's eyes

555
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,950
to make us restrain each other.

556
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,250
When Yin prospers, Yang declines,

557
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,620
and vice versa.

558
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,000
Is there a way to break it?

559
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,400
There is.

560
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,890
How?

561
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,380
Kill me.
