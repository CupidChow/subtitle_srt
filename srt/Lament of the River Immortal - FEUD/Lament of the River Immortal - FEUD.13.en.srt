00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,920
These greens are super fresh too.

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,160
-Look at the leaves.
-They do look fresh.

How is that possible?

11
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400
I saw it with my own eyes that day.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
His leg was broken.

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,560
What kind of method
could heal a broken leg

20

she must've used some dark arts.

altering a mortal's fate with magic

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,360
Sir, what should we do now?

369
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,400
What else can we do?
Put out an arrest warrant!

370
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,600
Bring Meng Changqin back to me!

371
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,410
[Order]

372
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,010
[Bai Jiusi]

373
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,290
[Bai Jiusi]

374
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,970
I went out to take care of something.

375
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,370
Don't look for me.
I'll be back in a few days.

376
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,280
This is...

377
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,410
Are you an immortal?

378
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
Or a demon?

379
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
You just mentioned my grandfather.

380
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,380
Do you know him?

381
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
What's your relationship with him?

382
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
You're not my grandmother, are you?

383
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,430
I've never met her.

384
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,400
I only heard my grandfather say

385
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,760
she was a gentle beauty.

386
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,760
You kinda match the description.

387
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,560
Are you okay?

388
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,060
Using magic to rewrite a mortal's fate

389
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,670
comes with consequences.

390
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,739
Where are you going?

391
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,420
None of your business.

392
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,739
Then where should I go?

393
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,320
That's none of my concern.

394
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,679
I'm a wanted man now.

395
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,320
Just do me another favor

396
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
and point me in the right direction.

397
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,370
Are you okay?

398
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,350
Told you to take me with you,

399
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,570
but you refused.

400
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,800
See? If it weren't for me,

401
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,480
you'd have been torn apart by wild dogs.

402
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,460
But no need to thank me.

403
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,670
You saved my life,

404
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,510
and I saved yours.

405
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,700
We're even now.

406
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,250
We don't owe each other anything anymore.

407
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,620
Smells amazing.

408
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,900
I'm telling you,

409
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,970
my roast rabbit is next-level.

410
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,040
I learned it young
while wandering mountains.

411
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,190
After you eat it,

412
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,770
you have to take me with you.

413
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,960
So noisy.

414
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,680
Better than being boring
and silent like you.

415
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,320
Here.

416
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,510
I'll pass.

417
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,050
Just take it.

418
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,040
As an enlightened one, don't act

419
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,550
all shy and coy.

420
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,120
What did you do?

421
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,720
I didn't do anything.

422
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,520
Then why were they going to execute you?

423
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,910
Because I'm upright
and selfless, that's why.

424
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,940
What's wrong with an official
being upright and selfless?

425
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,830
I'm not wrong.

426
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,640
The problem is this rotten,

427
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,070
chaotic bureaucracy.

428
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,130
I refused to be corrupted like them,

429
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,220
so they framed me.

430
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,080
The officials in that mess of a system

431
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,410
spend all day scheming and backstabbing.

432
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,880
How boring.

433
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,150
I planned to quit anyway.

434
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,620
I'll start cultivation with you.

435
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,280
Once I become an immortal,

436
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,320
I'll go straight back to Huai'an County

437
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,100
to beat those crooked officials
into a pulp.

438
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,160
Then I'll point at…

439
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,760
I'll point right at the emperor's nose

440
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,160
and call him a blind fool.

441
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,520
He couldn't even recognize my talent.

442
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,160
No wonder he's getting manipulated

443
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,340
by a bunch of schemers.

444
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:29,940
Bah!

445
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,080
What?

446
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,640
Do you also think
I'm exceptionally talented

447
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,780
and brilliantly gifted?

448
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,510
Wanna take me as your disciple?

449
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,910
I just think

450
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,720
you're nothing like your grandfather.

451
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,780
Of course not.
My grandfather was never this handsome.

452
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,800
This is the money
I prepared for my burial.

453
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,240
Once the city gates open tomorrow,

454
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,640
I'll treat you to a feast.

455
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,320
After that, I'm officially your disciple.

456
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,840
You've already
prepared money for your burial?

457
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,560
Of course.

458
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,560
When I joined the county office,

459
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,190
I brought a coffin with me

460
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,120
to show I'd never bow to those in power.

461
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,570
It's just politics,

462
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,520
but you make it sound worse than hell.

463
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,660
You don't understand.

464
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,850
Once people get caught up
in power and status,

465
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,040
they can be way worse
than any hell you can imagine.

466
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,900
How about I tell you the wild story

467
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,500
of what I went through back then?

468
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,360
Boring.

469
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,190
Boring.

470
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,000
Everyone, may I have your attention?

471
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,200
Do you know what caused the drought
thousands of miles away

472
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,550
in the north?

473
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,210
What caused it?

474
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,300
Yeah.

475
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,430
What caused it?

476
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,730
The Drought Dragon in the north!

477
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,890
The Drought Dragon?

478
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,610
It was the mount of Nüba.

479
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,240
Back then, it was sealed with Nüba

480
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,600
north of the Chishui River
by the Yellow Emperor.

481
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,290
But now it has escaped.

482
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,080
Wherever it goes,
the land for miles around

483
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,810
is left cracked and parched.

484
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,080
Springs dry up,
and not a single crop grows.

485
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
After all this talk,

486
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,460
what can you actually do about it?

487
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,290
Yeah, do you have any solution?

488
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,480
Of course.

489
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,620
There's only one thing in this world
that can slay the Drought Dragon.

490
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,470
What is it?

491
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,060
It's this Xuanze Saber.

492
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,800
Forged from the shell
of the ancient divine beast,

493
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,320
the Xuan Tortoise,

494
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,720
tempered by storm winds
and soul-freezing ice,

495
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,840
this saber
can summon wind and rain when drawn.

496
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,480
It can surely kill the dragon.

497
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,200
It's so powerful!

498
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,320
If it's so powerful,

499
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,880
why don't you go kill the dragon yourself?

500
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,140
The sword has a spirit.

501
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,800
It chooses its own master.

502
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,690
Only someone really powerful
can control it.

503
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,360
I'm just a normal Daoist,

504
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,480
not nearly powerful enough to wield it.

505
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,000
You just made that up, didn't you?

506
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,240
You're just lying.

507
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,880
Instead of listening to his nonsense,

508
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,880
we'd be better off
praying to the Dragon King.

509
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,960
Wait, let me explain…

510
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,400
Wait.

511
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,250
Let's go.

512
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,480
Wait, wait.

513
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,430
Sir, sir.

514
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:39,920
Sir.

515
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,480
Sir.

516
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,920
What?

517
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,610
You and I must be fated to meet.

518
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,210
I charge others 700 coppers,

519
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,360
but for you, just 500. What do you think?

520
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,200
-No.
-Hold on.

521
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,470
300 coppers. This is below cost.

522
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,040
300?

523
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,480
What do you think?

524
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,000
Still no.

525
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,480
Come on.

526
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,460
Sir, sir.

527
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,860
[For Sale]

528
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:13,260
[For Sale]

529
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,320
Stop, stop.

530
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,350
Stop.

531
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,570
You're for sale?

532
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,030
I'm Zhu.

533
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
I can cook, raise livestock,

534
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,600
and do needlework.

535
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,130
I can help clean your house.

536
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,970
All I ask is two sacks of millet.

537
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,900
You're not young anymore.

538
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,260
You're not worth much.

539
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,880
But this one here…

540
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,620
M-My daughter is not for sale.

541
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,790
Only myself.

542
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,750
I told you, you're worthless.

543
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,340
No one would trade
even a sack of rice for you.

544
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,320
But your daughter looks great.

545
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,820
She's cute and pretty.

546
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,940
She could fetch two sacks of rice.

547
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,040
Sir, I don't sell my children.

548
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,280
Please, spare her.

549
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,080
I said I want her, and I will have her!

550
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,480
Come with me!

551
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,840
-Sir!
-You bad guy! Go away!

552
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,400
Let go of me!

553
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,720
Sir, please let her go!

554
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,450
Sir.

555
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,360
Sir.

556
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
You dare bite me?

557
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,640
Sir.

558
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,120
Not taking the easy way out, huh?

559
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,000
Help!

560
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,120
-Sir.
-I'm not leaving.

561
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,800
-Please let her go.
-Guards!

562
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,180
Get this little girl onto the carriage!

563
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,760
Let me go!

564
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,240
I'll make sure
you don't get a single grain of rice!

565
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,080
Sir!

566
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,420
Take this!

567
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,290
You scum, I'll beat you to death!

568
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,160
Why are you so useless?

569
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,380
Go get him!

570
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,740
What are you waiting for? Go beat him!

571
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,990
Beat…
