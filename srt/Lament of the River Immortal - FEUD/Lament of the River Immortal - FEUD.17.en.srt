[Episode 17]

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,970
Are you not happy

4
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,990
that I'm feeding you?

5
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm too disgusted to eat.

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,370
There's no problem.

7
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,870
If you ask me,

8
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,310
Mrs. Bai must be feeling shy.

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,329
She's probably secretly happy right now.

10
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,840
Bai, trust me.

11
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,520
Just keep going like this,

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,720
and Mrs. Bai will surely be moved
by your thoughtfulness.

13
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,120
Bai.

14
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,760
Bai, don't be impatient.

15
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,620
I haven't finished speaking yet.

16
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
Didn't I tell you to
come to me every month

17
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,840
to ask for the antidote?

18
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,310
Why did you delay for so long?

19
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,270
If you die,

20
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,960
Mr. Meng will be angry with me.

21
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
I was delayed by some matters,

22
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
so I'm only coming for the antidote now.

23
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,680
I can give you the medicine,

24
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,810
but don't forget what you promised me.

[Savage]

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,710
Senior Meng has already been released.

27
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,310
You can go find him yourself.

28
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,470
Would that old-fashioned Zi Yang

29
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,960
really release Mr. Meng?

30
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
You might as well say

31
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,470
that the rats of Jingyun Sect dug a tunnel

32
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,360
for Mr. Meng to escape on his own.

33
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,000
You'll see for yourself when you go there.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,860
The Sect Leader doesn't intend
to stop you anymore.

35
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,030
What nonsense are you talking about?

36
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,150
That old-fashioned Zi Yang

37
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,910
always goes on about good
and evil not coexisting.

38
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,770
How could he possibly not stop us?

39
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,150
Could it be that you're lying to trick me
into going to Jingyun Sect,

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,480
and then kill me?

41
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,430
You helped me ascend before.

42
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,160
I have no reason to deceive you.

43
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,560
Give me the antidote.

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
I have important matters
to attend to next.

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,950
I don't have the leisure

46
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,630
to come find you
once a month for the antidote.

47
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,290
I don't believe you, unless you accompany
me back to Jingyun Sect.

48
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,190
I want to see with my own eyes
that Mr. Meng is safe.

49
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,320
Only then will I give you the antidote.

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,850
I don't have time to accompany you.

51
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,630
If you don't give me the antidote

52
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,230
and something happens to me,

53
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,610
see how Senior Meng will treat you.

54
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,610
Stop right there.

55
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,830
Fine, I'll give you the antidote, okay?

56
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,080
Why are you following me?

57
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,120
I didn't expect that you, a mere mortal,

58
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,970
could go to such lengths
for the Divine Lord.

59
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,430
It's truly surprising.

60
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,360
What do you want to do?

61
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,650
And what do you want to do
after leaving Jingyun Sect?

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,530
I guess you'll go
find the Divine Lord, right?

63
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,800
You didn't listen to

64
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,460
what I said last time, did you?

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,530
Do you really think
the Divine Lord needs you?

66
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,640
Whether she needs me or not
is her business.

67
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,710
Whether I look for her or not
is my business.

68
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,830
If that's the case, count me in.

69

Don't look at me like that.

No buts.

If a man doesn't even know
to take the initiative to find you,

to make Mrs. Bai angry
for two whole months?

I will never forget your kindness.

Mr. Kong has been taking
the imperial exam for over 30 years.

130
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,480
His savings have long been exhausted,

131
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,000
so he usually has a very tight budget.

132
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,510
I told Mr. Kong

133
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,920
you and I will cover
the expenses for his trip

134
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,450

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,720
After he passes the exam,

136
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
he can pay us back.

137
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,400
Don't worry, Bai.

138
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,570
I've covered your share of the money too.

139
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,100
Consider it a favor from me.

140
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,330
Why give me this favor?

141
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,090
Mr. Kong's family is very poor.

142
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,620
He's usually struggling to make ends meet.

143
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,000
The fact that he spent money
to treat us to noodles this time

144
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,200
is enough to prove his affection for us.

145
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,680
I was worried

146
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,320
that he would feel sad and upset

147
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
because you didn't eat his noodles,

148
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,560

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,600
So troublesome. I don't need it.

My wife was thinking of inviting her over.

160

I hope it's not too presumptuous.

161
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,050
Why don't you let your wife

with my wife?

They say close neighbors are
better than distant relatives.

165

Plus, our two families live so close.

166
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,760
We should visit each other more often.

167
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,750
If your wife cheers up,

168
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,870
she might stop being angry with you.

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,080
You've eaten more of my baked flatbreads

186
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,750
than I've even sold.

187
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,270
Quick, quick, come here.

188
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,200
Here, eat this.

189
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,750
Old sir.

190
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,390
Gentlemen.

191
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Give me four...

192
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,930
Give me eight flatbreads.

193
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,480
Alright.

194
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,610
Alright, alright.

195
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,790
Alright, alright.

196
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,080
Here, here, take these.

197
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,790
Hold them carefully.

198
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,390
Thank you.

199
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,730
You take it too.

200
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,360
Why are your hands so cold?

201
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,790
Don't think you can handle the cold
just because you're young.

202
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,240
You'll suffer when you're older.

203
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,480
Wear more clothes when you go out.

204
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
These are still warm.

205
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,690
Warm up your hands.

206
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,910
Warm them up.

207
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,720
Here, old sir.

208
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,110
Alright, alright.

209
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,580
Thank you, thank you both.

210
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,550
Goldie.

211
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,880
Hurry up and go, Goldie.

212
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,640
Don't block the way here.

213
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,720
Alright, Bai.

214
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,630
So, we've agreed on this, right?

215
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,020
I'll take my leave.

216
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:52,960
Lin.

217
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,440
I'll pay the money for
Scholar Kong to take

218
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,460
the imperial exam in the capital with you.

219
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,770
I knew you were a man of honor, Bai.

220
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
You're just not good with words.

221
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,530
I'll be going then.

222
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,609
I brought you some flatbreads.

223
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
I'll go inside first.

224
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,290
I didn't expect you'd be
willing to help mortals.

225
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,510
After all these days,

226
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,410
this is the first time you've
voluntarily spoken to me.

227
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
Why did you do this?

228
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,880
As you said,

229
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,350
I'm living like a mortal.

230
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,620
I'm doing what mortals do,

231
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,480
and I haven't used any power.

232
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,310
I'm not talking about power.

233
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,460
Then what do you want to say?

234
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,280
You still don't understand.

235
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,610
Don't understand?

236
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,110
Mrs. Bai, are you ready?

237
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,890
Ready for what?

238
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,310
Going to my humble abode
for embroidery!

239
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,350
Mr. Bai said you also enjoy needlework

240
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,440
and made plans with my husband

241
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,100
to visit my humble home today.

242
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,330
I couldn't wait, so I came over first.

243
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,180
Did I disturb you two?

244
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,870
Not at all.

245
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,350
I couldn't find suitable silk cloth.

246
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,230
I was delayed.

247
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,680
No need to look. I have
plenty of silk cloth at home.

248
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm overwhelmed by the choices.

249
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,030
It's perfect that you're coming.

250
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,290
You can help me choose.

251
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,590
Mr. Bai, no need to buy dinner
from the restaurant tonight.

252
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,270
My husband has prepared plenty of food.

253
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,750
Let's eat together tonight.

254
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,880
Let's eat together!

255
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,130
Sounds good.

256
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,790
Let's go.

257
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,920
Bai, look.

258
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,880
These are all the books I've collected.

259
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
And some ancient paintings.

260
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,040
This one.

261
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,000
This is "Cranes and Bamboo"

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
by master painter Yuan Danqiu.

263
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,030
When I first arrived in Songhe County,

264
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,960
I discovered this painting

265
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,030
seemed to have a special connection
with this county.

266
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,710
So I spent a lot of money

267
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,800
at a pawn shop

268
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,240
and bought it at a high price.

269
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Look at this painting hanging here.

270
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,030
Doesn't it match this room perfectly?

271
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,080
Feel free to look around.

272
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,960
Here.

273
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,150
Bring it over.

274
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,750
Like this.

275
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,640
You're looking at this?

276
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,400
You think this is quite good too,
don't you?

277
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,790
I happened to read this phrase

278
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,270
in an ancient book.

279
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,240
The ancients often said,

280
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,440
every word and character has its power.

281
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,590
When I read this line of poetry,

282
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,750
I finally felt

283
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
that reading excellent poetry

284
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
can truly inspire one's spirit.

285
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,220
What do you think, Bai?

286
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,070
"Strategies from Ancient History"?

287
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,330
You like this book too?

288
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,810
I really like this one.

289
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,110
It seems we're like-minded.

290
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,480
Lin,

291
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,570
you must be thirsty after talking so much.

292
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,760
How about...

293
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,020
Let's go. This way.

294
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,110
Bai, let me tell you,

295
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,720
my family has served as officials
for generations.

296
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,550
But most of them became court historians
in the capital,

297
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,110
writing and engraving books.

298
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,680
Later, my grandfather faced
setbacks in his career,

299
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,400
so he left behind a family precept,

300
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,460
forbidding his descendants
from becoming officials.

301
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,240
So my father started a business

302
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,310
and became a merchant.

303
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,630
Later, he discovered he had
a natural talent for business.

304
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,560
He made a fortune

305
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,440
and started supporting my education.

306
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,220
It's a pity. I studied
very diligently back then.

307
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,750
I was so intelligent.

308
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,830
My father told me

309
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,590
if I could take the imperial examination,

310
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,070
I would surely come out on top.

311
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,130
I could even become a prime minister.

312
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,680
But I don't think so.

313
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,960
I think studying is just studying.

314
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
What does studying have to do
with being an official?

315
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,510
Being a good student doesn't mean

316
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,970
you'll be a good official.

317
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,880
Instead, one must have a sense of justice

318
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
to be a good official.

319
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,310
Bai, what do you think?

320
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,870
That makes perfect sense.

321
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,360
That's right.

322
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,790
Bai, you truly are my kindred spirit.

323
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,530
Come, Bai.

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,550
Try this.

325
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,750
This is the Zhaoyan tea.

326
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,880
Although this isn't that precious,

327
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,510
there are high requirements
for the water used to brew it.

328
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,000
It must be brewed with morning dew.

329
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,830
Every morning, I go to
the back of the mountain

330
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,920
and collect this dew from

331
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,580
the banyan tree's south side.

332
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,110
You'll find that this tea

333
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,640
is very clean and clear.

334
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,790
And when you smell it,

335
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,790
there's a strong grassy fragrance.

336
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,400
Bai, how do you find it?

337
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,110
Bai, how do you find it?

338
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,520
It's quite good.

339
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,640
Bai,

340
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,920
we are both scholars,

341
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,180
but we can't just focus on
studying with our minds.

342
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,400
We also need to diligently
exercise our bodies.

343
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,460
As the ancients say, study at midnight
and rise at dawn.

344
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,880
That's exactly what I do.

345
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,160
I wake up at midnight to study

346
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,030
and at dawn, I go to the back mountain.

347
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,900
This way, not only can I
collect morning dew,

348
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,230
but I can also exercise.

349
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,530
It's killing two birds with one stone.

350
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,410
That's excellent.

351
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,620
Excellent.

352
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,790
You think it's good too, don't you?

353
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,650
In that case, come with me
to the mountain tomorrow.

354
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,560
I said, come with me
to the mountain tomorrow.

355
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,450
That's really not necessary.

356
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,890
Bai, I see that you're quite thin.

357
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,440
If you come with me
to the mountain every day,

358
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,640
your body will surely become stronger.

359
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,450
People say women are like vines,

360
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,070
and men should be like rocks.

361
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,440
Women have always liked

362
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,370
men who can make them feel secure.

363
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
If you bulk up a bit,

364
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
perhaps your wife

365
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,450
won't look so stern every day.

366
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
This tea is quite potent.

367
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,500
-I'm drunk.
-Dear.

368
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,510
Dear, look.

369
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,130
Mrs. Bai's embroidery is really good.

370
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,560
I thought

371
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,880
my wife's skills were already quite good,

372
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,160
but I didn't expect your wife's
to be even better.

373
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,680
It seems Bai wasn't exaggerating.

374
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,010
Your wife is truly skilled in needlework.

375
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,910
Look, isn't it adorable?

376
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,920
Did you embroider this?

377
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,770
I just did it casually.

378
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,690
When did you learn to
embroider these things?

379
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,680
Mrs. Bai, I have a presumptuous request.

380
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,510
Please, go ahead.

381
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,110
My wife really likes
this little tiger hat.

382
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,510
I wonder if you could give it to her?

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
Of course.

384
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,280
But what do you need this for?

385
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,440
I...

386
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,160
I want it for my unborn child.

387
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,110
My wife is already four months pregnant.

388
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,080
We haven't told anyone yet.

389
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes, but today we've shared the news.

390
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,050
It's also to share some joy with everyone.

391
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,820
What did you do?

392
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,650
Your clothes are all wrinkled.

393
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,090
By the time the child is born,

394
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,010
I suppose this peach tree
will be bearing fruit.

395
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,460
Mrs. Bai, do you like eating peaches?

396
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Yes, I do.

397
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,160
It's a pity we can't eat them now.

398
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,890
We have to wait until it blossoms
and bears fruit.

399
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,890
But that's okay.

400
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,350
Once it blossoms and bears fruit,

401
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,810
I'll send some over to you.

402
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,040
You want to each peaches?

403
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,680
Lin.

404
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,280
This peach tree in your yard

405
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,070
must be over 100 years old, right?

406
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,160
I'm not sure.

407
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,960
We've only been living here
for less than a year.

408
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,000
But the previous owner said

409
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,030
their family had lived here
for three generations.

410
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,830
This peach tree was already
here back then.

411
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,590
So maybe it is quite old.

412
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,010
Being an old tree, it should
have a spirit.

413
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,640
It knows when to bloom

414
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,370
and when to bear fruit.

415
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,510
Bai, listen to yourself.

416
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,550
Don't peach trees always bloom in March

417
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,810
and bear fruit in June?

418
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,510
Not necessarily.

419
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
Since someone wants to eat peaches,

420
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,210
it should bloom and bear fruit.

421
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,510
If it can't satisfy one's craving,

422
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,170

461

do some people still try despite the odds?

640

Because they don't accept fate.

641
