[Episode 5]

3
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,870
Do you want to hear stories too?

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,170
Yun!

5
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,110
I am Heavenly Lady.

6
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,780
If you hurt me,

7
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,870
the Canglei Palace won't let you go!

8
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,770
Ning Yan.

9
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,120
Ning Yan, wake up.

10
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,450
Wake up, Ning Yan!

11
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,870
Ning Yan!

12
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,870
Help! Somebody help!

13
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,620
Steward Cang! Heavenly Lord!

14
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,120
Father, what's the matter?

15
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,530
It's windy at night.

16
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,940
To avoid you catching a cold,

17
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,220
I came to bring you another quilt.

18
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,880
Father, you're just worried that
I might go mess with Heavenly Lady, right?

19
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,030
Despite the promise you made to me today,

20
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,370
I still can't rest assured.

21
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,000
Since childhood, you've always got

22
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,680
whatever you wanted.

23
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,610
When you didn't, you just wouldn't quit.

24
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,480
Back then when you were learning
artifact forging in the mortal realm,

25
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,880
you stayed
in the forging workshop that was

26
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,600
scorching hot for 22 hours
without coming out.

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,510
All men in the yard

28
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,680
were no match for you.

29
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,850
I know you are a kind girl
with an understanding

30
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,140
of the bigger picture
and an insight into judgment.

31
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,950
But why

32
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,310
can't you get over this thing
about my master?

33
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,060
Are you done?

34
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,360
Then leave.

35
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,560
Well then,

36
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,410
g-good night.

37
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,230
Shut the doors and windows

38
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,810
and stay warm.

39
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,960
Where is your shadow?

40
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
You used the Shadow Assassination,

41
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,310
didn't you?

42
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,780
Oh, God!

43
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,909
Why do you want to kill me?

44
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,930
At least let me know the reason
before I die!

45
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,800
Behave!

46
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,380
Heavenly Lord.

47
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,190
Why are you here?

48
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,210
I was hunted down by a shadow
and ended up here.

49
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,680
A shadow?

50
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,430
Yes.

51
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,170
It was holding a dagger.

52
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,880
I was attacked by it on the cliff

53
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
and fell off.

54
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,330
Weren't you being hunted?

55
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,010
Why did it corner you here

56
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,580
instead of killing you directly?

57
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,310
I...

58
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,360
I don't know either.

59
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,950
Yue.

60
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,760
How does it feel
to see your old friend?

61
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,040
What old friend?

62
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,789
I thought you were going to play dumb
for a few more days.

63
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,510
Didn't expect you
to quit pretending so soon.

64
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,510
Heavenly Lord, what do you mean?

65
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,520
Luring me to the mortal realm at the cost

66
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,280
of hurting yourself and getting close
to me by all means,

67
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,090
what on earth

68
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,540
are you up to again, Yue?

69
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,180
Do you want to kill me

70
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,760
or seal me once again?

71
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,760
Why

72
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,960
do you hate me so much?

73
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,460
Heavenly Lord, you've never believed

74
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,450
my love for you, right?

75
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,740
She won't be bullied up there, right?

76
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,910
Master.

77
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,840
Remember,

78
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,220
haste makes waste.

79
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,760
Thank you for your instruction, Master.

80
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,460
You're one of
the most talented disciples of our sect.

81
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,800
If only you had a bit more luck.

82
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,540
I never believe in luck.

83
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,840
I only believe in
righteousness and justice.

84
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,510
Give it my all, and I'll have no regrets.

85
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,440
Good.

86
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,240
Given your tenacity,

87
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,860
fate will treat you well.

88
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,720
Do you know that the Chiyang Fruit
is about to come into being?

89
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,650
Chiyang Fruit?

90
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,010
Is the Chiyang Fruit helpful

91
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,960
to my qihai?

92
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,080
Yes, of course.

93
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,670
There's only one Chiyang Fruit
in a hundred years.

94
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,460
Take it, and it can help you

95
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,270
stabilize your foundation.

96
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,090
It'll even be a piece of cake
to form a core and ascend to heaven.

97
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
But once the Chiyang Fruit emerges,

98
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,060
there will surely be
countless forces fighting for it.

99
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,670
Meng Chu remains imprisoned
in the dungeon, unwilling to repent.

100
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,470
As for Suguan,

101
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,030
she's trapped by love, not strong-minded.

102
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,180
I will have Shangguan Riyue
lead the disciples to go for it.

103
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,910
If you want to go as well,

104
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,040
just join them.

105
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,940
Yes, I want to go with them.

106
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,840
Master.

107
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,600
I have a question.

108
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,480
Go ahead.

109
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,200
Who is this Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

110
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,260
Why is our sect so afraid of him?

111
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,510
The Nine Heavens abound with deities

112
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,700
and are made up of

113
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,150
countless divine lands.

114
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,670
The Danxia Land
possessed by Heavenly Lord Dacheng

115
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,550
is of the most significance among them.

116
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,410
Above it is the Empyrean.

117
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,990
What's more,
the Infinite Stele on Danxia Land

118
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,460
also seals the entrance
to the demon realm.

119
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,960
So,

120
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,440
Danxia Land has entrances
to the mortal realm, demon realm,

121
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,030
and divine realm?

122
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,070
That's right.

123
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,870
So Heavenly Lord Dacheng is guarding there

124
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,000
to guarantee the safety and peace

125
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,480
of the Three Realms.

126
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,670
That's why he deserves
all the respect and awe.

127
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,930
Putting the Empyrean deities aside,

128
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,690
is there not a single immortal

129
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,670
in the Nine Heavens

130
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,440
who can challenge him?

131
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,000
How can we let him
do whatever he wants like a dictator?

132
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,700
Years ago, there was an ancient god

133
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,030
named Siling.

134
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,980
She could match Heavenly Lord Dacheng

135
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,020
in either power or cultivation.

136
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,910
She used to live in the Canglei Palace.

137
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,560
Where is she now?

138
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,110
She has fallen and been gone.

139
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,710
300 years ago,

140
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,680
Heavenly Lord Dacheng led his disciples

141
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,550
to launch an attack on the Canglei Palace.

142
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,790
They subdued her mount, White Snake,

143
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,030
and then annihilated Divine Lord Siling.

144
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,550
White Snake being her mount,
Siling being her title,

145
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,510
she seemed to be a woman.

146
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,720
My Lady, you need to take the medicine
to get better.

147
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,580
I've interrogated the disciples
in the Canglei Palace.

148
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,790
No one saw Her Ladyship

149
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,920
being hunted by the shadow last night.

150
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,890
As for Ning Yan in the Yuewu House,

151
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,660
she lost consciousness

152
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,580
during her cultivation last night.

153
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,390
Nothing suspicious was found.

154
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,360
Her Ladyship moved
into the Canglei Palace not long ago.

155
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,240
And we haven't found

156
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,300
anyone holding grudges against her.

157
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,550
No one noticed Her Ladyship being hunted.

158
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,850
This is indeed weird.

159
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,630
How did the assassin

160
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,630
know Ning Yan was cultivating last night

161
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,150
and manage to avoid
all the disciples?

162
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,440
Shadow Assassination
isn't an ordinary technique.

163
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,840
Only a handful of people
in the Canglei Palace can do it.

164
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm still investigating them one by one.

165
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,500
Could it be that
there was no assassination at all?

166
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,480
Maybe Her Ladyship just didn't
want to stay in the Yuewu House,

167
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,960
so she made up this story.

168
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,430
Or...

169
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,910
Or could it be that

170
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,630
Her Ladyship was interested
in the Forbidden Pool of Eternal Frost,

171
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,150
so she used this excuse?

172
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,560
Keep investigating.

173
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,130
Yes, My Lord.

174
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,530
Maybe you should go somewhere to lay low.

175
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,800
Why should I?

176
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,430
If my master finds out that you did it,

177
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,410
I just can't stay
in the Nine Heavens anymore.

178
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,589
You'd better go confess

179
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,400
and apologize to my master.

180
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,640
What if I say no?

181
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Father, you can't stay out of it by giving

182
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,370
your daughter away.

183
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,330
Don't forget—it was all thanks to me
repairing His Lordship's sword

184
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,190
with my artifact-forging skills

185
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,660
that you got the chance
to become his disciple

186
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,270
and ascend to the Nine Heavens.

187
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,900
Well, I...

188
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,640
Hey.

189
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,890
I'm trying to help you!

190
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,300
I'm not as stupid as you think.

191
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,790
You know what's locked up

192
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,050
in the Forbidden Pool.

193
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,860
Now His Lordship has his mind
all set on it

194
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,790
with no spare time to investigate

195
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,650
whose shadow attempted
to assassinate Li Qingyue.

196
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,330
My Lady, you're awake.

197
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,860
Come on.

198
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,400
This medicine did work wonders.

199
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,860
My efforts in decocting it
with Jianmu branches just paid off.

200
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,240
Oh, right!

201
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,990
Drink it while it's hot.

202
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,040
It won't work if it gets cold.

203
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,980
The medicine is really bitter.

204
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,150
My Lady, you're severely injured.

205
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,610
You can't be picky about the medicine.

206
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,940
Did Heavenly Lord drop by?

207
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,360
No.

208
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,830
His Lordship is busy investigating

209
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,690
the culprit who hurt you, My Lady.

210
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,870
Yes, he's always busy.

211
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
My Lady, how about I go invite
His Lordship over?

212
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,960
Ning Yan,

213
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,240
I think Heavenly Lord has never liked me.
Don't you think so?

214
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,760
How come?

215
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,310
If His Lordship didn't like you, My Lady,

216
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,570
why would he marry you?

217
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,960
Yeah,

218
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,950
why did he marry me?

219
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,560
Ning Yan.

220
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,510
What's that White Snake
in the Pool of Eternal Frost?

221
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,790
White Snake? What is that?

222
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,600
I saw a gigantic white snake

223
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,780
sealed in the Pool of Eternal Frost
after I fell into it.

224
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,350
That Pool is a forbidden land
in the Canglei Palace.

225
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,280
Except for His Lordship,
no one dares to approach it.

226
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,310
Besides, I've only been
in the Canglei Palace

227
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,570
for just a few decades.

228
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,940
I've never heard about that White Snake.

229
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,930
A forbidden land?

230
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,210
My Lord, the seal
of the Hell Ruins loosened again.

231
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,860
Bai Jiusi, long time no see.

232
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,380
So you're still alive
after all these years.

233
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,320
Did you kill Siling?

234
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,880
In the end,

235
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,510
men are more ruthless.

236
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,610
Look at this rosy evening glow.

237
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,940
It's the direction of the Hell Ruins.

238
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,110
Guess a demonic beast
is asking for trouble again.

239
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,490
What are you doing here?

240
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,460
Under His Lordship's order,

241
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,110
we're here to guard the yard gate.

242
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,440
What do you mean?

243
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,940
How can you not let Her Ladyship out?

244
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,750
By His Lordship's order,

245
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,680
you can't leave the Yuewu House
before we finish investigating

246
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,410
your trespassing
on the Forbidden Pool, My Lady.

247
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,620
So he still doesn't trust me.

248
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,440
My Lady.

249
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,520
Let's go back.

250
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,160
Are you hungry, My Lady?

251
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,620
Would you like some fruit?

252
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,210
Can you teach me magic?

253
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,300
Me?

254
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,250
I want to be as mighty as you.

255
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,480
Then I can do more than just flee

256
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,750
when someone attacks me.

257
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,610
But didn't His Lordship
already start to teach you?

258
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,160
He said I was trying
to get close to him by all means.

259
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,560
So I don't want to go
pester him all the time.

260
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,470
Don't worry, My Lady.

261
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,150
I'll teach you.

262
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,070
Look carefully, My Lady.

263
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,230
The first move is to calm down.

264
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,230
Calm down.

265
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,240
Then take root under your feet.

266
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,180
Take root under my feet.

267
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,070
Take root?

268
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,890
Yeah, that's the key to magic.

269
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,470
Without roots, how can you absorb
the energy of the earth?

270
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,790
You've got a point.

271
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,370
But I can't take root even if I want to.

272
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,270
Indeed.

273
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,990
How about I dig a pit for you to stand in?

274
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,990
Good idea.

275
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,650
Calm down.

276
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,190
Take root under my feet.

277
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,680
What?

278
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,790
They're like a crazy

279
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,260
master-disciple duo.

280
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,960
Aren't they afraid that
an unsuitable technique

281
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,220
might backfire badly?

282
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,170
Bai Jiusi, why did you catch me
and bring me here?

283
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,390
I heard that you've been

284
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,870
visiting the Yuewu House a lot lately.

285
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,170
So what?

286
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,380
Ouch!

287
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,350
You locked me up in the Canglei Palace.

288
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,200
What's wrong with me wandering around?

289
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Were you in the Yuewu House two days ago?

290
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,640
Yes.

291
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,920
Did you see anything?

292
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,150
I saw everything.

293
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,960
Tell me.

294
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,790
No.

295
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,950
You want me to tell you.

296
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,090
What can you give me in return?

297
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,770
What do you want?

298
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,000
I want you to free me.

299
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,200
Okay.

300
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,100
Really?

301
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,460
I'm a man of my word.

302
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Listen.

303
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,330
The other day, I saw a black shadow

304
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,030
holding a dagger,

305
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,030
sneaking into Li Qingyue's room
in the dead of night.

306
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,520
Bai Jiusi.

307
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,540
Farewell.

308
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,420
W-What do you mean?

309
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,450
I said I'd free you, but I didn't

310
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,110
promise not to catch you again.

311
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,770
I already let you out just now.

312
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,020
Get back there now.

313
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,410
Bai Jiusi, you...

314
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,830
Bai Jiusi, what are you doing?

315
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,350
Shame on you!

316
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,200
Bai Jiusi!

317
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,350
My Lord, has your spiritual energy
been impaired?

318
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,590
Yesterday in the Hell Ruins,
I found your magic less powerful

319
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,440
than before.

320
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,520
Are you implying that I'm weak?

321
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,290
I need you to do something.

322
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,920
Yes.

323
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,660
My Lady, you're awake.

324
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,530
What's up?

325
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,310
Go out to take a look.

326
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,110
Put it over there.

327
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,750
Yes.

328
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,820
Look, My Lady!

329
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,950
There are more items outside.

330
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,210
Hurry and move them in.

331
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,840
Go.

332
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

333
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,110
Where are these craftsmen from?

334
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,460
They look so familiar.

335
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,780
There are no craftsmen
in the Canglei Palace.

336
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,510
I borrowed

337
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,310
this crew from Fan Jiaojiao.

338
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,740
Lord Fan?

339
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,050
Why did you get them here?

340
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,590
I had no choice.

341
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,200
Given the Canglei Palace's
lack of craftsmen,

342
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
only they know how to nail.

343
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,940
His Lordship ordered

344
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,360
to build a kitchen for you, My Lady.

345
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,070
If you need anything for the kitchen
in the future, My Lady,

346
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,800
I'll have someone send it here.

347
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,030
A kitchen for me?

348
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,880
Yes.

349
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,550
Didn't you mention that
you wanted a kitchen?

350
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,750
His Lordship's been thinking about it.

351
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,040
His Lordship really
cares about you, My Lady.

352
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,310
Where are the Gate-guarding General
and the Gate-guarding Marshal?

353
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,440
His Lordship had them
continue to guard the palace gate.

354
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,670
So Heavenly Lord realized that
he got me wrong?

355
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,250
I'm not sure.

356
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,050
How about you go
ask him yourself, My Lady?

357
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,720
Does he think I'll forgive him

358
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,690
after receiving a kitchen?

359
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,850
I don't care at all.

360
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,540
My Lord, Her Ladyship seems
to still be sulking.

361
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,970
Her Ladyship just recovered.

362
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,460
Would you like to pay her a visit?

363
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,270
No need.

364
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,720
Don't sit.

365
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,090
This is my seat.

366
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,300
Sorry, I didn't see you.

367
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,980
Gazing at the starry sky every night,

368
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,470
don't you get tired of it?

369
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,440
This is mine.

370
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,970
I know it's yours. I won't grab it.

371
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,240
My mind is all over the place.

372
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,640
I need someone to talk to.

373
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,090
Where are you from?

374
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,680
Where are your parents?

375
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,010
Is your whole family
so good at telling stories?

376
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,840
Did you have a crush on someone?

377
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,400
Would she hit you?

378
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,950
Like this.

379
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,240
Strangles you.

380
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,790
Doesn't trust you

381
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,110
and even suspects that
you are up to no good.

382
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,110
Would you get mad?

383
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,750
What a noisy chatterbox.

384
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,240
Well, tell me a story then.

385
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,280
Are you sure?

386
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,360
Go ahead.

387
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,400
Once upon a time, a girl married someone

388
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,470
from the Canglei Palace.

389
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,440
But her husband left her

390
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,960
alone on some remote

391
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,240
mountain peak.

392
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,920
She went through trials and tribulations

393
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,270
to find her husband.

394
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,830
But she was thrown

395
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,330
into a remote courtyard again.

396
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,830
No matter how hard

397
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,230
that girl tried to get close
to her husband,

398
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,840
her husband

399
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,000
remained aloof and distant toward her.

400
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,440
Later, the girl was
hunted down by someone

401
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,020
and almost died.

402
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,570
Her husband not only showed no concern

403
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,110
but also thought she was making it up.

404
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,270
Then the girl started to doubt

405
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,360
her husband's love for her.

406
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,030
She thought that
her husband had never loved her.

407
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,020
But she didn't know that

408
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,580
her husband often came back
to see her in secret.

409
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,090
Her husband had
complicated feelings for her,

410
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,260
like love and hatred,

411
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,590
but there was never abhorrence.

412
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,590
What do you want?

413
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,990
So

414
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,030
he still loves his wife,

415
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,720
right?

416
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
That's deep love.

417
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,680
But now I'm

418
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,200
going to tell a story about him.

419
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,190
It's about counting heads.

420
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,740
One.

421
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,400
Two.

422
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,710
I don't want to hear it.

423
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,550
Li Qingyue!

424
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,780
You are as shameless as Bai Jiusi.

425
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,330
You even lied to a child.

426
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,000
My Lady, is this the scrumptious
kitchen aroma you mentioned?

427
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,719
No.

428
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,800
I haven't cooked in a while.
I'm a bit rusty on it.

429
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,929
Put out the fire now.

430
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,940

00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,429

My Lord, your Primordial Yin Water

hard to suppress each other.

Yet Siling's Primordial Yang Flame

477

But with fewer and fewer people
getting married,

482
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,800
we can absorb little energy now.

483
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,360
Master,

484
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,480
how about you and your wife
hold an official wedding?

485
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,970
My Lord, Her Ladyship
went to the Linyuan Pavilion for you.

486
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,600
How swiftly he teleported.

487
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,410
Heavenly Lord, you built me a kitchen.

488
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,210
So I made some homestyle dishes

489
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,590
and brought them here for you to try.

490
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,310
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, don't be mad.

491
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,840
How about I make you dinner tonight

492
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,640
as an apology?

493
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,180
You can cook?

494
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,910
This dish is Braised Pork Balls in Gravy.

495
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,110
This is rib broth. This is a lamb shank.

496
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I've boiled the shank
with water and vinegar to get rid

497
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,530
of the muttony odor.

498
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,290
And this.

499
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,820
I didn't even share it
with Ning Yan and the others.

500
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,150
The crab roe is really good.

501
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,940
Give it a try.

502
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,230
Just some ordinary dishes
from the mortal realm.

503
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,160
I wonder if they're to your liking.

504
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,730
Let me help you, Heavenly Lord.

505
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,490
Here you are.

506
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,460
Is it good?

507
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,960
Not bad.

508
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,830
Nice!

509
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,890
You haven't eaten yet?

510
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,280
The food I made

511
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,670
was eaten up by Yin Tongzi and Ning Yan.

512
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,360
I'll go back
and make some more for myself later.

513
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
But I need Steward Cang

514
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,540
to send more ingredients to my place.

515
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,720
Cang Tu is in charge of all the chores
and affairs in the Canglei Palace,

516
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,120
unable to attend
to your needs all the time.

517
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
Sit next to me.

518
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,310
Let's eat together.

519
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,190
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

520
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,700
Why aren't you eating?

521
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,820
I only brought one pair of chopsticks.

522
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,700
It's okay. The spoon works too.

523
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,440
It's fine.

524
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,680
Why are you smiling?

525
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,610
So sweet. The pork balls are delectable.

526
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,560
But it's a salty dish.

527
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,790
How could it be sweet?

528
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,630
Yeah. How could it be sweet?

529
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,910
Zip it and eat.

530
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,670
Though immortals don't need to eat,

531
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,190
if you like it, Heavenly Lord,

532
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,320
I can cook something for you every day.

533
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,630
Okay.

534
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,490
See you tomorrow then.

535
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,810
You really don't remember the White Snake

536
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,590
in the Pool of Eternal Frost?

537
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,570
Why do you ask so?

538
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,770
Just a random question.

539
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,500
It's fine if you don't know it.

540
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,140
It's been trapped in that Pool
for 11 years with its soul

541
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,870
subdued by the golden needles.

542
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,100
It's dying.

543
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,290
Today is its last day.

544
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,650
By noon tomorrow,

545
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,070
the golden needles
will finish refining it.

546
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,780
Its divine bones will vanish.

547
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,840
And you won't be able to find it even if

548
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,040
you search the entire Hell.

549
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,070
A puppet?
