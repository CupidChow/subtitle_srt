[Episode 7]

3
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,390
These are all precious jewelry.

4
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,039
Each piece was personally
designed and commissioned

5
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,700
by the Heavenly Lord himself.

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,070
The materials used are extremely valuable.

7
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,730
There are 108 pieces in total.

8
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,430
My Lady, please see
if the count is correct.

9
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,530
My Lady, aren't you curious

10
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,150
who these accessories are for?

11
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
You didn't invite me here

12
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,500
just to count the items, did you?

13
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,110
I'd like you to listen to a story.

14
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,360
A story?

15
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,620
It's about a devoted man

16
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,390
who fell in love with a woman
he shouldn't have.

17
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,420
That's the Divine Lord Siling.

18
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,950
Doesn't she look a lot like you?

19
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,570
What are you trying to do?

20
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,270
What can I do?

21
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,430
I just want you to see clearly

22
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,900
who you owe

23
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
for your good life in Danxia Land.

24
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,520
When the world was still in chaos,

25
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,250
the Primordial God created
two strands of true energy:

26
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,079
one pure and one turbid,

27
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,690
one yin and one yang,

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,290
one cold and one hot.

29
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,579
They became Heavenly Lord Dacheng
and Divine Lord Siling.

30
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,079
They were born with the universe and
would live as long as the sun and moon.

31
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,750
They had fought for

32
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,050
as long as this world had existed.

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,590
For millions of years in the past,

34
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,150
they fought evenly, with no clear winner.

35
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,030
Unfortunately,

36
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,680
the Heavenly Lord made a mistake
he shouldn't have.

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,890
He fell in love with Siling.

38
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,090
How ridiculous!

39
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,700
He fell in love with his destined enemy.

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,810
The Heavenly Lord joyously
wanted to be with her.

41
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,630
But Siling took the poisoned Hanlin Dagger

42
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,360
and stabbed the Heavenly Lord.

43
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,640
It shattered his heart and meridians.

44
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,600
She took this chance to seal
the Heavenly Lord

45
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,590
and stole all of his power.

46
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,800
After that,

47
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,130
she became the most powerful being
in the Nine Heavens.

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,690
From then on, she conquered and killed,

49
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,290
seizing the artifacts
of many immortal sects,

50
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,720
angering the heavens and the people.

51
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,480
Fortunately, the Heavenly Lord
was blessed.

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,880
Rescued by a kind person,

53
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,100
he was able to break the seal and
return to Danxia Land.

54
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,490
He fought Siling until her
primordial spirit fled.

55
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,360
Since then,

56
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,830
Siling could only live

57
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,430
like a maggot in a gutter,

58
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,659
relying on her remnant soul to hide in
the mortal realm for the rest of her life.

59
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,120
My Lady, after hearing this story,

60
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,440
do you have any questions?

61
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,150
You're trying to sow discord between
me and the Heavenly Lord.

62
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,560
I can't make up a story like this.

63
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,920
My Lady, you can go to Canglei Palace

64
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,590
and ask any elder there.

65
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,390
Then you'll know if it's true or false.

66
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,790
Even if the story is true,

67
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,110
you still told it to sow discord.

68
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,920
The grudge between
the Heavenly Lord and Siling

69
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,870
is a thing of the past.

70
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,400
It has nothing to do with me.

71
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,800
I won't let the past

72
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,520
ruin the present and future.

73
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,770
Then I hope you get what you desire,

74
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,090
always stay clear-headed and rational,

75
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,040
and never fall into confusion or jealousy.

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,830
I have other matters to attend to.

77
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,890
I'll leave this place to you, My Lady.

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,090
Oh, My Lady.

79
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,290
You've found out.

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,300
I had originally planned to keep you
here for a few more days,

81
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,330
but now you're asking for death.

82
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,270
You think I'll let you chase me around

83
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,190
like last time?

84
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,050
Take root!

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,520
Where do you think you're going?

86
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,070
Yun, strike!

87
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,630
Good wine, truly fine.

88
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,130
-Fill it up.
-Thank you.

89
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,630
Please.

90
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,659
Oh, no.

91
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,060
Looks like I've come to the wrong place.

92
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,450
I can't be trapped here.

93
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,700
I need to find a way to get out quickly.

94
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,750
What a sinister place.

95
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,300
Who's there? Who's crying?

96
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,650
Who are you?

97
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,060
This place is so sinister.

98
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,510
Why is a child like you here?

99
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,550
Miss,

100
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,390
did you also get lost and end up here?

101
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,470
Lost?

102
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,320
I was going home with my dad
after chopping wood.

103
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,760
But somehow,

104
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
a thick fog came over the mountains.

105
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,450
When I opened my eyes,
I found myself here.

106
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
And my dad is gone too.

107
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,050
You're from the mortal realm?

108
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,330
My dad often says

109
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,150
that children who don't behave

110
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,000
will be caught by demons
and locked up in the forest,

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,950
then eaten one by one.

112
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,390
Did I get brought here

113
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,790
because I didn't behave?

114
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,480
Don't cry.

115
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,150
This place isn't some demon's lair.

116
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,550
This is Danxia Land.

117
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,550
Heavenly Lord Dacheng is in charge.

118
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,380
This is where immortals reside.

119
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,440
Only those with spiritual roots and
enlightened minds can enter here,

120
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,500
so you're not a disobedient child.

121
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,190
You're a child destined for immortality.

122
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,400
Then are you an immortal too?

123
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,900
Can you take me to find my dad?

124
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,700
Of course I can.

125
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,800
As long as you don't cry,
I'll take you out of here.

126
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,400
Let's go.

127
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,630
Little one, what's your name?

128
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,770
Where do you live?

129
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,270
My name is Fengyou. I live in Yupei
Village on Qinggang Mountain.

130
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,390
My dad's surname is Hong.

131
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,790
He's the most famous
hunter in the village.

132
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,480
Yupei Village?

133
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,320
But I remember

134
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,030
Yupei Village had the same
name as a former emperor,

135
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,030
so it was renamed

136
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,560
Lupei Village decades ago.

137
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,080
Yes, it's Lupei, you're right.

138
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,840
It's just that our village is quite poor

139
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,550
and mostly old people are left.

140
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,120
They're all used to calling
it Yupei Village.

141
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,580
They don't like to change.

142
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,840
Is that so?

143
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,130
Miss...

144
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,200
Lupei Village was a name I just made up.

145
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,630
How long are you going to
keep up this act, demon?

146
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

147
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,790
Miss, you're hurting me.

148
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,380
My cultivation is mediocre,

149
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,790
but I'm competent enough

150
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,210
to know demon from human.

151
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,770
You still won't show your true form, huh?

152
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,840
Yun,

153
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,240
banish evil!

154
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,000
Strike!

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,480
You little brat,
not so easy to fool after all.

156
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,020
Looks like I'll have to get serious.

157
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,290
You smell of Bai Jiusi.

158
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,610
What's your relationship with him?

159
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,070
Are you his servant?

160
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,520
Or his lover?

161
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,110
[Hall of Penance]

162
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,920
Senior Zhang.

163
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,930
I need to see Senior Meng Chu.

164
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:54,190
[Hall of Penance]

165
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,520
Good wine.

166
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,110
What brings you here?

167
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,380
Why is your qihai
injury worse?

168
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,590
What happened?

169
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,930
Senior Meng Chu,

170
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,970
what can I do for you?

171
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,910
For me?

172
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,480
Yes.

173
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,040
You're not the type to meddle
in others' affairs.

174
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,080
What, do you need something from me?

175
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,810
I need to go to the Nine Heavens.

176
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,260
Nine Heavens?

177
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,720
The realm of immortals?

178
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,560
What are you going there for?

179
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,510
Thank you, little girl,

180
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,140
for setting things up for me.

181
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,320
Where do you think you're going?

182
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,220
Fan Jiaojiao, how dare you ruin my plans!

183
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,180
Drop the nails!

184
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,790
Set up the joy formation!

185
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,660
You Nailers

186
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,990
are so noisy!

187
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,480
Yun, it's up to you now.

188
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,970
Immortal Lord Fan, hurry!

189
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,510
Banish evil and malice; let joy
descend from the heavens.

190
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,710
Banish evil and malice; let joy
descend from the heavens.

191
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,950
Banish evil and malice; let joy
descend from the heavens.

192
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,430
Oh no! Oh no!

193
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,850
Something has happened to Her Ladyship!

194
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
What's all the panic about?

195
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,070
Her Ladyship

196
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,260
accidentally went to the Hell Ruins.

197
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,750
Go find Fan Jiaojiao.

198
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,080
The Heavenly Lord is in seclusion
and must not be disturbed.

199
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,500
Heavenly Lord.

200
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,130
What's going on?

201
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,950
I just heard a commotion
from the Hell Ruins.

202
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,230
When I inquired,

203
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,720
I found out it was Her Ladyship.

204
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,750
She accidentally entered

205
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,010
the barrier sealing the demonic beasts.

206
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,590
-It’s all Fan Ling'er’s fault.
-She really can’t stay still for a moment.

207
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,640
Fine. Since I can't leave,

208
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,250
you'll have to stay and keep me company.

209
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,930
Immortal Lord Fan, don't mind me.

210
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,000
Carry on.

211
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,300
Little girl, you've got some guts.

212
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,880
Yun, come!

213
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,450
Heavenly Lord?

214
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,050
Your spiritual energy is damaged,

215
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,010
yet you still dare to fight me?

216
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,560
To deal with you,

217
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,480
it is enough.

218
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,420
Bai Jiusi,

219
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,080
you found

220
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,740
the substitute for Siling quite quickly.

221
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,860
My eyes are like mirrors,
seeing through the dust.

222
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,520
Reveal the true evil quickly.

223
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,710
I... I killed her?

224
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,430
That was just a clone.

225
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,580
Master, shall I lead a team to pursue?

226
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,640
No need.

227
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,590
She can run,

228
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,620
but I can catch her again.

229
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,400
Li Qingyue?

230
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,480
Actually, you've seen her before.

231
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,610
All these years,

232
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,460
she has been guarding the
mountain gate with me.

233
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,720
Oh you.

234
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,190
How did you end up falling

235
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,040
for the same person
as Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

236
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,030
My parents passed away early.

237
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,950
At 11, the Sect Leader chose me
to join the sect.

238
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,640
I devoted myself to cultivation,

239
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,310
only wanting to attain immortality
as soon as possible.

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,310
During that time,

or perhaps

270
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,570
I was afraid of being rejected by her.

But what about her? What has she done?

335
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,160
She became the Heavenly Lady

336

337
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,850

I know Ling'er's sins are grave,

339

What do you want to do?

342

She wanted to kill me because of you.

343
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,720
Shouldn't it be up to you to decide?

My Lady, you were in danger twice.

345
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Naturally, it's up to you to decide.

346
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,270
So whatever I say goes?

347

those who commit grave sins

350
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,590
are to be imprisoned in the Land of Ruins,

351
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,910
never to be released.

352
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,550
The Land of Ruins?

353
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,440
How is that any different
from killing Ling'er?

354
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,550
This absolutely cannot be allowed!

355
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,030
Immortal Lord Fan, you can't even
discipline your own daughter.

356
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,240
Stepping forward now,

357
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,850
do you want to bear the punishment

358
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,130
with your daughter?

359
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,070
Send her to the Ruins.

360
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,680
Yes.

361
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,240
You broke into the Hell Ruins at night
where the demonic beasts are kept,

362
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,170
and released the sealed Honglian.

363
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,320
Don't you think you should explain?

364
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,790
Shouldn't you give me
an explanation first?

365
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,190
What do I need to explain?

366
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,720
Is what Fan Ling'er said true?

367
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,340
Did you truly marry me

368
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,880
because my appearance

369
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,280
is identical to that of
Divine Lord Siling?

370
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,170
If what you plan to say
is not what I want to hear,

371
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,340
then don't say anything more.

372
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,220
Sect Leader once said

373
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,610
that there must be some
karmic fate for me,

374
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,340
a mere mortal, to be chosen
by the Heavenly Lord,

375
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,880
I initially thought

376
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,660
that I had some undiscovered talent.

377
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,400
It turns out it's just
because of this face.

378
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,750
Rest assured, Heavenly Lord.

379
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,980
I know my place.

380
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,230
From today on, I will
certainly be obedient

381
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,950
and act well as the Heavenly Lady.

382
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,910
My Lady, are you alright?

383
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,170
Are you hurt anywhere? Is it serious?

384
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,480
Should we call for
a divine healer to take a look?

385
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,270
I've prepared some
purifying spirit water for you.

386
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,310
When you enter a room,

387
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,480
sprinkle a bit on yourself.

388
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,080
This will remove any bad luck

389
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,040
and stay—

390
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Immortal Lord Cang Tu, please wait.

391
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,420
Immortal Lord Cang Tu,

392
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,980
may I have a few words with Ling'er?

393
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,360
Thank you.

394
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,880
The Land of Ruins is so far away.

395
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,970
You really know how to get into trouble.

396
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,410
The Land of Ruins is extremely cold,

397
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,500
while you have a fire-controlling body.

398
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,690
You must be very careful.

399
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,970
Don't let the cold
invade your vital points.

400
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,930
It's good to suffer
a bit early on.

401
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,700
It'll save you from always pursuing things
that don't belong to you

402
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,190
and wasting your time.

403
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,640
The Nine Heavens and Four Seas are vast.

404
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,030
There are all kinds of people out there.

405
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,830
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

406
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,270
My actions

407
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,340
didn't involve you at all.

408
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,380
Why bother putting up this act?

409
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,290
From childhood to now,

410
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,550
you've always cared about
yourself the most.

411
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,910
You only used cheap things to appease me.

412
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,480
Seeing your face now

413
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,960
makes me sick.

414
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,480
Are you angry at me

415
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,740
for not bearing the punishment with you?

416
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,190
Ling'er, you need to understand

417
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,910
that only by staying outside

418
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,000
do I have a chance to plead
with Master for leniency.

419
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,030
There's no need.

420
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,010
You were never there when I needed you.

421
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,550
I don't need a father anymore.

422
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,640
Let's go.

423
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,450
Ling'er...

424
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,270
The Heavenly Lord has ordered

425
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,270
to imprison you in the Land of Ruins,

426
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,830
never to leave.

427
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,430
I've forged swords for
the Heavenly Lord for years.

428
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,830
I never thought

429
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,030
he would treat me like this
for a mere mortal.

430
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,510
The Heavenly Lord spared your life

431
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,310
out of respect for your father.

432
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,520
Otherwise,

433
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,540
you would have already perished
under his sword.

434
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,430
The Land of Ruins
is the source of all cold.

435
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,820
After three to five years,

436
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,450
the cold will invade your body
and you'll lose your cultivation.

437
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,190
By then, even if you could leave,

438
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,070
you would become mortal

439
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,770
and forever suffer from the torment of
cold-related illnesses.

440
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,410
The Ruins is bitterly cold.

441
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,200
Take care, celestial attendant.

442
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,330
Get out!

443
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,690
You have no money,
yet you drink on credit every day.

444
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,850
Leave now and don't come back again.

445
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,590
Didn't she give you money?

446
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What right do you have to
stop me from drinking?

447
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,420
Your wife has been begging us

448
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,159
to not serve you any more alcohol.

449
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,690
Can't you have some self-respect?

450
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,949
That old hag is no fun.

451
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,090
Every time I see her,

452
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,270
[Lanyue House]

453
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,870
she has a miserable look on her face.

454
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,710
It's just helping me
pay back a few copper coins,

455
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,840
and she's either crying or making a scene.

456
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,080
I'm telling you,

457
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,690
when I see her later,

458
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,360
I'll beat her to death!

459
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,070
I can drink anywhere.

460
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,360
I'll just sit outside and drink.

461
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,640
That damn woman.

462
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,040
Beautiful lady.

463
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,150
My lady.

464
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,780
Heavenly Lord,

465
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,230
we've already tracked down
Honglian's whereabouts.

466
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,900
It seems she hasn't been trying
to hide since her escape.

467
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,030
She's currently in Songhe County.

468
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,940
In the coming days,

469
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,770
you'll be in charge of
guarding Canglei Palace.

470
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,070
You've just forcibly ended your seclusion.

471
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,550
Your old illness has worsened.

472
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,440
It's really not advisable for you
to use your power again.

473
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,120
If it's to capture Honglian,

474
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,440
I am willing to go.

475
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,000
Just guard Canglei Palace well.

476

[Yuewu House]

477
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,000
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

478
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,200
Pack your bags.

479
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,700
Are you trying to get rid of me?

480
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,390
You think I really want to stay
in this stupid Canglei Palace?

481
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,650
What are you thinking?

482
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,360
Come with me to catch demons.

483
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,160
Catch demons?

484
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,440
You let Honglian escape from Hell Ruins.

485
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,140
Don't you need to
take responsibility for that?

486
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,810
Where are we going to catch demons then?

487
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,760
You'll know when we get there.

488
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,000
Wait.

489
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,360
I need to change my clothes too.

491
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,100
Where is this?

492
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,730
Don't you know?

493
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,440
Did you just scoff at me?

494
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,580
What do you mean?

495
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,230
[Songhe County]

496
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,070
Could it be that this is where you

497
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,400
and Divine Lord Siling pledged your love?

498
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,990
Are you taking me on a trip
down memory lane?

499
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,790
So what if I am?

500
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,810
You can reminisce on your own.
I won't be joining you.

501
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,060
You won't take responsibility for
the demon you let escape?

502
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,510
[Songhe County]

503
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,960
Mr. Xu, why are you closing up shop too?

504
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,360
The streets aren't safe now.

505

-Stop talking. Go back.
-Safety is priority.

507
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,550
Let's not talk anymore.
We're closing up now.

508

Why are the streets so deserted?

509
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,810
Let's go back quickly.

510
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,760
It seems she has already
started causing trouble.

511
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,560
Are you talking about Honglian?

512
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,860
Go and investigate, and you'll find out.

513
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,320
Thank you.

Excuse me, sir.

Why are there so few people on the streets
in the middle of the day?

A few days ago, someone outside the city
had their heart dug out by a demon.

is in a state of panic.

Yes, a demon that digs out
people's hearts.

526
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,590
It's terrifying just to think about it.

527
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,960
What a coincidence! We are demon hunters.

528
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,510
