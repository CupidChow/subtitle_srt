[FEUD]

2
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,020
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,170
You let me fool you for centuries.

4
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,200
You really are a pair of idiots.

5
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,240
Xiao Jingshan.

6
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
There's no bad blood between us.

7
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,400
Why did you use me like this?

8
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,070
Blame Heavenly Lord Dacheng,
who lives as long as the sun and moon.

9
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,980
Who could ever beat him?

10
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,400
Only you, Divine Lord Siling,

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,680
who share his origin, can kill him.

12
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,590
Unlike you, he isn't soft,

13
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,940
and your softness makes you weak.

14
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,530
You've used my disciple again and again.

15
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,970
It's truly despicable.

16
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,240
Use?

17
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,870
He just showed up at the perfect time.

18
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,610
I'd spent 500 years
secretly learning dark magic.

19
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,600
I didn't need my old magic anymore,

20
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,870
so I gave it to him.

21
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,100
Honestly,

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,720
making him my vessel
isn't that unforgivable.

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,150
He should be thanking me.

24
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,870
He had been a useless nobody,

25
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,600
and I made him a top cultivator.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,470
Whether it was immortal arts
or dark magic,

27
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,830
you mastered them on your own.

28
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,090
There must be a reason.

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
When the Primordial God created the world,

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,370
a wisp of foul air escaped his chest
and drifted into the world.

31
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,940
By some unknown twist of fate,
it ended up possessing you.

32
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
But don't let it cloud your mind.

33
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,760
That twist of fate happened
to ensure my success.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,240
It proves my path is the right one.

35
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,650
Twisting words to justify yourself!

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,700
You're responsible
for my master's death too, aren't you?

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,150
Her?

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,310
What if I insist on
seeing Heavenly Lord Dacheng today?

39
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,460
Then I won't hold back.

40
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,329
Wait.

41
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,520
I-I was just joking.

42
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,500
It's been a long time
since I saw my disciple.

43
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,010
She's missed me too.

44
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,190
I-I'll go now.

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,570
Who are you?

46
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,920
She didn't have to die.

47
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,570
But you were starting
to hesitate about killing Bai Jiusi.

48
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,900
So I had to
give you two a little more hatred

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,070
to work with.

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
You pitted us against each other

51
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,930
just to benefit yourself and destroy

52
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,880
the Infinite Stele, didn't you?

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,830
What do you have against it?

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,400
Too many questions.

55
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,350
I wanted to do it, so I did.

56
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,080
Indeed, no reason is needed.

57
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,530
Your crimes are unforgivable.
You deserve to die.

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,900
What are you doing?

59
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
See for yourself.

60
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,580
This is...

61
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,510
The Life-Link Curse.

62
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,310
The life of the one who casts it

63
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,300
is tied to the one who's cursed.

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,
you're truly knowledgeable.

65
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,730
Divine Lord Siling,

66
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,040
this guy climbed
the Sky-Reaching Ladder for you

67
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,070
and endured the pain
of having his tendons and bones crushed.

68
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,600
Will you really take my life

69
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,200
at the cost of his?

70
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,980
You won't.

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,890
That's your weakness.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,940
First Meng Changqin, now Zhang Suan—

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,909
they both became your soft spots.

74
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,230
Once I'm gone,
the curse will lift on its own.

75
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,850
As for the Infinite Stele,

76
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,560
I'll leave it alone for now.

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,960
It's just a Life-Link Curse.

78
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,750
Since I know what it is, I can break it.

79
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,760
Bai Jiusi,

80
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,760
this curse can only be lifted
by the one who cast it.

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,490
No matter how powerful you are,
you can't undo it.

82
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,740
Begone, evil. Yield!

83
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,960
Now's the time.

84
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,020
Kill him.

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,300
Is the curse broken?

86
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes.

87
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
He's lying to you.

88
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
The Life-Link Curse can't be lifted

89
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,670
unless he's transferred it to himself.

90
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,159
If you kill me,

91
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,659
he'll die too.

92
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,880
Ruyue, haven't you
always wanted to kill me?

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,650
Well,

94
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,460
here's your perfect excuse.

95
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,680
Xiao Jingshan is a threat
as long as he lives.

96
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,140
Do it for the greater good.

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,470
Ruyue, do it.

98
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,480
I'll leave
the Infinite Stele in your care.

99
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,760
You'll surely do better than I did.

100
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,950
Siling,

101
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,240
do you know why Bai Jiusi

102
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,040
sealed your power for ten years?

103
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't try any tricks.

104
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,940
He did it
to take punishment in your place.

105
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,240
What do you mean?

106
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,330
He's stalling. Do it now!

107
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,070
Looks like I have to

108
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,750
explain what happened myself.

109
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,640
You came to the mortal realm
with Siling to gain experience.

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,770
Do you know what she's trying to do now?

111
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,390
She's trying to kill a divine being.

112
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,150
Things form, exist, decay, and vanish.

113
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,490
Karma flows in cycles,
and life never ceases.

114
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,930
That's the law of heaven.

115
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,770
But now she plans to kill
the Drought Dragon.

116
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,950
That's not just deicide.

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,220
It disrupts the natural cycle

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,890
and interferes with the way of heaven.

119
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,690
You descended with her.

120
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,950
You can't just stand by and do nothing.

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,289
What do you want me to do?

122
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,770
Stop her and bring her back
to Empyrean for severe punishment.

123
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,760
You refuse?

124
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
I don't agree with what she's doing,

125
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,140
but I'll never hurt her.

126
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
In that case,

127
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,270
I'll do it myself.

128
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,640
Hua Ruyue, how dare you
try to kill a divine being?

129
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,520
It brought ruin
to the mortal realm, so it has to die!

130
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,490
It's a divine being.
Even if it has sinned,

131
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,050
the way of heaven will punish it—

132
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,620
not you!

133
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,650
What did the way of heaven do
when droughts happened?

134
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,820
What did the way of heaven do
when people starved to death?

135
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,790
If the way of heaven
is as merciless as you make it sound,

136
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,140
then it's not worth obeying!

137
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,370
Both mortals

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,170
and divine beings

139
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,850
must obey the way of heaven!

140
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,960
Master!

141
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,310
Meng Changqin, what are you waiting for?

142
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,140
Do you have a death wish?

143
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,740
No one is allowed to hurt her.

144
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,580
Not the way of heaven.

145
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
And definitely not you!

146
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,170
If you want to leave,

147
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,670
you'll have to step over my dead body.

148
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,680
The Drought Dragon is dead.

149
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,300
You're too late.

150
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,540
She'll pay the price, and so will you.

151
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,860
Once everything's settled,

152
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,420
I'll go to Empyrean
to accept my punishment.

153
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,570
Alright.

154
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,170
Then I'll be waiting for you
at the Heavenly Punishment Platform.

155
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,040
Just you? Where's Siling?

156
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,220
I've sealed her spiritual energy.

157
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,620
She'll remain at Qichi Hall
in the mortal realm,

158
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,090
living as an ordinary person
for ten years.

159
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,260
The mortal realm is full of suffering.

160
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,090
Those ten years

161
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,610
will be punishment enough.

162
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,130
I'll take the rest
of the punishment alone.

163
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,250
The punishment for deicide is severe.

164
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,140
I don't mind.

165
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,240
You just need someone

166
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
to punish, don't you?

167
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,050
Let it be me.

168
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,370
In the first year of Emperor Qi's reign,
Bai Jiusi descended to the mortal realm

169
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,280
and killed the Drought Dragon,
committing deicide

170
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,170
and disrupting the way of heaven.

171
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,600
He was punished
at the Heavenly Punishment Platform—

172
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,080
struck by 99 bolts
of lightning a day for ten full years.

173
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,880
Time flows the same there
as it does in the mortal realm.

174
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,910
You suffered in the mortal realm
for ten years.

175
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,550
He was punished
in the divine realm for ten years.

176
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,450
He had no way of knowing your hardships.

177
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,370
Do it.

178
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,020
Later, I tried
to destroy the Infinite Stele,

179
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,700
violated heavenly law,

180
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,440
and was imprisoned
at the Heavenly Punishment Platform.

181
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,270
That's where I met him,
during his punishment.

182
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,050
We were neighbors for ten years,

183
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,440
and I witnessed the torment he endured.

184
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,280
The lightning punishment was brutal.

185
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,940
He endured it for ten years
without a single cry.

186
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,850
Truly a remarkable man.

187
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,380
That's when I discovered
his only weakness—

188
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,540
you, Siling.

189
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,490
So I spent centuries setting up the trap

190
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,190
to push you into killing him.

191
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,370
He's trying to shake your resolve.

192
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,360
Do it now!

193
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,790
Can you really do it?

194
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,120
Ruyue.

195
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,490
Fine, then I'll kill him myself!

196
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,020
We'll meet again.

197
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,470
Ruyue.

198
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,880
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,530
Once again, I've let you down.

200
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,990
Don't speak. Steady your breath.

201
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,880
You know what?

202
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,750
I was acting in Canglei Palace

203
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,130
earlier today,

204
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,190
but I meant everything I said.

♪ Melancholy takes up half of my life ♪

214
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,640
Master's been seriously injured
for two weeks,

215
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,630
but he's never
gone into seclusion to recover.

216
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,630
Moreover,
his Life-Protecting Pearl is missing,

217
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,480
and just a few days ago,

218
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
his primordial spirit
was somehow severely damaged.

219
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,210
This time, with the backlash
from the formation,

220
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,920
I'm afraid he might not make it.

221
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,610
Why didn't you warn him?

222
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,210
I've warned him countless times,

223
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,990
but Master always had his own plans.

224
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,300
He never had time to rest and recover.

225
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,580
Are you saying

226
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
he might die?

227
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,850
I don't know.

228
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,780
His condition

229
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,830
has reached a point

230
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,720
where even I can't heal him.

231
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,240
His primordial spirit can't be repaired.

232
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,310
Worst of all,

233
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,030
he's lost the will to live.

234
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,910
There's nothing I can do.

235
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,280
Let's not dwell on the past for now.

236
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,000
Divine Lord, you and His Lordship
put on an act together.

237
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,130
Then Xiao Jingshan's escape
must pose a serious threat.

238
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,300
We'll stay at Canglei Palace
to take care of His Lordship.

239
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,720
Divine Lord, if you need help
tracking Xiao Jingshan down,

240
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
just say the word.

241
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,570
Why should we help?

242
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,710
I guess
it's what His Lordship would want.

243
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,940
Bai Jiusi,

244
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,740
don't think you can run away
by falling asleep.

245
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,520
You took punishment for me. So what?

246
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,460
The pain I suffered

247
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,410
was real.

248
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,180
Too much has happened between us.

249
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,300
Too tangled to undo.

250
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,640
Too deep to forget.

251
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,020
Bai Jiusi,

252
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,080
I won't apologize to you.

253
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,250
If you never wake up, fine.

254
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,040
Then we'll never see each other again.

255
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,270
Maybe that's how we both find peace.

256
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,220
So you're protesting by trying to die?

257
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,640
All I did was destroy
your spiritual energy.

258
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,000
You've already formed immortal bones.

259
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
You'll still live for eternity.

260
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,370
Stop overthinking it.

261
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,750
You really are heartless.

262
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,830
Ling'er,

263
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,160
you can still do whatever you want.

264
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,480
As long as I'm here,

265
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,680
no one will ever hurt you.

266
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,010
The one who's hurt her the most is you.

267
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,590
Divine Lord.

268
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,930
This is all my fault.

269
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,300
I shouldn't have sent you back
just to save you.

270
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,600
It's fine now. I'll take you back.

271
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,260
Wait.

272
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,210
Divine Lord Siling,

273
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,120
even if you and His Lordship
have made up,

274
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,300
she's still my daughter,

275
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,210
so you don't just get to take her away.

276
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,200
Sometimes I really want
to beat you to death.

277
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,890
You think I'm scared of you?

278
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,840
Siling, think about it.

279
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,310
Everything Ling'er's been through
started because of you.

280
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,590
You manipulated her

281
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,720
into staying away from her own father.

282
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
You made her an enemy of His Lordship

283
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,720
and dragged her
into one dangerous thing after another.

284
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,290
That's why I had no choice
but to destroy her spiritual energy.

285
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,750
Now she's no longer

286
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,070
useful to you.

287
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,350
What more do you want?

288
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,580
You really don't get it, do you?

289
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,390
Ling'er doesn't like you

290
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,820
not because she was manipulated.

291
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,550
It's because of you.

292
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,130
Yes, I've asked her to do a lot of things.

293
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,240
But I've always explained why.

294
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,520
I told her what the risks were.

295
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,260
And most importantly,

296
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,170
I gave her the right to choose.

297
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,540
I'm not like you—

298
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,890
doing things that hurt her

299
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,540
while claiming it's for her own good.

300
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,460
Ask yourself honestly:

301
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
when have you ever truly given her

302
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,260
the chance to decide for herself?

303
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,790
Let's go.

304
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,350
Wait.

305
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,350
Do you really have to
push Ling'er this hard?

306
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,070
Come to her again when you've learned

307
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,120
to respect your own daughter.

308
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,570
Grandmaster is back.

309
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,550
Suguan.

310
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,280
How do you like the Nine Heavens?

311
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
It's boring as hell here.

312
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,400
Yeah, pretty boring.

313
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,420
It's time for us to go back.

314
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,280
My poor Bian,

315
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,350
your death was so unjust.

316
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,870
This is for Ox-Head.

317
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,310
Horse-Face needs some too.

318
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,240
Burn more.

319
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,850
You…

320
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,260
Master, stop burning joss paper.

321
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:54,790
Master,

322
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,920
I heard a cultivator once say

323
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,140
those killed by immortals

324
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,550
don't even get a chance
to enter the underworld.

325
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,630
W-What the hell are you saying?

326
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,150
My Bian died a wrongful death!

327
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,030
This money is for bribing the ghosts.

328
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,000
If those ghosts

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,680
bully him in the underworld,

330
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,140
I'll kill you first!

331
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,520
Just let him burn it.

332
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,190
He's quite pitiful.

333
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,680
Yes. After he burns some joss paper,

334
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,310
he might feel a bit better.

335
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,420
Everyone says cultivation is good.

336
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,070
Master.

337
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,570
Jingyun Sect is a top-tier immortal sect.

338
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
Who would've thought that
after all that cultivation,

339
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,240
his son didn't even leave a body behind?

340
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,480
-Keep burning.
-Stop it.

341
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
He just lost his son. Let's go.

342
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,900
Burn more.

343
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,270
What's that sound?

344
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,310
Master, Master, listen.

345
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,600
What's that sound?

346
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,640
That's…

347
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,590
Young Master is back.

348
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,290
I told you burning joss paper would work.

349
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,750
They've all come back.

350
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,680
You see that?

351
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,410
[Prosperity]

352
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,170
Grandmaster, did you go to
the Nine Heavens this time

353
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,910
just to lure out Xiao Jingshan?

354
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,150
Yes. Unfortunately,
I miscalculated something.

355
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,610
I realized Zhang Suan was being used

356
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,820
but didn't expect
he'd been cursed with the Life-Link Curse.

357
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,090
Xuan Wei, did you know about
Grandmaster's plan from the start?

358
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,570
I didn't.

359
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,830
I only sensed something off
about Qing Yang's death.

360
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,350
And then Grandmaster sent

361
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,880
the weakest disciple,
Jiang Bian, to issue the challenge.

362
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,190
That's when I knew
Master had another plan.

363
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,590
Zhang Suan

364
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,110
locked himself in the meditation room

365
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,660
after he woke up
and realized what he had done.

366
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,750
He hasn't had a drop of water since.

367
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,680
I tried talking to him,
but it didn't work.

368
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,790
Grandmaster, if you have time,
please go check on him.

369
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,920
I will.

370
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,880
Right now, our top priority
is finding Xiao Jingshan.

371
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,440
To turn Bai Jiusi

372
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,900
and me against each other,

373
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,550
he waited for hundreds of years.

374
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,760
It shows how calculating he is.

375
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,370
Split the disciples into teams
and search for him

376
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,120
with everything we've got.

377
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,580
This time,
he won't stay hidden in the shadows.

378
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,590
[Prosperity]

379
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,640
Even if we have to search
all 12 provinces of Han,

380
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,750
we must find him.

381
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,030
Yes, Grandmaster.

382
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,040
Birth, aging, sickness, and death

383
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,260
are trials every mortal must endure.

384
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,230
Formation, existence,
destruction, and emptiness

385
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,430
are the four stages of the cosmic cycle.

386
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,170
I have a feeling.

387
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,300
The world is about
to face destruction again.

388
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,550
And it might be caused by him.

389
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,840
We'll go make the arrangements right away.

390
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,440
[Prosperity]

391
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,590
You have something else to say to me?

392
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,010
I just want to ask,

393
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,110
what will you do about
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

394
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,380
Someone will take care of Canglei Palace.

395
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,840
Xiao Jingshan
shouldn't be able to harm him.

396
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,960
That's not what I'm asking.

397
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,050
I want to know
if you still want to kill him.

398
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,270
I don't know.

399
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,780
He took the punishment for me.

400
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,670
But everything I suffered
was because of him.

401
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,960
I don't know which weighs more.

402
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,290
I don't know what I should let go of
or what I should hold on to.

403
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,020
The best ending I can think of

404
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,600
is never seeing him again.

405
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,990
Master, don't overthink it.
Just follow your heart.

406
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,790
No matter what you choose,

407
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,790
I'll always follow you.

408
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,230
Yeah.

409
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,230
Why overthink it and upset myself?

410
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,360
I'll go check on Zhang Suan.

411
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,070
You're becoming
more and more ill-mannered.

412
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,070
You knew I was coming
and didn't even get up to greet me.

413
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,410
Eat something.

414
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,970
You haven't learned to fast properly yet.

415
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,750
What? You want me to feed you?

416
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,250
Did it hurt?

417
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,310
No.

418
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,480
It was all just an act.

419
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,490
That stab you gave me felt like a tickle.

420
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,480
Sorry.

421
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,700
It's not your fault.

422
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,050
You should've killed him then and there.

423
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,680
My life doesn't matter.

424
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,480
Zhang Suan, listen carefully.

425
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
Every single person

426
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,480
in Jingyun Sect matters.

427
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,640
No matter what happens,

428
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,960
I won't give up

429
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,620
the chance for anyone to live.

430
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,840
If you have time,

431
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,610
help me look after Ling'er.

432
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,190
What happened to her?

433
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,850
Her father stripped her
of her spiritual energy.

434
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,310
You once lost
all your spiritual energy too.

435
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,960
So maybe if you talk to her, it'll help.

436
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,160
Okay.

437
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,780
Grandmaster,
someone from Canglei Palace is here.

438
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,240
Who is it?

439
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,010
Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

440
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,900
If you don't want to see him,
you don't have to.

441
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,270
Stay here and eat. I'll go check it out.

442
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,550
Didn't they say you wouldn't wake up?

443
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,950
How are you already fine?

444
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,250
Darling!

445
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,630
[Temple of the Primordial God]

446
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,650
[Temple of the Primordial God]

447
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,250
Where is my master?

448
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,719
I advise you not to meet him now.

449
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,500
What's that supposed to mean?

450
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,360
If Master's already awake,

451
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,500
why can't I see him?

452
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,180
Are you hiding something from me?

453
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,150
If you insist on seeing him, then come.

454
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,350
What's wrong with Master?

455
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,060
Why do you both look so grim?

456
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,310
See for yourself.

457
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,360
Master.

458
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,550
Who are you?

459
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,800
Have you seen my wife?

460
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Your wife?

461
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,990
Look.

462
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
I've prepared so many gifts for her,

463
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,300
but I can't find her anywhere.

464
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,970
Have you seen her?

465
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,510
Did that witch Siling

466
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,190
do something to Master again?

467
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,920
It really wasn't her this time.

468
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,960
I told you—

469
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,550
Master's primordial spirit
has been damaged over and over.

470
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,680
His divine soul was barely hanging on.

471
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,590
It's already a miracle that he woke up.

472
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,250
This is probably what happens
when the primordial spirit

473
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,580
takes that much damage.

474
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,120
Now his mind is like that of a child.

475
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,040
He doesn't remember anyone,

476
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,550
except for…

477
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,380
his wife.

478
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,740
No way!

479
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,440
Our master is Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

480
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,810
who lives as long as the sun and moon.

481
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,840
How could this happen?

482
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,360
The injuries Master suffered

483
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,700
are enough to kill both of us

484
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,340
several times.

485
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,760
No. Figure something out.

486
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,050
Master has always been dignified.

487
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,470
He can't be seen like this!

488
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,850
Why don't you treat him?

489
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,200
All we can do is let him rest.

490
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,280
After his divine soul recovers,

491
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,740
he'll go back to how he was.

492
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,960
Sir,

493
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,700
if you see my wife,

494
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,230
can you take me to her?

495
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,980
Master, please don't call me that.

496
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,670
No, no, no, no,

497
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,820
I really need to find my wife.

498
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,640
Grandpa,

499
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,900
can you take me to her?

500
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,480
Please.

501
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,670
Maybe we should just take him to her?

502
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,970
No way!

503
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,670
Siling's tried
to kill Master more than once.

504
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,110
If we send him to her now,

505
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,450
we'd be handing a lamb to a wolf.

506
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,660
Divine Lord Siling
surely knows what's important.

507
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,510
His Lordship's safety
concerns the Infinite Stele.

508
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,180
She wouldn't hurt him.

509
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,160
Still no!

510
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,550
You say no to this, no to that!

511
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,550
Get up, all of you!

512
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,320
Get up!

513
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,850
I'm telling you,

514
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,020
I need to find my wife!

515
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,860
My master would in no way act like this.

516
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,090
Hurry, take him to see Siling.

517
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,970
Darling.

518
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,310
I prepared this hairpin for you myself.

519
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,430
Do you like it?

520
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,520
We had no choice

521
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,200
but to bring him here.

522
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,440
Please, Divine Lord,
let him stay here for a few days.

523
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,480
Why should I?

524
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,610
He's your master.
Take care of him yourselves.

525
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,160
Don't follow me.

526
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,230
No.

527
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,600
Darling, wherever you go, I go.

528
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,110
Bai Jiusi, quit acting.

529
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,880
Are you pretending

530
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,540
you've forgotten everything

531
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,670
because I said too much

532
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,070
has happened between us?

533
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,030
His Lordship truly is badly injured.

534
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,360
Otherwise, given his personality,

535
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,100
he'd never act this way.

536
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,960
This is a turbulent time.

537
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,070
Even if we take him back today,

538
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,170
he'll still demand to see you.

539
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,210
And no one
at Canglei Palace dares stop him.

540
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,150
If word gets out and someone
takes advantage of the situation,

541
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,480
His Lordship may be harmed,

542
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,010
and it could be disastrous.

543
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,910
Please, Divine Lord, for the greater good,

544
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,650
let him stay here for a few days.

545
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,160
Once he recovers,
we definitely won't trouble you again.

546
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,550
Yes.

547
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,560
You don't need
to arrange attendants for him.

548
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,960
Just let him stay.

549
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,630
We'll keep him safe ourselves.

550
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,750
Darling.

551
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,610
Darling, don't you like this hairpin?

552
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,940
Just take a look.

553
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,670
[Temple of the Primordial God]

554
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,410
I spent a long time choosing it.

555
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,710
Look.

556
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,910
It's useless.

557
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,090
No matter how hard you try,

558
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,620
lost cultivation won't come back.

559
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,050
Are you here to laugh at me?

560
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,630
I've got better things to do.

561
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,990
Qingyue asked me to check on you.

562
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,640
Master meant well.

563
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
But you might not.

564
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,050
I once lost my cultivation too.

565
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,740
I might've had it even worse than you.

566
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,810
My foundation was destroyed.

567
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,760
I became completely ordinary.

568
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,430
At that time, did you…

569
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,290
ever think about dying?

570
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,550
Yeah.

571
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,150
Falling from a high place

572
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,090
is not a pleasant feeling.

573
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,750
Of course I thought that

574
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,910
if I just died,

575
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,590
it'd all be over.

576
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,920
But one day,

577
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,520
I suddenly didn't want to die anymore.

578
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,280
Why not?

579
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,860
Because someone showed up.

580
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,900
I wanted to live for her.

581
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,950
Do you

582
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,980
still like her now?

583
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,590
That's never changed.

584
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,170
If life gets too hard,

585
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,390
give yourself a reason to keep going.

586
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,000
You'll find one.

587
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,710
If I remember right,
the spiritual energy you have now

588
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,320
was passed to you
by Xiao Jingshan, wasn't it?
