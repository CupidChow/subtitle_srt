00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,370
Your grave injuries brought me into the mortal world,

188
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,970
then you proposed to marry me just to get close to me.

189
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,260
You then saved the White Snake, stole my powers,

190
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,310
provoked me into using the Heaven-Turning Seal,

191
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,440
and then delivering the final blow with the Seal itself.

192
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,440
Ruyue,

193
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,510
haven't you ever wondered...

194
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,560
why did everything go as smoothly as planned?

195
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,320
That's because I was cooperating with you.

196
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,480
When you used the Heaven-Turning Seal on me,

197
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,490
were you not thinking of sealing me completely?

198
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,470
If I can seal, I can also unseal.

199
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,630
What I wanted was for you to drop your disguise.

200
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,360
This was the only way.

201
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,570
Whatever happens is written by Heaven’s will.

202
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,300
It was the Heaven-Turning Seal that brought us here.

203
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,900
Ruyue,

204
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,940
doesn’t it feel like

205
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,270
we're back to how things were 400 years ago?

206
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,820
[460 years ago]

207
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,500
[Meng Qi, Meng Chi]

208
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,350
Father, is this your new workplace?

209
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,760
It's beautiful!

210
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,920
Yes, this is it.

211
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,740
Chi, do you remember what I told you before we came?

212
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,980
What did I say?

213
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,750
I must be diligent, not run around,

214
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
listen to you,

215
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,730
and stay close to you.

216
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,730
Such a good boy, Chi.

217
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,100
Let's go.

218
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,530
Who are you looking for?

219
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,870
I'm looking for Housekeeper Wu.

220
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,070
Please wait a moment.

221
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,480
[Qichi Hall]

222
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,930
Who are you?

223
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,110
Housekeeper Wu, my name is Meng Qi.

224
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm here to paint lanterns for this household.

225
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,010
This...

226
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,310
is a letter of recommendation from the accountant, Mr. Liu.

227
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,540
[To the housekeeper]

228
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,990
[Mr. Meng Qi, a familiar figure at the prefectural residence, is personally known by Mr. Liu. He comes highly recommended by the renowned painter, Mr. Liang.]

229
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,160
Come in.

230
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,480
Thank you. Let's go.

231
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,920
Our master has a good temperament and is kind.

232
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,620
He's never harsh to his servants.

233
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,820
You'll see for yourselves soon enough.

234
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,720
Yes.

235
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,600
It's truly your good fortune to work here.

236
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,300
Yes, yes.

237
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,000
Mr. Liu has told us all about it.

238
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
Just one thing. My master likes peace and quiet.

239
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,470
Few people live here.

240
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,590
While you're working here,

241
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,440
just focus on doing your job well.

242
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,160
If you have no other business, don't wander around.

243
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,440
Apart from your own duties,

244
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,000
don't ask about anything else.

245
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,530
Alright.

246
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
Above all, keep a close eye on your child.

247
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,680
Make sure he never enters the master's courtyard.

248
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,510
Meng Chi, did you hear that?

249
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,320
Yes, I did.

250
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Her Ladyship saved my granddaughter's life.

251
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,440
I just want to express my gratitude with a kowtow.

252
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,640
You'd better go back.

253
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,810
Housekeeper Wu.

254
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,920
Madam Yang.

255
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,750
What's the rush? What's up?

256
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,370
I'm here to kowtow to Her Ladyship.

257
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
The miraculous medicine she gave me

258
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040
saved my granddaughter's life.

259
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,370
You have no idea.

260
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,720
Physician Zhu from Qianchun Clinic and

261
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Physician Zhang from Baoren Clinic both said there was no hope,

262
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,620
but with just one pill from Her Ladyship, it worked wonders.

263
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,480
My granddaughter's fever broke in just a few days.

264
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,410
She can eat and drink

265
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,290
and is full of energy now.

266
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,260
Isn't that a miracle drug?

267
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,070
What miracle drug?

268
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,760
Don't go around spreading rumors.

269
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,840
If more people come begging for medicine

270
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,470
and the master finds out, you might get kicked out.

271
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,110
I understand, I understand.

272
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,110
Her Ladyship's out visiting friends.

273
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,110
She's been gone for several days

274
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,720
and we don't know when she'll be back.

275
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,070
Besides, she doesn't like this sort of courtesy.

276
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,590
If you really want to kowtow,

277
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,790
just do it towards the inner courtyard.

278
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,560
Yes, yes.

279
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,430
Thank you, Housekeeper Wu.

280
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,000
Let's go.

281
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,440
Her Ladyship is like a saint, always helping those in need.

282
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,170
I'm so grateful to you, My Lady.

283
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,500
You saved my granddaughter.

284
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,000
Thank you, My Lady.

285
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,630
Meng Chi.

286
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,200
Meng Chi!

287
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,960
Come.

288
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,610
It's all thanks to you, My Lady.

289
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,030
Don't run around.

290
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,750
Okay.

291
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,640
Puppy.

292
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,570
Puppy!

293
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,590
Don't run, don't run!

294
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,110
Come here!

295
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,990
No, don't go!

296
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,720
Come here and I'll treat you to a bone.

297
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,350
I'll treat you to a bone!

298
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,780
Thank you, my lady.

299
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,050
So you finally decided to come back.

300
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,680
We said we'd face the love tribulation
in the mortal realm as one.

301
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,160
Now, we've descended here and even got married,

302
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,760
but we've made no progress in the tribulation.

303
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,900
Don't be impatient.

304
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,850
Once I'm done with the business,

305
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,110
I'll definitely come back to be with you.

306
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,410
All you do is open shops and make money outside.

307
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,830
I don't understand why an immortal like you

308
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,880
is so obsessed with

309
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,680
the art of commerce in the mortal realm.

310
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,050
Since we came to the mortal realm for the tribulation,

311
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,510
we must follow the rules of the mortal realm.

312
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,400
We can't casually use magic

313
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,660
or meddle with the mortal world's karma.

314
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,130
If I don't go out to earn some money,

315
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,860
how will I support this family?

316
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,360
As you know, someone has been

317
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,960
giving silver ingots to beggars on the street,

318
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,840
and pills to the servants at home.

319
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,370
If this continues,

320
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,250
I'm afraid our wealth will be squandered away sooner or later.

321
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,640
So you know about it all.

322
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,820
With your little tricks,

323
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,720
who do you think you can fool?

324
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,060
You've seen Madam Yang's granddaughter.

325
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,980
She's clever, adorable, and pure as snow.

326
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,280
If she had really died from that illness,

327
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,140
wouldn't it have been such a pity?

328
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,820
But you need to understand,

329
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,550
All things come from nature, each with its own karmic path.

330
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,350
Everyone has their own destiny.

331
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,240
Why do you have to put yourself

332
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,440
in a difficult position for their sake?

333
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,630
So full of lofty principles.

334
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
To put it bluntly,

335
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,990
you're just afraid of interfering in mortal affairs

336
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,190
and attracting the Heavenly Emissary.

337
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,710
I'm glad you understand.

338
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,810
We're here in the mortal realm to overcome our tribulations,

339
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,010
not to indulge in your acts of kindness.

340
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,180
Don't blame me for not warning you upfront.

341
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,710
If you really attract the Heavenly Emissary,

342
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,430
I won't be able to help you.

343
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,140
I understand.

344
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,860
By the way, a new child arrived at the mansion today.

345
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,420
He looks dazed and not very bright.

346
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,610
I even transformed into a puppy and gave him a fright.

347
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,230
Don't you think children are adorable?

348
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,720
Why don't we have one of our own?

349
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,030
Who knows, having a child is just

350
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,630
what we need to overcome our love tribulation.

351
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
You really like children that much?

352
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,600
You don't like them?

353
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,600
I have no interest.

354
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,870
I'll go refill the tea.

355
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,900
[Lord Yu Ya]

356
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,830
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, you came to see me

357
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,690
just to ask about having a child?

358
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,240
Yes.

359
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,930
Forgive me for being frank,

360
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,360
but I think...

361
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,360
you should forget about it.

362
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,720
Why?

363
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,020
When immortals conceive a child,

364
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,790
it must be nurtured with their own vital energy.

365
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,840
You and Divine Lord Siling are in the mortal realm for the tribulation.

366
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,870
If she were to conceive a child now,

367
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,430
the child would absorb her vital energy and weaken her further.

368
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,710
In that case,

Divine Lord Siling's love tribulation

370
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,380
would probably become...

371
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,300
even more difficult to overcome.

372
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,810
[Qichi Hall]

373
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,300
That hurts!

374
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,310
You really are a clumsy child, aren't you?

375
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,180
Big Sister?

376
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,030
Pass me the cage.

377
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,040
Here.

378
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,900
What kind of cricket is this?

379
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,400
It looks quite impressive.

380
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,420
My father said

381
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,060
it's a black iron cricket,

382
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,510
also known as the iron-skinned cricket.

383
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,090
It's dark and glossy, with a large body and long wings.

384
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,690
It's quite fierce in fights.

385
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,280
That's nothing.

386
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,900
Let me tell you.

387
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,110
For fights, the golden cricket is the best.

388
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,010
Golden ones?

389
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,930
That's right.

390
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,760
[Yunqi Hall]

391
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,020
Golden crickets are very rare.

392
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,270
They are usually found in the north.

393
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,270
They have a blue face, red fangs, brownish-yellow necks,

394
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,160
and also yellow legs, bellies, whiskers,

395
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,760
complete with golden wings.

396
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,070
So it is golden all over?

397
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,480
Pretty much, except for its emerald green wing covers.

398
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,340
It's not very noticeable though.

399
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,840
Golden crickets have a deep, rich chirp.

400
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,380
It's strong and powerful.

401
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,160
When the sunlight hits them,

402
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,710
they shimmer like golden armor.

403
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,250
It's quite impressive.

404
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,830
What do you do in this mansion?

405
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,000
I work as a servant in this mansion.

406
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,440
But the master here

407
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,310
doesn’t seem to like noisy places.

408
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,150
He never receives guests and rarely goes out.

409
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:08,040
[Yunqi Hall]

410
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,930
But my father is very skilled.

411
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,600
He's busy with work all day.

412
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,550
Look!

413
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,100
The paintings on the lanterns in this mansion

414
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,760
were all painted by my father.

415
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,110
Aren't they beautiful?

416
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,150
Since your father is so skilled,

417
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,280
why don't you learn to paint lanterns from him

418
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,810
instead of being a servant?

419
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,050
I was born color-blind.

420
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,110
So I can't learn to paint.

421
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,719
Who says you must be able to distinguish colors to paint?

422
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,670
Distinguishing colors doesn't necessarily require vision.

423
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,150
It can also be done through smell.

424
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,110
Smell?

425
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,670
Yes.

426
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,580
Every living being in this world has the ability

427
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,630
to connect with everything else

428
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,690
through their own existence.

429
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,400
Humans have six senses:

430
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,710
sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and thought.

431
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,240
You've only lost one sense.

432
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,030
But with your own effort,

433
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,930
you can still make up for it.

434
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,330
Really?

435
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,420
Smell this.

What does it smell like?

437
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,260
It's astringent and cool,

438
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,840
with a faint, fresh fragrance.

439
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,470
Yes, fresh fragrance.

440
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,570
This faint, refreshing fragrance is the scent of green.

441
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,520
Wild grass sprouts from rock crevices,

442
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,510
while bamboo stands firm in the chilly wind.

443
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,990
They thrive endlessly and stay resilient,

444
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,110
so green is the color of vitality.

445
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,810
Green must be a beautiful color.

446
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,470
Yes, every color in this world

What does gold smell like?

Is it the smell of golden crickets?

Silly.
