Xingman!

00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,729
Xingman, what are you doing here?

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
I've looked all over for you.

7
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,840
Xingman, what's wrong?

8
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,470
I miss home.

9
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,720
You don't have to
stay here to keep me company.

10
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,460
You can return to the Yinlian Sect first.

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,990
After I wrap things up here,

12
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,450
I'll go find you.

13
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,170
When will that be?

14
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,079
How long do I have to wait for you to take

15
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,540
the initiative to find me?

16
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,110
Xingman, once this matter is settled,

17
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,340
I will definitely go back with you.

18
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,590
You have responsibilities you can't shirk

19
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,800
and your master and fellows
you can't leave behind.

20
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,150
Yet to me, you always say,

21
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,520
"Wait, wait, and wait a bit more."

22
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,240

23
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,360
all I want is you.

Why can't you want me only?

25
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,700
I'll ask you one more time.

26
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,400
Are you going with me or not?

27
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,960

28

take the initiative to find you

to think it through.

How about this? Call me big bro,

My Lady, His Lordship was whining
to meet you.

55
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,400
Or he wouldn't go to bed.

56
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,130

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
but to bring him here.

Well, then, My Lady, I'm taking my leave.

64
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,050
you think pretending to forget
everything from the past

65

and upset you?

Please don't leave me behind again.

74
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,250
Bai Jiusi, what on earth
are you trying to do?

75
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,370
I only want to be with you.

76
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,080
Master.

77

What brings you here?

78
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,910
I heard that Heavenly Lord Dacheng
came to lodge in your place.

79
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,860
So I came to drop in on you, Master.

80
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,140
You're worried I can't let go of my hatred
and might hurt him?

81
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,160
You're always the most sensible one.
So there's no need to worry about that.

82
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,150
I'm actually concerned about
how you feel inside, Master.

83
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,550
Have you ever had a crush on someone?

84
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,440
There was once
during my days in seclusion.

85
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,700
Since my seclusion kicked off,

86
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,440
I've often caught the fragrance of flowers
drifting into the cave.

87
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,240
I didn't pay much attention to it

88
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
until one time...

89
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,640
At that moment,
I wanted to open my eyes and take a look.

90
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,900
I'm a coward.

91
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,220
I fell for someone
but didn't dare to tell him.

92
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,610
I only had the guts

93
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,880
to secretly leave a bouquet
at his doorstep every few days.

94
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,410
I picked all the flowers

95
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
on Yufan Mountain.

96
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,550
Then I started traveling around,

97
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
leaving new flowers at his door
whenever I found some.

98
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,130
I kept drinking all day long,

99
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,600
hoping that alcohol could
help me pluck up my courage

100
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,030
and tell him my feelings for him

101
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,680
the next time we met.

102
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,970
Unfortunately, I'm uniquely gifted.

103
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,340
The more I drink, the more sober I become.

104
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,550
It doesn't help me
summon up courage at all.

105
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,190
Did you open your eyes to see?

106
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,960
No, I gave up later.

107
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,320
Some stuff's better left in the dark.

108
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,040
I was in seclusion
with unfinished responsibilities

109
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,830
and didn't want to mess up someone's life.

110
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,310
Did you later find out
who was sending you flowers?

111
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
Yes, I did.

112
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,030
She once asked me

113
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,250
about my favorite flower.

114
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,290
Master Xuan Wei,
do you have any favorite flowers?

115
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,390
I don't like flowers.

116
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,470
Dandelions are not bad though.

117
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,220
I see.

118
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,460
Sorry.

119
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
It was my own choice
and had nothing to do with you, Master.

That's interesting.

Despite my depleted spiritual energy,

145
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,560
I don't want to be
a burden on you, Divine Lord.

146
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,150
I've been delving into artifact forging
and formations the past few days.

147
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,280
I remember the Great Wilderness Stele
is still in your possession, right?

148
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,370
I've heard about
what happened the other day.

149
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,870
This Great Wilderness Stele is listed

150
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,800
in the Record of Artifacts
Xiao Jingshan gave to you.

151
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,910
According to my investigation,
unlike ordinary artifacts,

152
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,170
this item takes countless days to forge.

153
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,320
So I think this artifact must have been

154
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,380
forged by Xiao Jingshan for himself.

155
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,150
By repairing the Great Wilderness Stele,

156
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,010
we can rebuild the past illusion.

157
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,510
Perhaps it'll reveal

158
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,320
some clues about Xiao Jingshan.

159
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,150
I remember you said
you tried to activate the formation

160
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,380
remaining on it by all means but failed.

161
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,110
I can't activate it,

162
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,750
but maybe he can pull it off.

163
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,720
Zhang Suan's
current cultivation techniques

164
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
all belonged to Xiao Jingshan before.

165
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,650
Besides, he once entered

166
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,670
the illusion you used
the Great Wilderness Stele to create.

167
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,130
Based on my experience
in artifact forging,

168
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,840
Zhang Suan

169
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,430
should be the real owner
of the Great Wilderness Stele now.

170
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,530
Only he

171
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,250
can activate
the repairing formation on it.

172
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,240
I can give it a try.

173
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,770
Then let's do it.

Look, Divine Lord!

178
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,970
It's really been repaired.

179
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,960
Ling'er, did you just say that
after the repair,

180
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,630
we could also restore the past illusion

181
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,830
created by the Great Wilderness Stele?

182
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
Are you okay to continue?

183
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,400
Sure.

184
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,089
Just tell me what to do.

185
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,880
Just like before,

186
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,310
channel your spiritual energy
to the Great Wilderness Stele,

187
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,569
follow the spiritual energy paths on it,

188
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,950
find the past you want to see,
and conjure it up.

189
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,660
Divine Lord,
my spiritual energy has been drained,

190
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,960
so I can't enter
the Great Wilderness Stele.

191
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,400
Zhang Suan needs
to activate the formation,

192
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,880
so he can't enter the illusion either.

193
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,270
Are you ready to enter the illusion

194
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,330
of the Great Wilderness Stele again?

195
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,440
In the past, Xiao Jingshan was always
lurking in the dark

196
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,210
spying on our lives.

197
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,070
Now it's my turn to peep into his life.

198
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,840
Let's begin.

199
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,800
Darling.

200
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,630
Darling,

201
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,050
were you trying
to leave me behind again just now?

202
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,370
No.

203
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,310
Glad to hear that!

204
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,170
Anyway, wherever you go,
I'm sticking with you.

205
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,270
Where are we?

206
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,830
Honey, I'm back.

207
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,570
Welcome back.

208
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,460
Darling, where are you going?

209
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,880
How's Mr. Wei's leg?

210
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,410
He probably can walk without his crutches

211
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,750
in a couple of days.

212
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,480
He was just saying that
we don't need to bring him meals anymore.

213
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,240
Here you are. He fell over and got hurt
while hunting with you.

214
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,920
Besides, he lives alone.

215
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,960
We should show more concern for him.

216
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,210
Yes, you're right, honey.

217
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,140
Time to eat!

218
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,890
Come on, Baby Bean,
you must be hungry. Come here.

219
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,090
Dad!

220
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,290
Good boy.

221
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,830
Father, Mother, lunch's ready!

222
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,570
-Coming.
-Okay.

223
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,500
Take your seats.

224
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,400
Baby Bean, hand out the chopsticks.

225
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,870
Here.

226
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,830
Darling.

227
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,830
Sit properly.

228
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,490
Why do you keep looking at him?

229
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,720
-Yes, I missed you.
-Good boy.

230
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Look at me.

231
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,550
Did you behave yourself at home?

232
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,010
Look at me.

233
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,500
He's been very well-behaved.

234
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,550
-Baby Bean's grown up.
-Thanks.

235
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,280
He can hand out chopsticks now.

236
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,640
Good.

237
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,440
Thank you.

238
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,240
Here you are.

239
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,430
Jingshan, has Mr. Wei's leg
gotten any better?

240
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,100
Mr. Wei's leg will recover
in just a few days.

241
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,810
Come on, let's eat.

242
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,890
Darling, are you hungry too?

243
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,250
Come on, have some more.

244
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,950
Here you are, Mother.

245
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,440
What are you eating?

246
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,790
-Share some with Baby Bean.
-Okay.

247
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,110
I'm talking to you!

248
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,550
Eat some more meat.

249
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,590
Mother, keep it to yourself.

250
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,550
That's weird.

251
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,290
Why do they seem like they can't see us?

252
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Tastes good, huh?

253
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,310
Here, Baby Bean.

254
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,210
Give it a try.

255
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,870
Try it.

256
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,290
Dad, don't forget that you promised

257
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,200
to take me to the lantern fair tonight.

258
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,310
I want to light lanterns
and watch acrobatics.

259
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,400
Come back home early.

260
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,710
Alright, I won't forget.

261
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,710
Come here.

262
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,470
Take it slow.

263
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,470
I'm leaving then.

264
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,650
Come back early.

265
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,000
Goodbye, Dad.

266
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,550
This is not what I expected.

267
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,120
Let's go.

268
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,550
Darling,

269
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,540
why do you keep staring at him?

270
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
Why aren't you talking to me?

271
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,610
Why have you become so talkative?

272
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,110
Beautiful.

273
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,240
Look!

274
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,140
Lanterns for sale, take a look!

275
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,980
Look over here!

276
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,090
Look! Look!

277
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,440
Beautiful.

278
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,070
So pretty.

279
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,110
Hurry up, or we'll be late.

280
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,150
Alright!

281
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,310
Nice!

282
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,170
Bravo!

283
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,960
This one.

284
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,240
Bravo! Bravo! Brilliant!

285
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,750
Do another one.

286
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,510
Bravo!

287
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,190
Nice!

288
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,990
Bravo!

289
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,760
Amazing.

290
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,370
Bravo!

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,550
Bravo! Bravo!

292
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,070
-One more!
-One more!

293
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,920
Do another one.

294
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,550
Awesome!

295
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,310
Bravo!

296
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,060
Darling, do you like this too?

297
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,340
I can do the same trick!

298
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,280
I want to go over there.

299
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,720
Let's go.

300
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,960
Come on, let's go.

301
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,860
Bravo!

302
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,860
Nice!

303
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,550
Look.

304
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,540
It's moving!

305
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,770
Which one do you like?

306
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,350
This one.

307
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,400
You like this one?

308
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,880
Okay.

309
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,840
Be careful.

310
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,890
Take it slow.

311
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,590
-Be careful.
-Stay safe.

312
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,070
Lanterns.

313
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,720
Take a look!

314
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,350
Darling.

315
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,750
Check these lanterns out!

316
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,020
Honey.

317
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,920
Hey, people are watching.

318
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,710
Xiao Jingshan, why on earth did you create

319
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,880
this illusion?

320
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,520
This lantern we bought today
is so beautiful.

321
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
Do you like it?

322
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,370
I saw you staring
at the lantern he was holding.

323
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,480
So I conjured one up.

324
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,720
Do you like it?

325
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,640
Darling,

326
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,050
are you still mad at me
for being talkative?

327
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Why aren't you even smiling?

328
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,330
Darling, you smiled!

329
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,510
My darling smiled!

330
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,780
You look so beautiful when you smile.

331
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,210
Give me another smile.

332
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,930
Gorgeous.

333
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,140
Bai Jiusi,

334
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,950
how am I supposed to deal with you?

335
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,260
Why is it morning again?

336
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,220
What happened? Did I miss something?

337
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,480
Honey, I'm home.

338
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,330
Welcome back.

339
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,970
How's Mr. Wei's leg?

340
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,440
He probably can walk without his crutches

341
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,970
in a couple of days.

342
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,880
He was just saying that
we don't need to bring him meals anymore.

343
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,590
Here you are. He fell over and got hurt
while hunting with you.

344
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,310
Besides, he lives alone.

345
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,240
We should show more concern for him.

346
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,460
Yes, you're right, honey.

347
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,450
Time to eat!

348
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,240
Come on, Baby Bean,
you must be hungry. Come here.

349
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,270
Why do they

350
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,200
keep repeating the same old lines?

351
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,880
Dad!

352
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,040
Good boy.

353
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,450
Father, Mother, lunch's ready!

354
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,700
Okay, coming!

355
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,930
Baby Bean, hand out the chopsticks.

356
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,070
Sit properly.

357
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,310
Baby Bean's grown up.

358
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,480
He can hand out chopsticks now.

359
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,240
Did you behave yourself at home?

360
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,750
Did you listen to your mother?

361
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,810
-He's been very well-behaved.
-Yes.

362
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,400
Today's lunch is delicious.

363
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,770
Then have some more.

364
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,200
Is this illusion just repeating itself?

365
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,790
-Mother, have some more.
-Here, Baby Bean.

366
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,480
Okay.

367
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,090
Dad, don't forget that you promised

368
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,110
to take me to the lantern fair tonight.

369
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,350
I want to light lanterns
and watch acrobatics.

370
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,350
Come back home early.

371
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,720
Alright, I won't forget.

372
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,540
Come here.

373
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,510
Take it slow.

374
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
I'm leaving then.

375
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,400
Come back early.

376
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,350
Goodbye, Dad.

377
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,040
Let's go.

378
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,580
It's time to go.

379
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,680
Where to?

380
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,110
Divine Lord, you're back so soon.

381
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,310
Did you discover anything?

382
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,590
In that illusion, there's only one day

383
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,320
that keeps repeating.

384
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,400
So you mean

385
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,590
Xiao Jingshan used
the Great Wilderness Stele

386
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,720
to create an illusion of a certain day,

387
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,360
and he's been living
the same day over and over?

388
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,160
That's right.

389
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,930
Anything special about that day?

390
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,130
I found nothing special.

391
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,550
It's just Xiao Jingshan's daily life
with his family.

392
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,420
But I guess his inner struggle
might lie there.

393
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,440
Xiao Jingshan spent
a whole lot of time getting to know

394
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,070
Bai Jiusi and me
and turning us against each other,

395
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,730
which gave him the upper hand.

396
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
Now his advantage is gone.

397
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,010

399
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,300
You need to rest now.

400
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Your going along would only
drag the Divine Lord down.

401
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,550
I'm starting to believe that

Otherwise, given his personality,

404
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,400
how could he possibly condescend

405
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,330
to keep pestering the Divine Lord?

406
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,350
This symptom

407
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,750

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,000
and call the Yinlian Sect
an evil demonic sect.

550
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,960
Don't you want to eradicate those who

551
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,440
look down on you?

552
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,860
No, I don't.

553
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
They call the Yinlian Sect
an evil demonic sect

554
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,850
because we are unrestrained

555
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,490
and don't play by the rules.

556
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,830
But that doesn't mean we're bad.

557
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,970
You just seem to be up to no good.

558
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,840
I won't join hands with you, of course.

559
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,180
Never mind.

560
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,160
I didn't intend to negotiate
with you anyway.

561
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,140
So hideous!

562
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,000
D-Don't come any closer!

563
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,470
How many times have I told you

564
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,930
not to bully His Lordship?

565
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,460
Alright, alright, I got it.

566
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,040
Untie me now.

567
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,440
It's way too tight.

568
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,130
That's what've you got for not listening.

569
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,060
All things thrive, and that is creation.

570
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,520
The world settles down,
and that is stability.

571
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,710
Gradual destruction is decay.

572
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,360
Vanishing into nothing is void.

573
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,080
Over 400 years ago,
I slayed the Drought Dragon

574
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,710
and avoided the destructive calamity.

575
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,210
I didn't know it would still
be inevitable today.

576
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,690
You're a spiritual beast
with a sharp sense.

577
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,070
You must've also sensed
the upcoming calamity, right?

578
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,640
[Don't come back.]

579
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,650
[Don't come back.]

580
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,860
Immortal Lord, something terrible

581
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,390
happened at the Hell Ruins!

582
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,400
Greetings, Sect Leader.

583
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,650
D-Did anything happen?

584
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,760
Yin Tongzi is just a child.

585
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,110
Why are you afraid of him?

586
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,770
He threatened to eat me alive.

587
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,890
Go have fun.

588
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,330
Grandmaster.

589
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,450
Go.

590
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,550
What brought you back here?

591
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,400
Have you found
Xiao Jingshan's whereabouts?

592
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,280
I came here

593
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
to report other important matters.

594
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,730
Recently, Dan Yang and I,

595
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,880
along with other disciples,
have been searching everywhere.

596
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,070
We've discovered that
many people across the land

597
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,450
have lost their souls.

598
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,860
Normally, when the soul leaves the body,

599
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,960
the body dies immediately.

600
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,880
But lately, there have been
hundreds of these people

601
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,280
falling into a coma first

602
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,950
and dying in their dreams

603
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,630
on the fifth day.

604
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,560
Today is already the third day,

605
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,070
and things are getting out of hand.

606
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,760
So I came to seek help
from you, Grandmaster.

607
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,440
Any connection between the people
who lost their souls?

608
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,950
Where did their souls go?

609
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,190
They don't know each other.

610
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,840
Some are even thousands of miles apart.

611
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,710
I've sent the disciples

612
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,590
everywhere to check
how many people have fallen into comas.

613
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,320
I suspect that

614
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,590
it might be Xiao Jingshan's doing.

615
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,500
The Great Wilderness Stele he forged

616
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,400
can capture
the primordial spirits of immortals.

617
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,590
Now, he must have made
another magical artifact

618
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,720
that can capture the souls of mortals.

619
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,220
Capturing mortal souls
in such a high-profile way,

620
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,040
what on earth is he up to?

621
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,110
Xingman, Xingman.

622
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,000
Li Qingyue!

623
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,900
Mind your attitude
to our grandmaster.

624
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,760
Does your Jingyun Sect
have any available manpower

625
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,870
to go back with me to the Yinlian Sect?

626
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,030
What happened to your sect again?

627
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,710
My mother sent a message through a raven,

628
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,960
telling me not to go back.

629
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,580
No way she'd say that

630
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
unless something hit our sect hard.

631
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,460
Li Qingyue,

632
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,270
you can't ignore my trouble.

633
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,880
When the Jingyun Sect was in chaos,

634
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,210
I also stood by you
through thick and thin!

635
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,650
Xingman,

636
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,230
we don't know what's really going on yet.

637
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,230
Calm down first.

638
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:15,800
That's my mother.

639
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,390
How can I calm down?

640
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,320
Did anything happen in your place as well?

641
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,230
I just received a message
from Senior Long Yuan,

642
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,550
saying that the seal of the Hell Ruins
loosened for no reason.

643
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,840
The demonic beasts imprisoned inside

644
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,950
have all escaped.

645
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,670
Divine Lord, please accommodate
our Heavenly Lord for a few more days.

646
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,530
We need to return to Canglei Palace
to help subdue the demonic beasts.

647
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,280
So it's really Xiao Jingshan
behind all these issues.

648
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,030
He's been plotting for quite a while.

649
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,280
He knows he stands no chance
in a head-on fight.

650
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,880
So he's trying to split us up.

651
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,800
I'll keep an eye on Bai Jiusi

652
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,230
and keep him safe and sound.

653
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,070
You can go back to Canglei Palace.

654
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,400
Thank you, Divine Lord.

655
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,920
[Prosperity]

656
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,000
Zi Yang,

657
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,000
you go to Yinlian Sect with Qu Xingman.

658
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,110
I'll go with Dan Yang

659
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,760
to see what's going on
with those mortals who lost their souls.

660
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,820
Yes, Grandmaster.

661
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,920
Darling,

662
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,750
you can't move alone.

663
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,000
I must go with you.

664
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,550
We don't know if the Life-Link Curse
has been removed yet.

665
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,060
If Xiao Jingshan shows up,

666
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
don't kill him.

667
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,960
Catch him alive if possible.

668
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,920
I'll leave Xuan Wei at Jingyun Sect.

669
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,630
When you can no longer handle it,

670
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,830
avoid confrontation

671
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,760
and send a message
to ask Xuan Wei for reinforcements.

672
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,920
There's no time to waste.

673
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,000
Let's split up and move.
