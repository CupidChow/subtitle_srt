1
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,231
- Thank you.
- Good luck today.

2
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,109
Thank you.

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,402
Here you are.

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,320
Ms. Saijo is here.

6
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,072
- Looking forward to today.
- Welcome!

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,157
Thank you.

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,335
I look weird, don't I?
It doesn't suit me at all--

9
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,421
No, it suits you well.

10
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,006
Right?

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,841
Huh? Yeah.

12
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,760
Phew, okay.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,929
Yeah, you look great.

14
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,601
Okay, we're ready to roll!

15
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,977
Ready to roll!

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,562
Okay, let's do this.

17
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,022
- Yes.
- Go have fun.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,067
Starting from the scene
under the umbrella, please.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,526
Sure, thank you.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,903
Thank you.

21
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,031
Okay, touch-ups and adjustments, please!

22
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,082
Thank you.

23
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,833
Here you go.

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,751
Thanks.

25
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,878
Everyone on standby!

26
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,464
Okay. Rolling!

27
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,051
Scene One Alpha, take one. Alpha mark.

28
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,096
Okay, rain, please.

29
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,726
Okay, ready.

30
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,300
Cut! Okay!

31
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,218
That was cut!

32
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,433
What? You're appearing on <i>Music States?</i>

33
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,227
Yep, that's right.

34
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,730
Wow, haven't been on that in a while.

35
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,317
It's a special program.
They're setting up a special stage.

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,903
I'm not really interested in being on TV.

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,532
Wow. Me on <i>Music States.</i>

38
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,284
Going off on your own again.

39
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,037
What's the benefit
of appearing on TV nowadays?

40
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,373
It's not about what we appear in
but how we do it.

41
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,041
Huh? What do you mean by that?

42
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,710
We're the final act this time.

43
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,796
I guarantee it won't turn out badly,

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,423
so is everyone in?

45
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,799
Yes!

46
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,676
Good morning.

47
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,056
Good morning.

48
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,407
So cute.

49
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,536
Thanks for the other day.

50
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,288
Sure. What brings you here today?

51
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm also shooting next door.

52
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,210
They said TENBLANK is shooting here,
so I stopped by.

53
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,836
Come see me too, Naoki.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,921
"Naoki"?!

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,007
Okay. I'll go later if I can.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,344
Set change complete!

57
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,388
Sorry for interrupting. I'll be going.

58
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,599
Well then…

59
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,228
I'm looking forward to next time.

60
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,235
Okay, Mr. Fujitani. If you wouldn't mind.

61
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,205
Yeah, uh-huh…

62
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,749
Yeah, I know that!

63
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,960
Check with the station too.

64
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,507
Thank you for waiting.
Here's your coffee and café latte.

65
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,883
Thank you so much.

66
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,721
Here.

67
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,559
I'm against it.

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,775
Once you perform on TV,
there's no going back.

69
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,406
Because of Akane?

70
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,991
It's not just that.

71
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,119
We just have to be extremely careful.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,081
True, you might make a big splash on TV,

73
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,418
but it's out of step
with today's age of social media.

74
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,712
It might come off as outdated.

75
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,342
Naoki won't listen to my opinions at all.

76
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,347
At this rate, TENBLANK
will never be the best I imagine.

77
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,683
We aren't your property.

78
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,143
No one is--

79
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,644
Which is why

80
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,897
if it's a mistake, you won't be to blame.

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,526
Relax a little.

82
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,131
Good work today.

83
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,966
Thank you for everything.

84
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,304
The finale of <i>Music States.</i>

85
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,183
The finale of <i>Music States…</i>

86
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,560
<i>Music States!</i>

87
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,949
Huh?

88
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,957
Morning!

89
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,877
Did you not see the text?
There's no rehearsal today.

90
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,589
What was that song now?
Not one of TENBLANK's, right?

91
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,549
It doesn't really matter.

92
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,093
Could it possibly be one of your songs?

93
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,471
Huh? Why?

94
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,139
Of course it is!

95
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,558
Because it felt like one of yours!

96
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,642
I really liked it!

97
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,395
It's delicate yet powerful.

98
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,355
Let me hear it one more time! Please!

99
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,483
- Pretty please!
- No.

100
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
- Why?
- No way.

101
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,444
Please.

102
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,070
No, enough already.

103
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,989
Anyway, Naoki's not coming today.

104
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,782
Why not?

105
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,118
He said he's got a meeting
for <i>Music States.</i>

106
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,371
He's performing with Yukino Sakurai too,
so it'll run long.

107
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,540
What? They're performing together?

108
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,794
That guy is really heading down
a destructive path.

109
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,340
Like, why is he busy
writing songs for Yukino Sakurai

110
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,175
when we're the ones struggling?

111
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,219
What's he thinking?

112
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,890
- Here is your seafood curry.
- Thank you.

113
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,350
- Sure.
- I'm back.

114
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,309
Hello!

115
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,313
My plans fell through,
so I'm helping out today.

116
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,148
You are not needed.

117
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,108
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

118
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,151
I'm back!

119
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,569
- Welcome back!
- Oh!

120
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,529
Eiko?

121
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,405
I'll get started right away, Momoko.

122
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,699
- Thanks. Oh, Eiko, wait.
- Yeah?

123
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,035
- Can you get their check?
- The check?

124
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,912
That'll be 2,000 yen.

125
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,205
- 2,000.
- Exact.

126
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,206
- Yes.
- Thank you.

127
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,333
- Did you get even cuter?
- You think so?

128
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,044
- Thanks for the food.
- Thank you!

129
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,587
Thank you for coming.

130
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,924
I was looking for someone part-time
to replace you.

131
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,384
Then Eiko came along, right?

132
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,552
Best gig ever.

133
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,179
You play in a professional band now,

134
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,558
so serving curry
isn't what you should be focusing on.

135
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,977
Oh! Come in!

136
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,770
Welcome! How many people?

137
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,949
<i>MUSIC STATES</i>
PERFORMANCE

138
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,206
I guess everyone's asleep.

139
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,834
Let's go.

140
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,559
What's this?

141
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,590
Ow.

142
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,884
Akane? What are you doing here?

143
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,052
What about you?

144
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,553
This is my house.

145
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,807
Oh, that's right.

146
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,353
Were you still planning on practicing?

147
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,481
You shouldn't be coming here
on your own so late.

148
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,067
Okay.

149
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,403
Just a bit longer?

150
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,331
But I get it.

151
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,792
Nerve-racking, isn't it?

152
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,589
Are you nervous, Sensei?

153
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,591
Huh? Why?

154
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,761
Oh, never mind.

155
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,271
The world is going to meet
TENBLANK tomorrow.

156
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,523
The world?

157
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,025
Then everything will change.

158
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,029
An album release, a national tour…

159
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,948
And, of course, a place on the charts.

160
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,955
But those are all stepping stones.

161
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,915
Huh?

162
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,501
There's more scenery that lies ahead.

163
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,337
Let's all go see it together.

164
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,009
We'll probably feel nervous
and anxious each time, but…

165
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,181
But if you're here,
there is no limit to how much I can sing.

166
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,772
I feel the same.

167
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,690
If you…

168
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
If everyone's there,

169
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,653
I think we could do anything.

170
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,723
Thank you!

171
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,907
Direct the lights to the stage.

172
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,703
Whoa.

173
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,580
We'll be playing here?

174
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,211
It's unprecedented for a rookie band
to get a special stage.

175
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,382
That Yaon gig the other day was always
meant for a niche crowd of music fans.

176
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,050
Yes.

177
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,720
Listen. With today's live broadcast,
TENBLANK will--

178
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,055
Officially begin!

179
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,057
I'll do my best.

180
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,561
As long as you understand.

181
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,356
- Oh, good morning.
- Looking forward to today.

182
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,524
- Hello.
- Mr. Minamida...

183
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,985
- Nice to meet you.
- Long time no see.

184
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,112
- Good morning.
- I'm excited to work with you.

185
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,989
I'm looking forward to the finale.

186
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,575
Yes, thank you for the honor.

187
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,159
The finale…

188
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,539
Naoki came and greeted the staff earlier.

189
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,333
So morale is high with everyone.

190
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,918
Thank you.

191
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,628
Well, until then.

192
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,588
Yes, ma'am!

193
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,967
There's nothing for me to do.

194
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,942
Good morning, Ichidai.

195
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,862
Today's the big day.

196
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,657
Looks like it'll be a nice night.

197
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,079
As a trade-off for you writing Yukino's
song and performing on stage together,

198
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,166
TENBLANK gets to close the special.

199
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,336
People will be thunderstruck.

200
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,922
That the genius showed up.

201
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,593
It's a win-win arrangement for both of us.

202
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,095
A win-win.

203
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,222
Yeah.

204
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,141
Thank you.

205
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,561
Thanks to you,
our band can get off to a good start.

206
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,900
You make it sound like it's over.

207
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,323
I'd like you to keep producing
Yukino's songs going forward.

208
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,202
I always

209
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,581
simply go with
what I think is the best choice.

210
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,293
Just like you taught me.

211
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,471
How troubling.

212
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,766
Thinking we'd continue working together,

213
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,687
I put them in a good spot.

214
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,449
Excuse the intrusion.

215
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,369
TENBLANK's rehearsal is next. Thank you.

216
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,204
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

217
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,791
What? Hold on…

218
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,877
What's going on, Kazushi?

219
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,423
All the audio files are gone.

220
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,924
What?! What does that mean?

221
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,092
What about the backups?

222
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,385
All the backups too.

223
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,344
Why?!

224
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,014
That's what I'd like to know.

225
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,183
Now what? Rehearsal's starting.

226
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,027
<i>We'll recreate the data before the show.</i>

227
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,571
I'll handle the synths and rhythm for now.

228
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,824
I'll take care of the rhythm.
Sho, can you rerecord the guitar then?

229
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,783
On it.

230
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,369
We're skipping rehearsal. Sorry, Akane.

231
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,912
- Hold on a bit.
- Okay!

232
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,331
Ms. Saijo, please start getting ready.

233
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,542
- What?
- We need to maximize our time.

234
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,627
The boat on the pier is the makeup room.

235
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,338
Okay! I'll be back.

236
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,132
- Kazushi, do you have power?
- I do.

237
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,642
Excuse me.

238
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,867
Yukino Sakurai.

239
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,580
You can go ahead.

240
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,539
Sure.

241
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,543
Oh. I'm Akane Saijo of TENBLANK.

242
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,504
I know who you are.

243
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,839
Oh? Thank you so much.

244
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,719
My apologies.
I'm in a hurry, so I'll be going.

245
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,679
- Akane.
- Yes?

246
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,772
What does it feel like
playing behind everyone?

247
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:28,899
What?

248
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,324
The drummer is behind everyone, right?

249
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,963
You can see it, can't you?

250
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,173
That beautiful sight.

251
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,592
How can you be okay?

252
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,428
Be okay with what?

253
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,306
I wonder if you'll fall for him.

254
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,982
There's no need for that in music.

255
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,674
No one's here.

256
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,688
Huh?

257
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,652
Hey, Miss Ambition.

258
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,571
<i>What do you want?</i>

259
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,002
What would you play to this?

260
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:12,961
Huh?

261
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,298
Sorry. I'm busy at the moment.

262
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,051
Oh…

263
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,970
So? Think you'll fail?

264
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,556
What?

265
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,645
<i>Music States.</i>

266
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,940
You knew and still called me?

267
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:42,032
There are plenty of people in the industry
who are hoping you fail.

268
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,410
We definitely won't fail.

269
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,788
It's just a stepping stone.

270
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,347
Let's start two bars
before the pre-chorus.

271
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,265
Roger.

272
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,062
That's good. Let's keep going.

273
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,063
Okay.

274
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,983
This is a mess. There's not enough time.

275
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,153
Okay, that's good.

276
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,614
Hey, let's ask the producer.

277
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,825
Hey, Naoki.

278
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,703
- I'll change the rhythm here for the hook.
- Got it.

279
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,705
I'll play in octaves
and change the groove.

280
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,914
- Can I keep going?
- Okay.

281
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,832
Let's go.

282
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,088
That's good.

283
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,114
Fifteen minutes until the show!

284
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,866
Fifteen minutes until the show!

285
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,328
It's good!

286
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,789
Yeah!

287
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,416
It looks okay.

288
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,709
Nice.

289
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,252
Looks like we made it.

290
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,211
Yeah.

291
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,047
Where's Akane?

292
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,553
Yeah…

293
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,931
She wasn't in the makeup room either.

294
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,435
In any case, I'll check elsewhere.

295
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,354
Understood. I'll look too.

296
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,774
She wasn't there?

297
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,359
She said she didn't go to makeup.

298
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,319
Didn't go?

299
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,322
I'll look outside.

300
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,157
I'm going too.

301
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,331
Excuse me! This boat's in the frame,
so we're pulling it out.

302
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,749
Go ahead.

303
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,772
What?

304
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,357
What?!

305
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,871
Huh?

306
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,047
Anyone…

307
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,674
Is anyone out there?!

308
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,175
Anyone!

309
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,977
Five seconds until the show!

310
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,187
Four, three…

311
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,781
Good evening, everyone.

312
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:18,076
Tonight's <i>Music States</i>
is a two-hour special.

313
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,494
Excuse me!

314
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,204
Is anyone there?!

315
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,290
Excuse me!

316
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,626
Excuse me!

317
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,421
Open the door! Excuse me!

318
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,966
Don't tell me that right before.

319
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,926
Can't we bring in a substitute drummer?

320
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,386
Of course.

321
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,848
TENBLANK not going on is not an option.

322
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,392
Mr. Fujitani, it's almost time.

323
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,769
Eiko.

324
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,687
Yeah?

325
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,439
When's Akane gonna be up?

326
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,191
She's the final act.

327
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,735
Oh, what happened?

328
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,194
- Careful.
- Hold on.

329
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,530
- Be careful.
- Got too excited.

330
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,657
That's incredible.

331
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:04,623
Tonight, it's a one-night-only special
collab with Naoki Fujitani of TENBLANK,

332
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,042
the very artist who wrote "your voice."

333
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,877
Please enjoy.

334
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,548
Yukino Sakurai's new song, "your voice."

335
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,557
<i>Your low voice trails down my neck</i>

336
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,478
<i>It melts deep inside my heart</i>

337
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:30,649
<i>Take a guess at my pride</i>

338
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,277
<i>Through the champagne you just popped</i>

339
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,781
<i>My ears chase the voice</i>

340
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,368
<i>Coming from behind me in the underpass</i>

341
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,665
<i>Your eyes follow me</i>

342
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,835
<i>Making my earrings shine</i>

343
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,880
<i>Overhearing boring conversations</i>

344
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,967
<i>Let's get out of this silly room</i>

345
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,721
<i>My ears chase the voice</i>

346
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,934
<i>Behind me in the underpass</i>

347
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,938
<i>What are you looking at</i>

348
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,566
<i>As we have meaningless banter?</i>

349
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,154
<i>Hold me tight baby, I'm getting fed up</i>

350
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,991
<i>There's no point in teasing</i>

351
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:26,287
<i>Hold me tight baby</i>
<i>If your passion is real</i>

352
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,166
<i>Show me in blood tonight</i>

353
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,127
<i>Going beyond the night</i>

354
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,129
<i>And through time</i>

355
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,133
<i>To a day that elegantly vanishes</i>

356
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:42,178
<i>Will I hear your voice tomorrow too?</i>

357
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,472
<i>Try and see</i>

358
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,237
Amazing.

359
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,367
Mr. Isagi. That was incredible. Thank you.

360
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,660
Happy to hear.

361
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,412
No word from TENBLANK yet?

362
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,080
It seems not.

363
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,834
They're really gonna blow it on air?

364
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,253
- What should we do?
- Is there a sub for TENBLANK?

365
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,046
We got the okay. Should we proceed?

366
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,590
- Skip them.
- What?

367
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,799
No TENBLANK.

368
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,717
Are you sure?

369
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,010
- Yes.
- Understood.

370
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,263
Hurry up!

371
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,998
Someone!

372
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,461
Anyone!

373
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,183
<i>The world is going to meet</i>
<i>TENBLANK tomorrow.</i>

374
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,853
<i>Then everything will change.</i>

375
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,939
There's more scenery that lies ahead.

376
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,650
Let's all go see it together.

377
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,141
Sensei!

378
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,274
Oh, it's time!

379
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,905
<i>Tonight they debut</i>
<i>their hotly awaited first single.</i>

380
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,032
<i>This is "Unbroken" by TENBLANK.</i>

381
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,536
"UNBROKEN" - TENBLANK
LYRICS AND COMPOSITION BY NAOKI FUJITANI

382
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:50,760
<i>I named the flowers</i>
<i>Blooming along the winding road</i>

383
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:57,558
<i>And keep them in a silent forest</i>
<i>As bookmarks for memories</i>

384
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,312
<i>I can't say if the future</i>

385
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,564
<i>Will be vibrant and lively</i>

386
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,566
<i>But that's just fine</i>

387
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,569
<i>I don't fit in, and I can't love</i>

388
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,864
<i>But these notes wholly embraced me</i>

389
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:18,371
<i>There has to be a reason</i>

390
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:24,210
<i>Every living thing is born</i>

391
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:31,426
<i>You can't hold yourself in your own arms…</i>

392
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,887
This is TENBLANK.

393
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,390
…<i>so maybe that's why we found each other</i>

394
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:42,020
<i>Ring out your solitude</i>

395
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,189
<i>With that loneliness</i>

396
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,483
<i>Tears…</i>

397
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,776
She's smiling.

398
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,112
<i>…remain silent</i>

399
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,866
<i>The wind remains unseen</i>

400
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:59,954
<i>I will sing everything</i>

401
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,707
<i>That's been left undone</i>

402
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,092

403

TENBLANK IS GREAT!

407
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,732
Wow.

408
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,906
The music video's
about to start streaming.

409
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,699
Oh, okay!

410
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,205
Um, so, can I just hide for a little bit?

411
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,500
- What are you talking about?
- This is extremely embarrassing.

412
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,835
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'll pass too.

413
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,920
- Okay, you too.
- Hey!

414
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,421
Okay, take a seat, now.

415
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,257
This way.

416
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,050
There.

417
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,552
Well, it is a good song.

418
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,273
<i>Am I still dreaming?</i>

419
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,359
<i>I'm sure I felt it</i>

420
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,529
<i>Is there even any point</i>

421
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,950
<i>In separating dreams from reality?</i>

422
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,286
<i>In a distant melody</i>

423
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:51,209
<i>Far beyond our comprehension</i>

424
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,045
<i>The raindrops celebrate this life</i>

425
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,965
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

426
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,343
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

427
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,388
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

428
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,766
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

429
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,894
<i>The way you held your umbrella</i>

430
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,022
<i>Taught me everything about kindness</i>

431
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:17,568
<i>I hung my head and cried</i>

432
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,987
<i>Afraid you'd see through my imitation</i>

433
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,327
<i>No matter how many times…</i>

434
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,620
<i>That's what it is.</i>

435
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,373
<i>…a song was found in our love</i>

436
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,290
<i>I…</i>

437
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,835
<i>The magic that brings back to life…</i>

438
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,504
<i>I'm in love with this person.</i>

439
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,591
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

440
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,427
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

441
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,181
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

442
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,850
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

443
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,728
<i>The way your shoulders shook</i>

444
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,982
<i>Taught me everything about regret</i>

445
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,193
<i>I lost sight of what was right</i>

446
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,822
<i>And in a daze, pulled you close</i>

447
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:51,031
