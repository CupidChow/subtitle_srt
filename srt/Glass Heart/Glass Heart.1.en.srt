1
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,251
What?

2
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,753
Wait, are you firing me?

3
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:50,508
The agency said Teddy Merry
has to be dudes-only to debut.

4
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,013
Our sound is aggressive, right?

5
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,390
The band's got an image, you know?

6
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,642
I can change my image!

7
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,478
I'll dye my hair.

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,021
- Shave my brows!
- So annoying.

9
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,321
There's something I don't like
about your sound to begin with.

10
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,448
It's too heavy.

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,284
Let's go.

12
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,202
Yeah.

13
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,352
Please don't run!

14
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,397
Please don't run, it's dangerous!

15
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,328
This is an announcement
from the organizers.

16
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,165
Due to bad weather,
we must cancel today's live concert.

17
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,583
What?!

18
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,502
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry!

19
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,545
Bullshit!

20
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,091
To everyone who came,
please be careful as you leave.

21
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,511
Please walk slowly
without pushing those in front of you.

22
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,763
The floor is slippery, so be careful.

23
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,931
Hurry up!

24
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,100
- Please walk slowly.
- Hey, let's go.

25
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,644
Please be careful and keep moving forward.

26
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,855
There's no problem in walking slowly…

27
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,815
Please walk straight to the exit.

28
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,858
Please don't run.

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,192
Slowly, please.

30
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,583
The exit is that way.

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,502
Please watch your step.

32
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,093
Walk slowly without running.

33
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,700
That girl is crazy.

34
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,870
<i>There was only sound there.</i>

35
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,171
<i>The rain, the scenery…</i>

36
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,092
<i>and even me.</i>

37
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,305
<i>The boundaries between everything blurred,</i>

38
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,099
<i>and I realized</i>

39
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:14,522
<i>I was born to meet this sound.</i>

40
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,153
<i>I'm sure this sound…</i>

41
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,126
<i>was a gift from the gods.</i>

42
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,605
BAND MEMBERS WANTED!

43
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,955
Okay, that's good. Thank you.

44
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,500
That's enough. Thank you very much.

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,795
Well, that's all for today's audition.

46
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,756
We'll contact you later with the result.

47
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,644
I'm back.

48
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,645
Welcome back.

49
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,739
GRAB YOUR DREAM

50
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,011
Hello?

51
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>Is this Akane Saijo?</i>

52
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,517
<i>Thank you for coming to our audition</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

53
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,103
Yes.

54
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,147
<i>Well, let's see.</i>

55
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,400
<i>Unfortunately, we can't accept you</i>
<i>this time.</i>

56
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,820
Huh?

57
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>If you'll excuse me.</i>

58
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,365
Excuse me.

59
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,659
AUDITION: LAST CHANCE
MUST PASS!!!

60
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,286
What was wrong with me?

61
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,038
<i>Well…</i>

62
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,128
<i>Your drumming can't see its surroundings.</i>

63
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,964
<i>It lacks sensitivity.</i>

64
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,426
<i>Okay, then.</i>

65
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,659
Hello, this is Vermilion.

66
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,249
Akane, can I ask you to do a delivery?

67
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,295
Sure.

68
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,677
Here. They specifically requested
that you deliver this.

69
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,180
- They requested me?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,518
Oh, right. Listen.

71
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,354
I heard from one
of my fellow writer friends

72
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,191
that Sho Takaoka is forming a band.

73
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,276
Huh? With who?

74
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,320
Naoki Fujitani.

75
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,614
Naoki Fujitani?

76
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,493
That guy who was struck by lightning
at the festival three years ago.

77
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,330
Nobody knew where he went after that
so I wondered how he was doing,

78
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,083
but who would have thought
he would be forming a band.

79
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,631
Is something wrong?

80
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,174
Huh?

81
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,175
Huh?

82
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,055
- You know…
- Yes?

83
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,728
I failed the audition, after all.

84
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,315
Right.

85
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,032
Thank you for supporting me
so much until now.

86
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,786
Are you giving up?

87
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,997
Yes.

88
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,957
I had decided today was the last one.

89
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,835
Are you sure?

90
00:09:59,015 --> 00:09:59,890
You know, I…

91
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,480
I gave it my all these three years.

92
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,774
Yeah.

93
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,652
That's why…

94
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,034
I have no regrets.

95
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,415
I see.

96
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,553
<i>Even now, at this very moment,</i>

97
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,598
<i>many new sounds are being born,</i>

98
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,935
<i>and many people are taking them in.</i>

99
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>The dream that has been</i>
<i>ringing in my heart</i>

100
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>is about to disappear</i>
<i>without anyone knowing.</i>

101
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,979
Excuse me.

102
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,289
Huh?

103
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,457
Is that my name?

104
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,376
Why?

105
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,086
What?

106
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,243
TO AKANE SAIJO:
I'M BUSY WITH SOMETHING, SO PLEASE COME IN

107
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,492
<i>I've been searching for this sound</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

108
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,749
<i>I've longed for this sound.</i>

109
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,504
<i>The sound…</i>

110
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,757
<i>I kept looking for…</i>

111
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>is now…</i>

112
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,411
Who are you?

113
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,371
Oh, the curry…

114
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,083
Sho Takaoka.

115
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
Yes?

116
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,630
Oh, I'm not someone suspicious!

117
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,131
I came to deliver curry!

118
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,382
I see, it's you.

119
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,927
Naoki.

120
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,678
Mr. Naoki Fujitani.

121
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,264
Sho Takaoka is forming a band.

122
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,475
Huh? With who?

123
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,560
<i>Naoki Fujitani.</i>

124
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:41,482
<i>The Amadeus of the rock industry</i>
<i>who debuted as a composer at 14 years old.</i>

125
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,692
Oh, we've lost him.

126
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,319
He won't hear a word now.

127
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,914
What's that? It wasn't that kind of song.

128
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,123
Oh, you didn't like it?

129
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,084
But then, the keyboards won't work.

130
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,710
Yeah. That's why…

131
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,638
- Well?
- I see.

132
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,723
Well,

133
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,350
in that case.

134
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,775
You can go crazier, Kazushi.

135
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,029
Crazier.

136
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,913
Sho!

137
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,831
What?

138
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,541
- To finish…
- Yeah?

139
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,712
Just for four bars, cover it
with a 0.2-millimeter thin veil.

140
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,755
Like a lemon-flavored candy,
not too sweet.

141
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,424
Oh, okay.

142
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,856
- Nice.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

143
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,399
What about the drums?

144
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,450
Like this, I think.

145
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,248
<i>Four sounds that should never have met.</i>

146
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:27,171
<i>The mysterious and elusive genius</i>

147
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,964
<i>behind countless hit songs,</i>

148
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549
<i>Naoki Fujitani.</i>

149
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,262
<i>A top-tier support guitarist</i>
<i>for superbands in Japan and abroad,</i>

150
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,555
<i>Sho Takaoka.</i>

151
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:41,185
<i>The music maverick</i>
<i>who went viral as a lone track maker,</i>

152
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,686
<i>Kazushi Sakamoto.</i>

153
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,816
<i>And me, an unknown drummer</i>
<i>on the verge of a broken dream,</i>

154
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,109
<i>Akane Saijo.</i>

155
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,488
<i>Led by Naoki Fujitani,</i>

156
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:57,618
<i>four sounds have come together</i>
<i>and now begin to play a single story.</i>

157
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,664
Well, that's it for today. Thank you.

158
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,756
Hey!

159
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,591
Just how sleepy are you?

160
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,177
You were sleeping like a log in class,

161
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,471
which must mean
that you were out last night.

162
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,390
Yeah, they didn't let me sleep all night.

163
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,601
What?

164
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,937
My body hurts everywhere.

165
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,396
Hold up, Akane.

166
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,732
That's a world far too adult.

167
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,529
How can they so casually dump
whatever they say "won't work"?

168
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,364
Oh, a smash-and-dash?

169
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,324
The song we wrote.

170
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,409
- Huh?
- Huh?

171
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,122
What? You got invited
to join Sho Takaoka's band?

172
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,540
Yeah.

173
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,170
Huh? Why you?

174
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:51,922
I don't know.

175
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,595
Well, that must mean someone was watching
how hard you've been working.

176
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,139
Yeah.

177
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,851
So, what kind of person is
that Naoki Fujitani?

178
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,644
What kind?

179
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,439
- Huh?
- What?

180
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,697
Excuse me.

181
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,159
Oh.

182
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,785
It's Akane.

183
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,036
Where are you going?

184
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,497
Where? I'm on my way
to help with the café.

185
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,790
Is that urgent?

186
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,834
Huh?

187
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,502
This is so interesting.

188
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,379
I picked it up earlier.

189
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,561
Right?

190
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,482
You're right!

191
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,070
Um…

192
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,198
Hey.

193
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,158
Where are we going?

194
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,661
Oh, right.

195
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:48,997
Sorry.

196
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,375
I'm no good.

197
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,920
Right now, my head was in composer mode.

198
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,507
Once this happens, my memory blurs.

199
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:04,096
Ordinary stuff, common sense…
everything becomes so difficult.

200
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,181
Must be hard on you.

201
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,022
Welcome.

202
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,733
Hello.

203
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,235
I'm Kai, the manager.

204
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,319
Nice to meet you.

205
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,699
Hey, Miyako, this is Akane Saijo,
who will play the drums with us--

206
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,825
Of course not.

207
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,746
The agency knew Fujitani on vocals
and Takaoka on guitar

208
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,456
would generate plenty of buzz.

209
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,918
The plan was to rely on backing tracks
or session musicians.

210
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,796
But you went and forced Kazushi
into the mix.

211
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,716
Still, we said marketing him
as a "rising star"

212
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,969
and the group as a three-man band
could also work.

213
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:48,348
It's how we finally got
the record label on board with it.

214
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,977
Now you want to tell them
you're adding a total amateur girl?

215
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,981
The concept, the project, and everything
will have to be redone from scratch.

216
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,317
Is that the only problem?

217
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,696
Did you really hear what I just said?

218
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,780
I really did.

219
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,325
But listen,
with the agency's current strategy,

220
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,328
I'm saying we'll only sell
"moderately well" at best.

221
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,539
That's why I'm preparing in my own way,
to make sure we blow up big.

222
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,583
I know that I'm not wrong.

223
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,960
I understand what you want to say, Naoki.

224
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,464
Telling the big shots, "Don't worry,
I'm confident," won't cut it.

225
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,883
Anyone can say what they want.

226
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,970
So we just need to show results.

227
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,476
Yeah. Nice. Let's do that.

228
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,355
Huh?

229
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,316
Hey, wait, please!

230
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:41,943
Ms. Saijo.

231
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,445
Yes?

232
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,156
Let me just say one thing.

233
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,620
The sound of a genius
brings misery to ordinary people.

234
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,215
- What?
- The concert is in a week, okay?

235
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,675
Hey, Sensei, just wait a moment.

236
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,636
That's different from the original plan.

237
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,763
What was the original plan?

238
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,517
Um…

239
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,060
Well, whatever.

240
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,189
But why do we suddenly have to play

241
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,525
on an outdoor stage
in front of 3,000 people?

242
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,486
I happened to come across
a last-minute booking at the Yaon,

243
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,404
right before my eyes.

244
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,781
Pretty shit gig, if you ask me.

245
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,074
Do you think so?

246
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,035
I mean, opening for OVER CHROME?
Are you for real?

247
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,913
And in just a week? That's impossible.

248
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,706
What about the songs?

249
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,750
This is the song.

250
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,794
Here.

251
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:42,963
Yours.

252
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,714
You too, Akane.

253
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,094
I'll finish one more song quickly
and bring it to the rehearsal.

254
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,846
- You guys prep for the show.
- But--

255
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,514
You may be fine, but…

256
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,975
what about her?

257
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,954
Stop.

258
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,290
The sound is too rigid. Again.

259
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,500
Stop.

260
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,043
One more time.

261
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,759
Okay.

262
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,640
That's mine.

263
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,309
Sorry.

264
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,062
Surely, if a cup is this distinct,

265
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,898
you'd assume it's not yours to use.

266
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,399
I'm sorry.

267
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,367
I'm sorry for the wait.

268
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,661
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

269
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,622
What?

270
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,540
Okay.

271
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,668
Yes. I'm sorry.

272
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,220
Good.

273
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,311
When he's focused,
he doesn't even notice the temperature.

274
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,896
I see.

275
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,192
Are you talking about the fourth bar here?

276
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,027
Yes, don't bounce there.

277
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,904
Like figure skating, keep an edge.

278
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,947
Of course.

279
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,950
Akane, you added some arrangements
to that part, right?

280
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,992
What? Did I really?

281
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,786
Yes, it was different from the music.

282
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,996
But that was better. So play your version.

283
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,844
- Incredible. That was so cool.
- Wow!

284
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,554
You must be a pro.

285
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,555
Oh, no.

286
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,934
Oh…

287
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,146
Here you go.

288
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,486
I've never heard
such a cool version of "Für Elise."

289
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:36,905
Thanks.

290
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,406
You're amazing, Kazushi.

291
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,534
Sensei and Sho are truly amazing as well.

292
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,996
You all completely change
when you play your instruments.

293
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,458
You all feel beyond my reach right now.

294
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,254
I totally agree with you.

295
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:55,882
What?

296
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,010
Your sound lacks sensitivity.

297
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,055
It drags around the surrounding sounds.

298
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,726
A drummer unaware of their surroundings?
That's fatal.

299
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,568
If you feel we're beyond your reach,

300
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,114
then step down. Please.

301
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,372
I…

302
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,000
don't like your sound.

303
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,724
NAOKI

304
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,661
<i>Yeah, this is the brand-new era</i>

305
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,290
<i>Yeah, what do you wanna scream?</i>
<i>Come on</i>

306
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:15,336
<i>Kick up a fuss and switch it up</i>
<i>Disastrous, it's a furious turbulence</i>

307
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,050
<i>Play a deep, deep, deep and killer tune</i>
<i>Ignite a mental fire like a fool</i>

308
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,553
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Dummies all around me</i>

309
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,889
<i>Be crazy, crazy!</i>
<i>It's our brand-new era</i>

310
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,974
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Expose the dark around me</i>

311
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,227
<i>I don't need no love or dreams, okay?</i>

312
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:35,106
<i>Now shake off any doubt</i>

313
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,694
<i>Ain't no good or evil here</i>

314
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,612
<i>With your…</i>

315
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,529
Sensei.

316
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,407
<i>…turn the dark to radiance</i>

317
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:51,289
<i>Embrace the voice you always believed in</i>

318
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,168
<i>Hey, turbulence</i>
<i>Get me, get me higher!</i>

319
00:29:55,752 --> 00:30:00,089
<i>I'm looking through the shadows for a sign</i>
<i>The memories I ripped from my mind</i>

320
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,677
<i>You who felt the same pain, been maligned</i>
<i>Stand together now and bring the fight</i>

321
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,349
<i>Kick up a fuss and switch it up</i>
<i>Disastrous, it's a furious turbulence</i>

322
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:14,938
<i>Play a deep, deep, deep and killer tune</i>
<i>Ignite a mental fire like a fool</i>

323
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,148
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Dummies all around me</i>

324
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,734
<i>Be crazy, crazy!</i>
<i>It's our brand-new era</i>

325
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,403
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Expose the dark around me</i>

326
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,281
<i>Give it to me</i>
<i>I'll devour your scream</i>

327
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,509
Great work tonight.

328
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,765
Toya, don't bring trouble here, please.

329
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,809
He's the one causing it.

330
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,565
What? Are you planning to disrupt
our Yaon show?

331
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,485
But you said okay, right?
Thanks, I'm looking forward to it.

332
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:07,866
Sure. So you're not going to complain
even if OVER CHROME wrecks you guys, huh?

333
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,535
That's fine.
Fans will stick with whoever they like.

334
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,332
But I have no intention
of fighting with you, Toya.

335
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,836
It just happens to be like that this time.

336
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,505
I just

337
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,011
want to play my own music.

338
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,515
You can easily do that.

339
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,976
You alone are enough.

340
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,563
Stop playing these boring band games.

341
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,150
I don't want to.

342
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,490
Hey, you.

343
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,451
What? Yes.

344
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,994
Are you confident?

345
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,913
What?

346
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,917
Guarantee that his music
won't be destroyed because of you.

347
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,878
I'm asking if you have that resolve.

348
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,297
Answer me.

349
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,721
You can't answer me.

350
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,433
No.

351
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,103
That's not true.

352
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,567
It's true
that I don't have confidence right now.

353
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,778
But…

354
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,572
I have ambition.

355
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,823
Huh?

356
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:37,580
I mean, music is just sound
created in a moment.

357
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,959
So about the guarantee
and my determination--

358
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,002
Huh?

359
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,587
Whatever.

360
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,048
We'll completely wreck you guys.

361
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,476
Excuse me.

362
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,311
Sensei.

363
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:38,891
Hello.

364
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,019
<i>Oh, Akane? It's me, Sho.</i>

365
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,687
Yes.

366
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,315
<i>Naoki isn't back.</i>
<i>Do you know where he went?</i>

367
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,902
It's true
that I don't have confidence right now.

368
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,072
Huh?

369
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,699
<i>Hello?</i>

370
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,328
I might have made him angry.

371
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,039
<i>Huh?</i>

372
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,626
Because I couldn't say I was confident.

373
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,317
Sensei!

374
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,917
Sensei, are you okay?

375
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,257
Sensei, are you okay?

376
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,424
Sensei.

377
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,093
Sensei!

378
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,303
Sensei.

379
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,055
- Are you--
- Wow, I got it.

380
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,354
Oh, wait. It's Akane.
What are you doing here?

381
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,024
What are <i>you </i>doing at a place like this?

382
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,364
What?

383
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,710
A song has been floating around
in my head recently.

384
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,380
I just completed it. Even the arrangement.

385
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,299
It's a masterpiece.

386
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,052
I thought I might die
and leave this piece as my final work.

387
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,141
So you weren't angry?

388
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,101
Why?

389
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,606
Wait, did you just forget
what happened before and after?

390
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,774
Oh…

391
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,069
I might have.

392
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,697
I went to Toya's concert today.

393
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,490
Wait.

394
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,702
Why am I with you, Akane?

395
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,918
What a relief.

396
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,298
I'm sorry.

397
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,721
About Miyako.

398
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,349
And Toya as well.

399
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,938
They have no idea about your sound.

400
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,940
They only talk about what is external.

401
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,318
Like your position, age, and career.

402
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,781
Those are powerless
against the actual sound we make.

403
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,283
For me,

404
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,662
if such bias gets in our way,

405
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,665
I'd rather make an even bolder move

406
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,125
and shake up what's conventional.

407
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:43,135
But… I'm glad you have ambition.

408
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,140
So you do remember.

409
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,228
That's good enough for now.

410
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,898
Someday in the future,
tell me you're confident.

411
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,235
We'll definitely

412
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,779
achieve something amazing.

413
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,618
Yes.

414
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,672
Wow, that was impressive.

415
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,383
A relentlessly provoking,
sadistic drum beat.

416
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,389
Akane brought us that sound.

417
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,729
- Sensei!
- What?

418
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,568
Is he okay?

419
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,780
He's okay.

420
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,871
Open the door, Kazushi.

421
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,831
Thanks.

422
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,425
<i>Naoki.</i>

423
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,427
<i>Listen to me, Naoki.</i>

424
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,514
<i>I won't let you leave me.</i>

425
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,392
I said to wait!

426
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,485
Are you doing okay, Akane?

427
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,571
Yes. I'm totally fine.

428
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,492
You're tough and cool.

429
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,745
It's like my only strength.

430
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,585
That day,

431
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,298
<i>your drumming made it resonate again.</i>

432
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,927
<i>I hadn't even realized it had been broken.</i>

433
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,098
<i>The precious sound inside me</i>
<i>that had gone silent.</i>

434
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,019
<i>Some sounds can't be made alone.</i>

435
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,730
<i>That's the sound I'm searching for.</i>

436
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,984
<i>That's why I went to see Sho.</i>

437
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,862
<i>And I found Kazushi.</i>

438
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,115
<i>I searched for you, Akane.</i>

439
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,790
I was called

440
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,169
by your sound.

441
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,225
The instruments are ready.

442
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,810
On in five.

443
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,936
Okay.

444
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,146
OPENING ACT: FUJITANI BAND

445
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,315
Band members, standby.

446
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,026
Akane,

447
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,236
let's do it.

448
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,196
Yes.

449
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,050
Oh my gosh. I'm super excited.

450
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,341
- Huh?
- Who's that?

451
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,843
- There's an opening act today?
- Never heard of them.

452
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,345
Who is it?

453
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,097
A new band? We don't need you.

454
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,224
Wait. Isn't that Sho Takaoka?

455
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,351
Why is he here? Just helping out?

456
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,563
- What?
- It's a surprise.

457
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,066
What the hell?

458
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,194
You look like a corpse.

459
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,573
Oh, it's Toya. You look cool as usual.

460
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,118
At the very least, act cool.

461
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,870
Otherwise, it's no fun wrecking you guys.

462
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,707
I got it.

463
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,086
Just watch.

464
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,758
I'll turn it into a legendary performance.

465
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,429
Who just came?

466
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,055
It's Mr. Isagi, the producer.

467
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,732
Excuse me. May I check your pass?

468
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,317
No, no. It's okay.

469
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,776
- Forgive us.
- This way, please.

470
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,779
Actually, today,
I'll be watching from the audience.

471
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,697
What?

472
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,700
It's my precious friend's
first live performance.

473
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,869
Then this way, please.

474
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,495
Please.

475
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,331
Is OVER CHROME not coming out yet?

476
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,082
Get Mahiro out! Mahiro!

477
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,125
Toya!

478
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,003
- The drummer seems out of place.
- Can you really play?

479
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,382
I told you this was going to happen.

480
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,344
Get OVER CHROME on stage now!

481
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,512
How long are you making us wait?

482
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,222
Enough already.

483
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,350
- We didn't ask for you.
- Go home!

484
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,769
Come on. OVER CHROME!

485
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:14,735
<i>The fear of not being wanted by anyone.</i>

486
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:23,494
<i>It is similar to the fear I have felt</i>
<i>since I started playing music.</i>

487
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,307
<i>But I'm not afraid anymore.</i>

488
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,268
<i>Because I know</i>

489
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,939
<i>that I was wanted</i>

490
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,858
<i>by his sound.</i>

491
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,027
Nice to meet you guys. We're TENBLANK.

492
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,155
TENBLANK…

493
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:05,994
On guitar,

494
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,871
Sho Takaoka.

495
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,374
On keyboard,

496
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,668
Kazushi Sakamoto.

497
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,630
On drums,

498
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,465
Akane Saijo.

499
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,719
On bass and vocals…

500
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,389
Naoki Fujitani.

501
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:32,034
