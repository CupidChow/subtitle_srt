1
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,192
Hello?

2
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:28,820
Yeah.

3
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,452
Huh?

4
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,746
Yeah, so?

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,206
Uh-huh.

6
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,209
Like I said, I'm not looking
to team up with anyone.

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,588
I'm not cut out
to stick with the same people forever.

8
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,473
That was fire.

9
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,434
Excuse me. Sorry.

10
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,561
Wait up!

11
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,693
Oh, my bad.

12
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,486
Well, I…

13
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,197
I play the guitar.

14
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,742
Oh, sorry, it's sudden.

15
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,580
I know it's out of nowhere, but…

16
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,335
wanna start a band with me?

17
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,464
Sorry.

18
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,675
Huh?

19
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,343
I'm just not cut out for that.

20
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,470
Sorry.

21
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,181
Wait…

22
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,021
Ouch.

23
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,690
Rejected.

24
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,066
No.

25
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,317
Good morning.

26
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,612
That sounded like you were just lost.

27
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,571
Cut it out.

28
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:07,205
Then just tell me exactly what you want.
I'll play it however you say.

29
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,832
Hey, Sho.

30
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,336
How long have you been playing guitar?
Aren't you embarrassed?

31
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,921
More than embarrassment,

32
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,840
I don't want to deal with you
the way you are now.

33
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,177
Sensei.

34
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,764
You need a break. Just 30 minutes.

35
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,682
No.

36
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,060
If we stop now, it's back to square one.

37
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,729
Do it again.

38
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,816
Okay, playing it back.

39
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,775
Okay.

40
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,412
Has Sensei not eaten anything again?

41
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,626
It's probably both exhaustion and nerves.

42
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:59,090
He's been throwing up
anything he tries to eat since last night.

43
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,551
Again.

44
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,472
I couldn't let it go,
so I tried reaching out to venues.

45
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,392
But it was a total bust.

46
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,397
I know he's doing everything he can, but

47
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,276
if he keeps pushing himself like this,
he's gonna fall apart.

48
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,737
Off again.

49
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,865
I don't need that kind of sound.

50
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,327
How off are we talking?

51
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,833
Like the distance between us.

52
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,670
Where exactly am I?
And where exactly are you?

53
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,343
Can't you

54
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,221
even understand
something that simple anymore?

55
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,222
Seriously?

56
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,685
Hey, you can hate me all you want,
but not the song!

57
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,064
Love this song.

58
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,026
Don't play it like it's a set of notes!
Play it with your own sound!

59
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,528
I've been doing that all along!

60
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,242
This song is amazing, and you're a genius.

61
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,536
A damn genius.

62
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,914
Stop saying things like that!

63
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,708
I don't give a damn about myself!

64
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,210
Just think about this song!

65
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,338
- You and this song are one and the same!
- No, no, no!

66
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,757
I'm telling you, you don't need me!

67
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,554
I gave it to you
because I want you to break it.

68
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,393
I'm begging you,
stop asking me what to do.

69
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,144
Do whatever the hell you want.

70
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,623
I get what you're trying to say.

71
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,962
But will you hear me out too?

72
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,674
What?

73
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:15,226
No matter what you say,
this song is yours.

74
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,147
And that's exactly what I love about it.

75
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,610
That's why I can't just toss you aside
and turn it into just another song.

76
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,195
Honestly, that's the one thing

77
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,282
I can't compromise on.

78
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,742
Do you get it?

79
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,090
Then tell me.

80
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,011
Sho, you…

81
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,267
can't you ever break something
because you love it?

82
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,605
I can.

83
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,361
Is that what you want to see, Naoki?

84
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,575
Yeah.

85
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,329
Do it.

86
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,497
Let me hear that.

87
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,771
Okay, starting from the same spot.

88
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,772
Hold on!

89
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,669
Sorry, I'm ready. Let's do this.

90
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,963
Here we go.

91
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:32,989
Okay.

92
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,907
Let me use that take.

93
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,083
Thank you.

94
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,634
Akane, get that door.

95
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,720
Huh? Oh.

96
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,268
So what's your pick?
Food, confinement, or a hospital IV?

97
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,894
- Hey, Sho.
- Yeah?

98
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,147
Before that, can I go throw up
one more time?

99
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,983
- What's fun about puking up stomach acid?
- Sho.

100
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:09,900
What?

101
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,069
You must be exhausted too,
playing nonstop.

102
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,155
Go rest. I'll take care of him.

103
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,489
That's exactly why.

104
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,449
Huh?

105
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,038
I went through the most,
so I deserve to take care of him.

106
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,827
You went too far, Ichidai.

107
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,167
Welcome home, Naoki.

108
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,428
Listen, this is all for you.

109
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,057
Canceling the tour
was also all for your sake.

110
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,934
You understand, don't you?

111
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,480
Come back where you belong.

112
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,483
I'm begging you, let's do it together!
It's your last chance!

113
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,610
I can't.

114
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,364
What I do and the music you make
have drifted too far apart.

115
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,573
I…

116
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,077
I know that deep down,
we're still connected!

117
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,330
I believe we share the same soul!

118
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,420
That's why I…

119
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,590
I've always been lonely.

120
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,971
So lonely.

121
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,725
The studio feels unbearable.

122
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,688
I keep thinking, if only you were here.

123
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,649
What you create isn't my music.

124
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,818
It's your own music.

125
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,784
I'm sad too.

126
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,037
But that's just how it is.

127
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,501
So let me hear your music.

128
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,551
Akane.

129
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,972
Oh, I interrupted. I'm sorry.

130
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,765
Keep talking. About anything.

131
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,520
Chant a spell even.

132
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,522
Huh? Why?

133
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,440
Hearing your voice…

134
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,612
helps me make progress.

135
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,002
Kazushi.

136
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,765
Listen.

137
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,018
I…

138
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,708
Huh?

139
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,547
- Whoa!
- Oh no.

140
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,132
Damn it.

141
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,802
I just came up with a new sound again.

142
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,055
Huh?

143
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,099
Oh, it's Kazushi.

144
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,231
Please, stop picking up anything
and everything like it's worth keeping.

145
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,776
There's no sound around me
I consider unnecessary.

146
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,236
I know!

147
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,406
I'll play a rough version,
and will you remember it?

148
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,328
I'd rather not be treated
like an external hard drive. It's a pain.

149
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,790
You pick up the nuances,
so you're more reliable than a recording.

150
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,836
God, you're seriously a hassle.

151
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,716
I don't have time,
so let's get this over with.

152
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,889
Oh, welcome back.

153
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,730
Huh?

154
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,690
Wait!

155
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,149
Why the hell did you…

156
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:26,860
Oh.

157
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,531
So you found out.

158
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,410
Hey!

159
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,387
What are you doing?

160
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,143
I'm leaving TENBLANK.

161
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,854
- What?!
- I don't…

162
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,566
I can't play with you anymore.

163
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,903
That would mean TENBLANK falls apart.

164
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,781
- That's basically disbanding.
- Then quit.

165
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,949
No way. Don't quit.

166
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,367
You think this is a joke?!

167
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,828
If you keep playing like this,
you're gonna die!

168
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,955
Do you even get that?!

169
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,628
I just want to hear you play your guitar.

170
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,174
We can understand each other
much better that way.

171
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,727
Hey…

172
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,447
Sensei.

173
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,574
What Sho just said…

174
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,201
I'm sorry.

175
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,953
You're probably pretty confused,

176
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,373
but if I say anymore, I may cry.

177
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,526
What are you doing?!

178
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,279
Don't treat us like outsiders.
Explain it to us.

179
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,180
At this rate,

180
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,724
Naoki doesn't have much time left.

181
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,646
<i>They found out after the accident.</i>

182
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,818
The CT scan showed a tumor in his brain.

183
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,906
He must have had symptoms like dizziness,
headaches, and blurred vision.

184
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,951
<i>He disappeared from my life,</i>

185
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,579
but I thought he was getting treatment.

186
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,872
I was wrong.

187
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,500
With a body like that,

188
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,920
it's impossible for him
to keep performing music.

189
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,259
Let alone being in a band.

190
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,055
If he keeps going like this…

191
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,018
he's going to die.

192
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,029
We have to make him rest.

193
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,948
We'll separate him from music.

194
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,953
Separate him from music?

195
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,663
You've seen it yourself.

196
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,042
How much of his life
he poured into this band.

197
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,045
How he pushes himself
just to write a song.

198
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,758
If it's for him…

199
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,428
I'll leave TENBLANK.

200
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,940
I won't let him keep making music
in that condition.

201
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,275
For now,

202
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,737
we'll have him stay in his room.

203
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,198
Yeah?

204
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,326
<i>Well, regarding the performers,</i>

205
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,371
<i>I was told by a few artists</i>
<i>that their schedules wouldn't work.</i>

206
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,538
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

207
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,250
That's the best you can do?

208
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,587
They're fired.

209
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,923
Drop anyone
who won't perform at the festival.

210
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,591
Just crush them.

211
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,510
<i>Understood.</i>

212
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,848
Oh, look who's here.

213
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,273
What do you think you're doing?

214
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,901
What? You're the one who called me here.

215
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,237
The first festival in three years.

216
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,822
You're performing.

217
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,865
A festival? You're doing it again?

218
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,867
I'm making history.

219
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,121
And this time, I'll take it to a level
beyond comparison.

220
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,959
Oh, you're already making history.

221
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,588
The history of pure scumbaggery!

222
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,019
Your beloved Naoki Fujitani?

223
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,062
I crushed him.

224
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,983
He and his band will never perform again.

225
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,485
Because of Naoki's illness,

226
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,613
TENBLANK will disband.

227
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,742
Disband?

228
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,286
TENBLANK is nothing
but a relic of the past.

229
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,665
Once this festival becomes a success,
my era will be solidified.

230
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,424
That guy believes in music.

231
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,137
So do I.

232
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,579
What are you doing here?

233
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,332
I…

234
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,794
I didn't notice at all.

235
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,504
Why?

236
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,924
You're not the only one.

237
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,264
Naoki…

238
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,893
He should end TENBLANK.

239
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,523
It's the only logical choice.

240
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,651
If he keeps going and suddenly collapses--

241
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,777
I know.

242
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,572
I know, but…

243
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,079
I know it.

244
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,261
Sorry.

245
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,722
I'll be fine.

246
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,267
Don't worry about me.

247
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,043
It's okay.

248
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,297
Stay here as long as you want.

249
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,654
It's freezing out here, you know.

250
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,995
If you collapse too,
that would be seriously stupid.

251
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,342
Actually…

252
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,516
I used to be the kind of person
who felt most at ease alone.

253
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,565
But now, day in and day out,
morning and night,

254
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,608
I'm surrounded

255
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,153
by these loud, wild, overwhelming guys.

256
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,370
Somehow that became my life.

257
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,586
And before I knew it,

258
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,342
TENBLANK had become my shelter.

259
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,435
Same for me.

260
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,202
I don't want to accept…

261
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,875
that the four of us
can't make music together anymore.

262
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,588
Yeah.

263
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,548
It'd be unbearable…

264
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,302
to not be able to hear
Sensei's song up close.

265
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,933
But…

266
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,938
losing him…

267
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,193
would be even more unbearable.

268
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:29,833
Hey.

269
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,044
Do you remember

270
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,547
that day?

271
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,894
- Hey, Sho, you sure?
- Yeah.

272
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,813
Your talent is wasted
as a session musician.

273
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,773
Sorry, I really appreciate the offer.

274
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,569
Okay, then. How about this?

275
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,239
Black or red, which one?

276
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,991
Huh?

277
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,661
If you guess the color of my socks today,
I'll give up.

278
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,456
But if you're wrong,
you're officially joining Z-OUT.

279
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,418
Which one?

280
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,093
Red.

281
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,554
Red for me too!

282
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,850
- You're Naoki Fujit--
- If it's red, let's do it.

283
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:30,894
Form a band with me.

284
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,437
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

285
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,522
- Why now, all of a sudden?
- Play your guitar.

286
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,650
Play for me.

287
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,863
I've got work--

288
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,034
Ta-da!

289
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,414
Ta-da!

290
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,208
What?

291
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,129
Well, since I played dirty,
I'll let it go.

292
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,924
Wait, hold on, Rage!

293
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,433
You're being way too selfish.

294
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,439
Let's play at the festival.

295
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,525
I won't, and I'm not joining a band.

296
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,318
And stop asking me.

297
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,154
But you reached out to me first.

298
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,155
That was…

299
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,909
a moment of weakness.

300
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,420
I've decided to stick
to being a session musician.

301
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,258
Why are you suddenly changing your mind?

302
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,848
Hey, can I bum a cigarette?

303
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,140
I'll pay you back later.

304
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,809
Oh, you smoke?

305
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,269
I don't.

306
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,070
I think I just admire it.
The whole unknown world.

307
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:07,991
I…

308
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,995
I've never been good
at making music with others.

309
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,374
But I wanted to break free
from that broken version of myself.

310
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,877
That's why I pinned my hopes on you.

311
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,557
You're Naoki Fujitani.

312
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,644
There must be tons of people
who want to be in a band with you.

313
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,859
You're the only one.

314
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,235
Huh?

315
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,821
You're the only one
who's ever asked straight-up.

316
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,035
The only person in the entire world.

317
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,126
That's right.

318
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,718
I asked you to join a band.

319
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,782
I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

320
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,395
KAWAGOE HIKAWA SHRINE

321
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,570
<i>Please</i>

322
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,199
<i>save Sensei.</i>

323
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:42,038
<i>I'll do whatever it takes for that.</i>

324
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,583
<i>Even if…</i>

325
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,543
MAY SENSEI'S ILLNESS BE CURED

326
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,296
<i>…it means taking music away from him.</i>

327
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,925
<i>So be it</i>

328
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,303
<i>if it keeps him alive.</i>

329
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,101
GOD, THANK YOU
FOR LEADING ME TO TENBLANK

330
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,002
Oh, it's Akane.

331
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,966
Sensei.

332
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,350
You're someone…

333
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,897
who'd die if you couldn't make music.

334
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,070
That's why…

335
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,242
you chose us, didn't you?

336
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,459
Sensei.

337
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,632
Use my sound.

338
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,930
Every note inside me.

339
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,186
I give them all to you.

340
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,123
Hey, Naoki!

341
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,679
Naoki?

342
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,223
Hey, Akane!

343
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,332
<i>I can hear, so close,</i>

344
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,502
<i>the sound of you living, Sensei.</i>

345
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,130
<i>The music inside me,</i>

346
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,800
<i>I'll devote it all to you.</i>

347
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,347
<i>So I won't hesitate anymore.</i>

348
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,767
<i>This sound,</i>

349
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,853
<i>this warmth…</i>

350
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,067
<i>is risking everything to find the answer.</i>

351
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,529
<i>All that's left is to run ahead.</i>
