1
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>There are no wrong notes</i>

2
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,654
<i>You never say anything</i>

3
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,533
<i>Even though you always ask "why?"</i>

4
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,756
NAOKI FUJITANI
DONE

5
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,306
He finished his song.

6
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,896
You're not gonna listen?

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,790
They're probably at Naoki's cabin now.

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,793
Let's go pick them up.

9
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,587
I don't give a damn.

10
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,261
Then maybe I'll go.

11
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,473
Because I do.

12
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,830
What? Weren't you going to go?

13
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,461
I reconsidered.

14
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,348
As a member of TENBLANK,

15
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,854
I should be with the person
having the toughest time.

16
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,731
"The toughest time"? Me?

17
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,600
Sensei!

18
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,810
Sensei!

19
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,106
Sensei!

20
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,817
Sensei!

21
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,363
Sensei!

22
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,926
We hope you join us
in making Japan's biggest rock festival…

23
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,719
- Finish before the meeting.
- Got it.

24
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,804
Yes, this is Uto.

25
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,979
Yes, if Ishikawa Pharma could sponsor…

26
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,105
- Yes.
- Thank you.

27
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,524
We should be getting another response.

28
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,173
This is a good song, Ichidai.

29
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,926
Is it?

30
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,957
With the synth…

31
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,720
Is there an '80s distortion guitar?

32
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,767
That works.

33
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,910
There. How about this?

34
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,732
- Wow, he's good.
- Incredible.

35
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,527
Totally.

36
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,366
Huh? Is it us?

37
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,201
Hey.

38
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,205
- What were you laughing at just now?
- We weren't.

39
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,457
- You were!
- We weren't! What the hell?!

40
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,875
- Are you okay?
- Get off me!

41
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,796
Is this about the new song?

42
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,009
Move it, old man.

43
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,595
That's a bit harsh. Let's go.

44
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,314
We don't need Naoki's name on that song.

45
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,486
Release it under my name only.

46
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,200
An announcement from the organizers.

47
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,371
Due to bad weather,
we must cancel today's live concert.

48
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,584
Are you kidding me?

49
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,922
Naoki. Naoki, hear me out.

50
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,508
It's part of the strategy
to spread your music--

51
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,677
It's fine. I'm not blaming you.

52
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,929
Then why are you trying to leave me?

53
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,394
What's with those eyes?

54
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,105
You look down on me, don't you?!

55
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,902
Listen. I won't ever let you leave me.

56
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,237
You can spread your wings by my side.

57
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,698
Please calm down, Mr. Isagi!

58
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,909
Get off! I said to get off me!

59
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,411
It's okay, Ichidai.

60
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,043
You can be free from me.

61
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,676
Wait.

62
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:45,983
I…

63
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,908
I said to wait!

64
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,623
What happened?

65
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,918
Oh…

66
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,962
Sorry to startle you.

67
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,383
But it'll be very soon.

68
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,593
What?

69
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,304
Very soon,

70
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,724
that nightmare will be over.

71
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,022
<i>He's stable now, but…</i>

72
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,484
we'll admit him for some tests,
just in case.

73
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,443
Okay.

74
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,408
It'll be difficult for him
to continue music like this.

75
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,786
It's his life or music.

76
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,257
I'm really…

77
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,302
sorry.

78
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,182
You understand what you did, right?

79
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,104
I was selfish.

80
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,026
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,986
It was beyond just selfish.

82
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,658
What you did was murder.

83
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,163
That's a bit too harsh, isn't it?

84
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,372
That's what it was.

85
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,293
Humoring the nonsense of a dying man,

86
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,462
letting him write a song without sleep.

87
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,679
I…

88
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:43,893
will quit.

89
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,272
I'll quit TENBLANK.

90
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,857
Akane…

91
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,400
- So--
- I will too.

92
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,154
What?

93
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,455
TENBLANK is done.

94
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,730
I'm so sorry!

95
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,357
Akane.

96
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,527
Wait a minute.

97
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,708
Akane.

98
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,129
Akane.

99
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,714
I said to wait.

100
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,217
Sorry, I don't want you to be nice to me.

101
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,844
I said to wait a minute.

102
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,639
I'm…

103
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,891
angry at myself too.

104
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,768
I'm so pissed!

105
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,911
That kindness

106
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,039
has saved me countless times.

107
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,210
Thanks to you…

108
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,632
I was able to be a part of TENBLANK.

109
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,891
Thank you for everything.

110
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,187
Hey!

111
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,951
I'm helping with a show production now.

112
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,578
Yeah.

113
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,123
That's how I found out
about TENBLANK's recent troubles.

114
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,960
I got curious and asked Genji.

115
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,591
How about a drink?

116
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,969
I'll pass. I drove here.

117
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,389
Just use a chauffeur service.

118
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,600
Or pay the crazy parking fee. Who cares?

119
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,355
That habit of mouthing a pick
instead of a cig…

120
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:42,446
all in consideration of Naoki, who's sick,
and Kazushi, who hates smoking.

121
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,449
But you were always a heavy smoker.

122
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,369
You pretend to be the understanding adult.

123
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,335
What are you trying to say?

124
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,550
I'm…

125
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:08,430
swallowing my pride and asking
to be TENBLANK's manager again.

126
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,065
I want to get back at him.

127
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,281
How childish.

128
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,413
To hold my own against
all you TENBLANK children,

129
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,999
I can't stay as an "adult."

130
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,212
Oh, but you?

131
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,548
You are much too childish.

132
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,718
Enough with the sulking.

133
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,635
What?

134
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,889
You're just upset
that Ms. Saijo took your place

135
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,142
as Naoki Fujitani's closest confidant.

136
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,280
If you run away from facing it,

137
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,199
you'll regret it like I did.

138
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,907
NAOKI FUJITANI
DONE

139
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,587
NEW A
1 ITEM

140
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,933
Your guitar playing
is really something else.

141
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:16,892
It's vicious.

142
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,269
Hey, your stride is too.

143
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,355
Come all you want, my answer won't change.

144
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,191
Sometimes your guitar playing
pisses me off.

145
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,527
There are times I want to say I hate it.

146
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,153
But in the end, I love it.

147
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,406
I can't ignore it.
I don't want to lose to it.

148
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
So the only way is
to beat you through music.

149
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,415
What?

150
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,001
While I was thinking all that,

151
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,129
I came up with a new song.

152
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,175
It's the first time I've written a song
for a specific guitarist.

153
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,146
For… me?

154
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,109
Listen to it.

155
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,031
Don't. I'm not gonna listen.

156
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,408
- Why?
- I know your talent better than anyone!

157
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,211
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

158
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,755
<i>There's a song I could hear</i>

159
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,717
<i>Since before I was born</i>

160
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,763
<i>Though it had everything</i>

161
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,600
<i>It had no shape or form</i>

162
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,651
You're the only one who's straight-up
asked me to form a band.

163
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,697
The only person in the world.

164
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,121
<i>Nameless emotions</i>

165
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,667
<i>Coalesced to make me</i>

166
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,502
<i>If that's true</i>

167
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:54,424
<i>Then there's nothing to fear</i>

168
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,095
<i>There are no wrong notes</i>

169
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,974
<i>With just that unwavering truth</i>

170
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:08,438
<i>I thought I could live in this cruel world</i>

171
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,607
<i>Tell me why you never</i>

172
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,611
<i>Say anything even though</i>

173
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,198
<i>You always ask "why?"</i>

174
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,117
Why did you…

175
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,661
Who cares about me!
Just think about this song!

176
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,329
You and this song are one and the same!

177
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,789
No, no, no!

178
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,208
I'm telling you, you don't need me!

179
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,752
I'm leaving TENBLANK.

180
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,965
That would mean TENBLANK falls apart.

181
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,801
So we're disbanding?

182
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:43,932
<i>…break through the stillness</i>

183
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:05,746
<i>Today too</i>
<i>The city breathes out fresh sounds</i>

184
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,789
<i>Merging as one</i>

185
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,919
<i>Among the countless melodies</i>

186
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>I heard your voice cut through</i>

187
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,686
Huh?

188
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,688
Why are you here?!

189
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,315
I saw your car.

190
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,984
Just get in! Quickly!

191
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,364
I thought you were at the hospital?

192
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,409
You're all soaked. Here.

193
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,706
Oh, hey.

194
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,253
Come on, wipe yourself properly.

195
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,005
Let me warm it up.

196
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,092
You listened to it.

197
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,144
You know…

198
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,356
I thought about it.

199
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,655
I'm the one who makes you happy.

200
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,866
Huh?

201
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,410
That's why…

202
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,500
Play guitar by my side
for the rest of my life.

203
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,676
What is this? A proposal?

204
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:51,643
<i>What is this feeling inside me?</i>

205
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:56,773
<i>I might use it all up</i>

206
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:01,236
<i>Before I even understand it</i>

207
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,972
It stopped raining.

208
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,516
Yeah.

209
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,605
Since we're here,
how about I sing on the street there?

210
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,981
Listen to the full chorus.

211
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:38,940
Come again?

212
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,151
You'll be so moved, you'll cry again.

213
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,695
I've cried enough tears
for a lifetime over you.

214
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,032
No way, you'll cry for sure.
I won't stop singing until you do.

215
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,658
Who are you, Jonathan Joestar?

216
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,411
- You know your stuff.
- I do.

217
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,545
You're really gonna sing until I cry?

218
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,548
That's right.

219
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,680
Then…

220
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,642
I won't cry for the rest of my life.

221
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,998
"New B"?

222
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:23,920
Oh, yeah.

223
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,841
That one's off-limits.

224
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,677
I don't intend to let anyone hear it.

225
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,305
No one?

226
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,685
There's someone
you want to hear it, right?

227
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,947
<i>Yes?</i>

228
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,450
- Hi, I'm from Vermilion.
<i>- Okay.</i>

229
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,118
I came to deliver your curry.

230
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,708
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

231
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,044
Merry Christmas.

232
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,420
Say "thank you."

233
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,047
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

234
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,548
Thank you.

235
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,426
- Did you say "Merry Christmas"?
- Yeah.

236
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,802
Good job!

237
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,187
I'm back from delivery!

238
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,271
Oh, thanks.

239
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,648
- I'm back!
- Welcome back.

240
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,274
Welcome back, Akane.

241
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,861
Another order for the Christmas version?

242
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,447
You clock out. I'll finish up the rest.

243
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,116
That's my line. You guys go out.

244
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,826
It's fine. We can do that any time.

245
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,036
- Right?
- Right?

246
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,496
We always see each other.

247
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,373
But it's Christmas.

248
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,293
Yeah, so don't you have
somewhere to go, Akane?

249
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,128
Hmm? What are you saying?

250
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,130
Here you go.

251
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,803
Take this to Naoki's house.

252
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,471
Not you too, Momoko?

253
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,934
I already quit TENBLANK.

254
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,354
Hey, Akane.

255
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:11,653
Is abandoning music,
TENBLANK, and all of it

256
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,114
really okay with you?

257
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,263
You're not coming back?

258
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:40,807
I can't.

259
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,976
If I come back,

260
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,187
I might end up
running Sensei ragged again.

261
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,153
Taking music away from him

262
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,823
was basically the same as killing him,
wasn't it?

263
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,203
Trying to take away
something he cherished

264
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,625
just because we wanted him
to live a little longer?

265
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,336
It was all just our own egos.

266
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,173
You knew that from the start,
didn't you, Akane?

267
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,508
Right?

268
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,428
That's why you took him out.

269
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,306
- But…
- Here.

270
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,141
Catch!

271
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,100
What?

272
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,563
Naoki wrote it.

273
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,399
A new song.

274
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,652
- Hold on, I can't--
- I love you, Akane.

275
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,950
But I was wrong.

276
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,827
That.

277
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,245
What?

278
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,123
We're close in age.

279
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,876
And we grew close.

280
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,798
And I never really had experience
with romance.

281
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,841
That's why…

282
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,303
I misunderstood.

283
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,350
I don't like your sound.

284
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,810
What?

285
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:11,231
I really can't deal
with that dumb positivity of yours.

286
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,482
What was that song now?

287
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,110
Because it felt like one of yours!

288
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,236
I really liked it!

289
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,655
It's delicate yet powerful.

290
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,491
Let me hear it one more time! Please!

291
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,784
- Pretty please!
- No.

292
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,168
Just for five seconds.

293
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,882
Kazushi…

294
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,344
So let me correct myself.

295
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,017
I…

296
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,856
love your drumming, Akane.

297
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,670
You're scared, aren't you?

298
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,676
This sound wasn't something
that was always inside you.

299
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,598
It was born because
you were thinking of Akane.

300
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,143
That's why you're afraid to let it out.

301
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,273
It's a sound that can hurt people.

302
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,026
I don't care if I get hurt.

303
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,028
If it's by you.

304
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,364
You always charge ahead
without hesitation,

305
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,575
but you're slamming on the brakes now?

306
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,806
I…

307
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,937
I'll take you with me, with my music.

308
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,901
So please…

309
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,205
don't just disappear on your own.

310
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,702
NAOKI

311
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,810
NAOKI

312
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,734
<i>Huh? No way. Why did you pick up?</i>

313
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,529
Am I not allowed to answer?

314
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,114
<i>You're not.</i>

315
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,619
<i>But that's fine.</i>

316
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,162
<i>Hey…</i>

317
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,081
<i>I called you today</i>
<i>because I have a favor to ask.</i>

318
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,668
No.

319
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,295
<i>I know.</i>

320
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,883
<i>I figured I'd be turned down,</i>
<i>so I've got a secret weapon.</i>

321
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,677
Secret weapon?

322
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,478
<i>Oh, it's snowing.</i>

323
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,481
Huh?

324
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,232
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

325
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,443
I can see Tokyo Tower.

326
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,195
Tokyo Tower?

327
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,613
<i>Yeah.</i>

328
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,740
<i>And…</i>

329
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,367
I can see a big tree.

330
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,452
It's beautiful.

331
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,958
Are you outside now?

332
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,585
When it's so cold?
Please go inside somewhere!

333
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,340
Isn't snow great?

334
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,468
The way it traps sound.

335
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,477
More importantly, about the secret weapon.

336
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,522
Before,

337
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,817
<i>when I wrote a song to win over Sho,</i>

338
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,902
it turned out amazing.

339
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,698
Like Brahms dedicating his work
to Clara Schumann. Amazing.

340
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,451
<i>That's how I won him over.</i>

341
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,249
<i>That's not why I say this, but…</i>

342
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,129
<i>remember when we were at the cabin?</i>

343
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,554
<i>While I was watching you sleep,</i>

344
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,015
<i>the music started naturally pouring.</i>

345
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,600
<i>I wrote another song then.</i>

346
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,271
<i>I'd never written a song like this.</i>

347
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,691
I need to work up my courage,
but can I sing it?

348
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,651
I said no, didn't I?

349
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,946
- Move it!
- I'm sorry!

350
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,073
<i>Here I go.</i>

351
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:59,871
<i>I thought I heard a familiar song</i>

352
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:06,586
<i>But it was just the sound of your laugh</i>

353
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:12,633
<i>I tried to brush it off as merely chance</i>

354
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,511
<i>But then your sound</i>
<i>Filled the spaces within me…</i>

355
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,429
<i>Sensei.</i>

356
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,893
<i>I made a mistake again.</i>

357
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:30,026
<i>As eternity looked upon us</i>
<i>With pitying eyes</i>

358
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:35,490
<i>You smiled in such a mysterious way</i>

359
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:42,830
<i>You calmly rearrange the order</i>

360
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:48,753
<i>Of things that are important to me</i>

361
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:53,674
<i>There's a song in this world</i>
<i>That only we can hear</i>

362
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,343
GOD, THANK YOU FOR LEADING ME TO TENBLANK

363
00:34:55,426 --> 00:35:01,682
<i>I'll do anything to share this life</i>

364
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,103
<i>And keep that melody going</i>

365
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,814
<i>I get worried when I can't hear…</i>

366
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,856
<i>Beyond this moment.</i>

367
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,859
<i>Beyond eternity.</i>

368
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,530
<i>It transcends them all.</i>

369
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,074
<i>This sound…</i>

370
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,078
<i>reaches me.</i>

371
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,582
<i>This sound</i>

372
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,293
<i>is calling out to say</i>

373
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,880
<i>that it loves me.</i>

374
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:41,347
<i>As eternity looked upon us</i>
<i>With pitying eyes</i>

375
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,894
<i>You smiled in such a mysterious way</i>

376
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:54,402
<i>You calmly rearrange the order</i>

377
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:59,949
<i>Of things that are important to me</i>

378
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,834
Akane…

379
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,130
Are you Santa Claus?

380
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,475
I'm sorry I lied.

381
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,816
I…

382
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,236
I told you I couldn't fall in love.

383
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,745
But I want every version of you
to be mine.

384
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,249
The everyday Akane,

385
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,461
the Akane pounding the drums…

386
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,839
No boundaries.

387
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:58,966
All of you.

388
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,191
Me too.

389
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,446
When I think of you,

390
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,157
it all blurs together.

391
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,245
All these different feelings
jumble together.

392
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,540
Whether it's love, admiration,

393
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,919
or even fear.

394
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,259
The lines disappear.

395
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,285
So there are no lines
between you and me.

396
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,707
The line between you and me?

397
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,798
The song earlier…

398
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,634
Keep listening.

399
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:34,603
<i>Instead of embracing</i>

400
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:42,320
<i>We quietly cried our hearts out</i>

401
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:51,120
<i>No one taught me how to live</i>

402
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,501
<i>Even if I'm mocked</i>

403
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,548
<i>For being clumsy</i>

404
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:12,099
<i>This is the life I chose</i>

405
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,791
<i>I want…</i>

406
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,086
<i>to keep feeling this.</i>

407
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,507
<i>Sensei's life.</i>

408
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:50,888
<i>I get worried when I can't hear</i>

409
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:57,228
<i>The clamor of your life</i>

410
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:03,859
<i>I realized I'll never go back</i>
<i>To the way I was</i>

411
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,071
<i>Before I knew you…</i>

412
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,448
Kazushi, do you have a sec?

413
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,206
Do I look like I do?

414
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,047
It's so good, it pisses me off.

415
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,759
It's a total defeat.

416
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,854
What are you doing?

417
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,065
At times like these…

418
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,945
even if it's by force,

419
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,657
it's best to turn it into music.

420
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,785
In our case.

421
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,354
Enough.

422
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:52,968
Hey.

423
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,348
Here.

424
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,101
I wrote out the song.

425
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:11,946
<i>The moment I touched it</i>
<i>It slipped away</i>

426
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,241
<i>Even if that's what</i>

427
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,452
<i>It means to live</i>

428
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:25,167
<i>I don't want to go along with that anymore</i>

429
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,139
<i>As eternity looked…</i>

430
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,140
Welcome back.

431
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,479
I'm back.

432
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>…as it came closer</i>

433
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,904
<i>There's something only I can do</i>

434
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:58,117
<i>That eternity can't</i>

435
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,329
<i>There is a sound I want to let ring</i>

436
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:07,585
<i>There's someone I want to hear it now</i>

437
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:14,425
<i>There's a heartbeat</i>
<i>I want to make tremble</i>

438
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,426
<i>We're back.</i>

439
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,442
At last.

440
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,324
Mr. Isagi, there's a problem. Yukino is…

441
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,911
<i>Hey, you all might not believe it.</i>

442
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,331
<i>Hey, it's true.</i>

443
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,625
<i>All of my hit songs up to now</i>

444
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,962
<i>were written by Naoki Fujitani,</i>
<i>not Ichidai Isagi!</i>

445
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,883
<i>Terrifying!</i>

446
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,886
<i>Crazy, right?</i>
<i>The dark side of the industry.</i>

447
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,681
<i>I mean, Ichidai Isagi has no talent.</i>

448
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,599
Hey.

449
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,269
He's just good at business and lying.

450
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,646
That's it.

451
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,231
Me too…

452
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:16,028
I tried to make it work,
but it was impossible.

453
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,993
<i>Because I met people</i>
<i>who were serious about music.</i>

454
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,125
<i>That's why I also…</i>

455
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,381
<i>don't want to lie to the music I love.</i>

456
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,634
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

457
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,053
What's this ditz saying? Make her stop.

458
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,096
Yes, sir.

459
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,523
<i>Oh, a call from my agency!</i>

460
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,442
<i>Ignore. I'm ignoring it!</i>

461
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,737
<i>Huh?</i>

462
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,740
<i>"Are you allowed to say this stuff?"</i>

463
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,910
<i>"Won't you be erased from the industry?"</i>

464
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,331
<i>Maybe.</i>

465
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,375
<i>But, you know,</i>

466
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,795
<i>I won't be dying alone.</i>

467
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,216
<i>I'm taking Isagi down with me</i>
<i>through this livestream.</i>

468
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,139
<i>Yes, and with that,</i>

469
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,100
<i>the final boss has been defeated!</i>

470
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,810
- Shut up!
<i>- Bye!</i>

471
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:33,188
<i>- Thanks for watching--</i>
- Shut up!

472
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,107
Shut up!

473
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,862
LIVESTREAM HAS ENDED

474
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,656
I feel better.

475
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,551
<i>That's too sudden.</i>

476
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,595
Canceling your performance?

477
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:05,929
Please wait.

478
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,891
I see. Let me confirm.

479
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,894
Mr. Isagi, the reporters…

480
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,187
Send them away.

481
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,564
You still can't find Yukino?

482
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,400
No, we haven't been able to reach her.
Natsume too.

483
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,318
Shit.

484
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,069
Hurry up!

485
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,160
Hurry up!

486
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,705
Come on!

487
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,999
Wait!

488
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,001
It says Z-OUT's a no-show.

489
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:36,960
What the hell?!

490
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,005
"As people who purely love music,

491
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:45,052
we cannot participate in a festival
organized by someone who desecrates it."

492
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,473
"We sincerely apologize to all our fans."

493
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,557
Hey!

494
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,435
How long are you gonna make us wait?

495
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,896
It's Isagi's fault!

496
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,856
You can't blame them!

497
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,486
Let's go home!

498
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,487
This sucks!

499
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,368
The people are leaving.

500
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,166
<i>Mr. Isagi!</i>

501
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,715
Huh?

502
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,487
TENBLANK?

503
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,369
Just as I'd expect from you, Kai.

504
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,878
Attracting this many people
on the day of the festival.

505
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,131
That's just how much pull TENBLANK has.

506
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,467
The second I made the announcement,
the inquiries came pouring.

507
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,054
Kai.

508
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,225
You asked me if you could return
as manager, right?

509
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,019
You still feel the same?

510
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,022
No.

511
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,358
Unfortunately, I don't.

512
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:24,943
What?

513
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,321
I'm not just returning.

514
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,200
I'm going to take them back from you.

515
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:38,957
Then I'm not giving them up either,
so prepare yourself.

516
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,673
It's about to start.

517
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,469
The legend of TENBLANK.
