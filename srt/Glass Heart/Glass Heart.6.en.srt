1
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>Can you hear me, Mr. Shinzaki?</i>

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,261
Mr. Shinzaki?

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,930
- Ambu bag.
- Get the defib. Prepare to intubate.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,098
- Yes, sir.
- Clear.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,141
Clear.

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,732
- Sho, your family runs a soba restaurant?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,817
I'd grind buckwheat
on a millstone at 5:00 a.m.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,152
Really?

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,486
I'd love to see that.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,612
Pure grace.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,240
- Bragging again?
- Wanna try grinding it at my place?

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,159
They say Toya Shinzaki isn't here yet.

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,787
They want us to go ahead first.

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,705
Huh?

15
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,794
Let's get ready.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,379
Seriously?

17
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,630
How soon?

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,007
In about 15 minutes.

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,050
Can you make it?

20
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,789
TENBLANK, you're up. Thank you.

21
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,082
Good luck.

22
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,792
Thank you.

23
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,181
Hear from the manager?

24
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,517
We just got word
that Toya's at the hospital.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,018
Hospital? Hey.

26
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,686
What's going on?

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,772
It seems Toya was taken to the hospital.

28
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,982
- Why?
- I don't know the details.

29
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,863
- Toya?
- Is this the news?

30
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,448
- No way.
- What?

31
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,367
- No way. This is bad!
- I can't take this!

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,409
What's going on?

33
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,494
This is really bad.

34
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,037
- Why, why, why?
- No…

35
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,789
BREAKING NEWS: SERIAL STABBING?

36
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,249
OVER CHROME…

37
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,416
Yeah, it's him.

38
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,464
Sensei.

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,718
Toya was stabbed
and taken to the hospital.

40
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,188
Gen, what's wrong?

41
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,776
Well, Toya was apparently stabbed
by someone.

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,902
- What?
- Huh?

43
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,154
Toya was stabbed?

44
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,405
Huh? Is he conscious?

45
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,867
All I know is that he was taken
to the hospital.

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,753
Toya!

47
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,923
Let me see Toya!

48
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,717
Where's Toya?

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,844
Hey, Toya? Toya?

50
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,110
We'll hold things down here.

51
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,907
Thank you.

52
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,791
Everyone, I'm sorry.

53
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,628
I'm going to bring Toya back.

54
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,892
I'm sure you're all anxious right now.

55
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,644
I know you're in pain.

56
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,814
The power of music
may just be a speck of hope.

57
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,484
But still…

58
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,408
we want to be your support right now.

59
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,466
<i>How many times</i>
<i>do I have to tell you, Toya?</i>

60
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,426
Again.

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,640
Wrong!

62
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,610
Wrong.

63
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,237
Again.

64
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,658
Enough already!

65
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,911
Listen.

66
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,956
Unlike that child, you're my son, Toya.

67
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,624
So why can't you do it?

68
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,336
Naoki can do it. So why?

69
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,583
Hey.

70
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,752
Let's go.

71
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,927
Don't tell me you're going on stage.

72
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,221
You can't.

73
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,140
If you try to sing now, you'll die.

74
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,772
I'll sing even if it kills me.

75
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,861
I know.

76
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,156
No matter what happens.

77
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,034
No matter when.

78
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,996
Even on the verge of death.

79
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,792
You're someone who wants to sing.

80
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,838
But…

81
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,593
it's not your time to die yet.

82
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,395
Huh?

83
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,771
You're still… alive?

84
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,777
Sorry about that.

85
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,738
I missed my chance to become a legend.

86
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,852
Are your fingers okay?

87
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,769
What?

88
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,814
You make no sense as usual.

89
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,734
It's my stomach that got stabbed.

90
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,695
When you hurt your fingers
on the piano lid…

91
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,745
I never got to ask if you were okay.

92
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,840
You know,

93
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,764
I've always wanted to be someone who
could struggle for music the way you do.

94
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,061
Music is everything to me.

95
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,856
But I don't have the same obsession.

96
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,111
I've always admired your dedication.

97
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,712
Where are you going?

98
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,838
The only reason I've been able
to keep making music is because of you.

99
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,510
So…

100
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,181
Promise me you'll outlive me,
even by just a second.

101
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,683
Please.

102
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,689
You don't hold a grudge against me?

103
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,400
Why would I?

104
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,654
If anything, I'm grateful to you
and to your mother.

105
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,908
Our father had me with someone else,
but you still let me stay.

106
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,083
Damn it, why didn't you say that sooner?

107
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,753
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,444
Get me up.

109
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,987
Huh?

110
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,074
The show's already started, right?

111
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,785
Yeah, but let's do it some other time.

112
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,999
There are people out there
who'd die if I don't sing.

113
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,628
Those people would hate it even more
if you died, Toya.

114
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,174
I made a promise.

115
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,636
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Dummies all around me</i>

116
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,930
<i>Be crazy, crazy!</i>
<i>It's our brand-new era</i>

117
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,057
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Expose the dark around me</i>

118
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,851
<i>I don't need no love or dreams, okay?</i>

119
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>Now shake off any doubt</i>
<i>Just be yourself</i>

120
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,152
<i>Ain't no good or evil here</i>

121
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,913
Toya…

122
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,687
What do you want?

123
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,945
Run!

124
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,406
Run for it!

125
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,532
No!

126
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,782
Sorry, I got your clothes dirty.

127
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,994
Get changed quick and come to the show.

128
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,288
What? Why?

129
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,957
You're always there, aren't you?

130
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,463
It's okay.

131
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,965
I'll sing.

132
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,176
Got it?

133
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,597
So make sure you come to the show.

134
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:34,980
Promise me.

135
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,322
Come on, it's starting. Go now.

136
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,102
<i>Hey, turbulence</i>
<i>Get me, get me higher!</i>

137
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,646
<i>I'm looking through the shadows for a sign</i>

138
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,023
<i>The memories I ripped from my mind</i>

139
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,526
<i>You who felt the same pain, been maligned</i>

140
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>Stand together now and bring the fight</i>

141
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,905
<i>Kick up a fuss and switch it up</i>

142
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,074
<i>Disastrous, it's a furious turbulence</i>

143
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,577
<i>Play a deep-deep-deep and killer tune</i>

144
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,997
<i>Ignite a mental fire like a fool</i>

145
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,583
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Dummies all around me</i>

146
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,626
<i>Be crazy, crazy!</i>
<i>It's our brand-new era</i>

147
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,254
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
<i>Expose the dark around me</i>

148
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,883
<i>I'll devour your scream</i>

149
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,551
Toya?

150
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,303
- Kazushi.
- Toya!

151
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,430
- Is he back?
- What happened to Toya?

152
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,644
- Can you handle the bass?
- Me?

153
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,315
I'm counting on you.

154
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,987
<i>Yo.</i>

155
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,950
<i>Sorry for being late.</i>

156
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,459
Thank you, Genji.

157
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,377
You really saved me.

158
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,879
That was intense.

159
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,422
Glad I made it in time.

160
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,011
My stomach's feeling off today.

161
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,429
Can't make it over there.

162
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,812
<i>I'm not singing for any of you.</i>

163
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:43,067
<i>I sing because I want to so bad.</i>
<i>I'll die if I don't.</i>

164
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,361
But…

165
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,157
There are people out there
living off my songs.

166
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,660
I don't know why.

167
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,206
Because my songs are selfish, messed-up.

168
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:03,045
<i>And yet, you still listen.</i>

169
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,802
<i>And I love you for that.</i>

170
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,561
<i>Thanks for giving me a place to sing.</i>

171
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,230
Toya!

172
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,856
Toya!

173
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,736
Toya!

174
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,863
Toya!

175
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,533
<i>And…</i>

176
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,039
<i>that guy over there, Naoki Fujitani?</i>

177
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,677
I've hated him since we were kids.

178
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,724
Seriously hated him. He pissed me off
so much, I couldn't stand it.

179
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,519
Because he had everything I ever wanted.

180
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,398
Damn bastard. Still pisses me off.

181
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,485
But the truth is,

182
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,321
I admired Naoki Fujitani.

183
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,079
I wanted to be Naoki Fujitani.

184
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,084
I didn't want to chase his back,

185
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,212
but stand beside him.

186
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,304
Not that I'll ever say this again.

187
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,645
Anyway, shall we sing, Big Bro?

188
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:32,027
<i>I don't believe in hatred with love</i>

189
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:37,616
<i>I don't believe we're good by nature</i>

190
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:42,663
<i>I only loved myself</i>

191
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:47,584
<i>The garden of Tokyo grows misty, misty</i>

192
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,130
<i>On a starless night</i>

193
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,966
<i>The reluctant waning moon drifts above</i>

194
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,762
<i>Blotting out the crescent</i>

195
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,933
<i>A shaking, shaking</i>

196
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,061
<i>Quivering voice</i>

197
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:12,568
<i>Sang out in full vibrato</i>

198
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:22,911
<i>The frustrations and struggles of my past</i>

199
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:30,169
<i>Surely made me who I am</i>

200
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,802
<i>I vowed to this formless love</i>

201
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:53,066
<i>I don't accept sorrow without love</i>

202
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,403
<i>What sort of day</i>

203
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:02,701
<i>Lies beyond the end?</i>

204
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,163
<i>A wavering, wavering</i>

205
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,875
<i>Distorted voice</i>

206
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:17,257
<i>Shouted out in full vibrato</i>

207
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:26,391
<i>I chose the untraveled path</i>

208
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:33,899
<i>With cruel yet transparent</i>
<i>Freedom and dreams</i>

209
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:42,491
<i>It made this formless me</i>

210
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,006
So make sure you come to the show.

211
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,386
Promise me.

212
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,515
Toya!

213
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,860
<i>A shaking, shaking</i>

214
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,197
<i>Quivering voice</i>

215
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:28,954
<i>Sang out in full vibrato</i>

216
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:38,588
<i>The frustrations and struggles of my past</i>

217
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:46,430
<i>Wish for this limitless future</i>

218
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:53,979
<i>I sing this song without an end</i>

219
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:58,150
<i>I'm so glad I met you</i>

220
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,945
<i>I won't forget that day</i>

221
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,616
<i>We'll surely get through</i>

222
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,495
<i>So light, do not fade</i>

223
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:15,083
<i>Even if my body weakens</i>

224
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,379
<i>My heart will not</i>

225
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:26,011
<i>It's the song of our love</i>

226
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,905
Toya!

227
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,297
After the cameras go down,
please take the rails too.

228
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,465
Okay, got it.

229
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,801
I've already got the car waiting out back.

230
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,677
Ms. Tajika!

231
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,889
Hey, in the end,
that song totally became yours.

232
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,890
Oh, yeah?

233
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,643
This is exactly why I hate you.

234
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,353
- Well, I like you.
- Dumbass.

235
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,525
Hey.

236
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,406
You'd better stay alive
until a second before I die.

237
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,409
Big Bro.

238
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,373
I probably won't be dying yet.

239
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,544
Either way, let's keep doing
music forever.

240
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,088
It'll be fun.

241
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,512
Oh, I'm sorry! Excuse me.

242
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,269
Akane Saijo!

243
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,062
Yes.

244
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,735
Akane Saijo!

245
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:07,988
Yes!

246
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,449
Is it fun?

247
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,451
Music?

248
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,082
I love it!

249
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,217
See ya.

250
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,994
They all looked happy, didn't they?

251
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,122
What is happiness?

252
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,001
I wonder.

253
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,712
What's yours?

254
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,592
I don't really understand
the conventional version of happiness.

255
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,386
Then what's your version…

256
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,097
Mahiro?

257
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,776
Hey.

258
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,736
Do you hate my songs?

259
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,498
I don't hate them.

260
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,628
I just don't like them.

261
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,923
Then what do you like about me?

262
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,176
If you don't like my songs,

263
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,095
tell me what you want.

264
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,638
I'll give you just one thing.

265
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,600
What?

266
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,230
I don't like you, nor do I give a damn.

267
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,400
But…

268
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,991
From now on,
your hands and feet are my tools.

269
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,910
In return,
I'll let you take one thing with you.

270
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,498
To where?

271
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,384
To the top.

272
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,765
What's yours, Mahiro?

273
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:42,976
Your happiness?

274
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,024
That you exist.

275
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,570
Because

276
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:59,242
I want you to show me a glimpse
of a breathtaking view.

277
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,746
In fact,

278
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,292
I'm still not satisfied with you
as you are now.

279
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:14,049
Because… I still don't know

280
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,509
whether this is the top or not.

281
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,140
If a place like this is the top,
then I'm not satisfied either.

282
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,103
Man, I'm starving.

283
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,730
Let's go get ramen.

284
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,691
That's not happening.

285
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:15,902
<i>Nice.</i>

286
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,488
Yeah, looking cute.

287
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,824
Great, give me a bigger smile.

288
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,909
Even bigger.

289
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,411
She pulls off every expression.

290
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,996
Yes, that's good! Adorable.

291
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,206
That's it, keep it up.

292
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,459
Now, give me an upward glance.

293
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,172
Okay, great. Cute!
Now an even brighter smile.

294
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,549
Yeah, lovely.

295
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,801
Okay, last shot.

296
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,053
One more for good measure.

297
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,596
Good.

298
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,433
Perfect! Okay.

299
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,600
I'll check the monitor.

300
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,562
Ms. Yukino will do the interview
during touch-ups.

301
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,960
Damn it. Every last one of them.

302
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,549
All right, then.

303
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,926
Cheers!

304
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,720
Nice work.

305
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,598
I haven't seen Sho drink
in half a century.

306
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,226
- Wait, how old is he supposed to be?
- That's a memory from my past life.

307
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,729
But, you know, it's kinda nice.

308
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,190
Working up a sweat on stage,

309
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,734
having people listen to our music,

310
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,488
spending time like this with the crew…

311
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,656
It's the best feeling ever.

312
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,869
Sho's a pretty sentimental type, huh?

313
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,917
I didn't say anything.

314
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,502
Wasn't me. It was Akane.

315
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,795
- Not me!
- No.

316
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,880
Come on, let's lean into it more!

317
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,798
- What?
- Huh?

318
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,216
That's creepy. What is it?

319
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,470
Why are you smiling like that?

320
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,096
Whoa, that scared me!

321
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,599
- Take that!
- Ugh, that's crazy!

322
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,354
Over here!

323
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,982
The Four-Player Throwing Game!

324
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,569
We'll take turns throwing one by one.

325
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,197
If you hit that bottle and knock it over,
you're good.

326
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:11,077
If you miss or fail to knock it down,
you get a penalty.

327
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,745
What kind of penalty?

328
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,205
Let's see…

329
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,666
How about you spill a secret?

330
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,667
Secret?

331
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,628
If we were in high school,
it'd be like confessing who you like.

332
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,546
- Huh?
- What?!

333
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,345
It's been a while.

334
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,725
Oh, Doctor.

335
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,232
You're not still doing music, are you?

336
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,157
All right, I'll go first,
then Kazushi, then Naoki,

337
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,825
and Akane can nail the final shot.

338
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,226
Okay, here goes Saijo.

339
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,937
- Time out.
- What?

340
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,105
- Time out.
- Huh?

341
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,148
Time out, time out.

342
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,154
Definitely a sucker for the sentimental.

343
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,665
If we all win together like this,

344
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,458
where's the fun in that?

345
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,336
So let's bet for the final shot

346
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,130
on whether Akane can hit the bottle
from this distance.

347
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,759
I… have a feeling I'll hit it.

348
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,177
- Miss.
- She'll miss.

349
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,554
My positive comment had no impact?

350
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,682
Then I'll bet on it falling.

351
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,183
I know you can do it, Akane.

352
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,853
I'll do my best for you, Sensei.

353
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,815
Here I go!

354
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,275
Go!

355
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,422
Oh, no!

356
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,340
- Yes!
- Yeah!

357
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,759
No way.

358
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,053
Too bad.

359
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,139
No worries, Akane.

360
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,141
So, as promised…

361
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,103
Naoki, your secret first.

362
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,772
Yeah.

363
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,400
You're not in a state to perform music.

364
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,119
What if I still choose to do music anyway?

365
