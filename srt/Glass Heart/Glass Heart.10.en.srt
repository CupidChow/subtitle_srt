1
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,118
What? Here to save me?

2
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,788
I've always…

3
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,669
selfishly longed for figures
like a father or brother.

4
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,050
I assumed it was only natural
for you to guide me.

5
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,887
And I ended up hurting your music.

6
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,856
That's why I feel I have to say this.

7
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,338
No matter what.

8
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,673
Let's make sure we come back.

9
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,343
All four of us.

10
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,846
Yeah.

11
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,809
Let's come back.

12
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,984
On three.

13
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,195
Let's go!

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:12,048
"CRYSTALLINE ECHO"

15
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,940
<i>Am I still dreaming?</i>

16
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,943
<i>I'm sure I felt it</i>

17
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,946
<i>Is there even any point</i>

18
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:39,576
<i>In separating dreams from reality?</i>

19
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>In a distant melody</i>

20
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,876
<i>Far beyond our comprehension</i>

21
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,336
<i>The raindrops celebrate this life</i>

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,757
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

23
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,260
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

24
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,680
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

25
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

26
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,227
<i>The way you held your umbrella</i>

27
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,814
<i>Taught me everything about kindness</i>

28
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,901
<i>I hung my head and cried</i>

29
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,362
<i>Afraid you'd see through my imitation</i>

30
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,787
<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>We were broken apart</i>

31
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,415
<i>A song was found in our love</i>

32
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>The magic that brings back to life…</i>

33
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,088
Sing it!

34
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,467
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

35
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

36
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,806
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

37
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,517
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

38
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,354
<i>The way your shoulders shook</i>

39
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,565
<i>Taught me everything about regret</i>

40
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,777
<i>I lost sight of what was right</i>

41
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,572
<i>And in a daze, pulled you close</i>

42
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,896
"UNBROKEN"

43
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:44,242
<i>I named the flowers</i>
<i>Blooming along the winding road</i>

44
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:51,207
<i>And keep them in a silent forest</i>
<i>As bookmarks for memories</i>

45
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,627
<i>I can't say if the future</i>

46
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,046
<i>Will be vibrant and lively</i>

47
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,090
<i>But that's just fine</i>

48
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,051
<i>I don't fit in, and I can't love</i>

49
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,638
<i>But these notes wholly embraced me</i>

50
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,851
<i>I'd like to live in a world…</i>

51
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,103
Akane looks so full of life.

52
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:17,650
When you get down to it,
music isn't about being good at it or not.

53
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,485
<i>Huh?</i>

54
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:25,700
<i>Music is about discovering</i>
<i>what's happening inside you.</i>

55
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,954
<i>You have to face yourself thoroughly,</i>

56
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,040
<i>expose your whole self,</i>

57
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,085
<i>and only then</i>
<i>can you move someone's heart.</i>

58
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,755
<i>I see.</i>

59
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,008
So Akane is playing for herself.

60
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,474
Enjoy it to the fullest, Akane.

61
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:56,439
<i>I won't let it end yet</i>

62
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,280
TENBLANK!

63
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,718
#SOUL-STIRRING #TENBLANK

64
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,263
THEIR ENERGY IS HITTING ME FULL FORCE

65
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,142
ALL I WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS TENBLANK
THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE THEM

66
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,313
<i>Intersecting lines of scattered emotions</i>

67
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,691
<i>Sketch an uneven chart of connections</i>

68
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,945
<i>Leaping onto the page of a random melody</i>

69
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,531
<i>A vague sound lingers</i>

70
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,201
<i>Can't you see?</i>

71
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,912
<i>How that old bewilderment</i>

72
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:57,708
<i>And her quivering voice overlap</i>

73
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:08,511
<i>I might not even have much to say</i>

74
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:15,226
<i>I might not even have a rare talent</i>

75
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,812
<i>But I want to shout it out</i>

76
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,813
<i>This unnamed sound…</i>

77
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,857
YUKINO, WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU ON STAGE

78
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,150
<i>…deep in my throat</i>

79
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,527
<i>I just need to shout it out, shout it out</i>

80
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,446
<i>Until I'm hollow</i>

81
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,322
<i>Just sing out loud</i>

82
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,619
I didn't know they were so dazzling.

83
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,832
Everything I lost is right there.

84
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,794
But I don't regret it.

85
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,629
Huh?

86
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,924
I was able to protect this sight.

87
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,392
Pretending to be the righteous heroine?

88
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,563
Tell me, Yukino.

89
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,317
I can give you the best music.

90
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,361
So why would you throw it away so easily?

91
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,283
At this rate, my songs will die.

92
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,494
What?

93
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,456
If my songs die,

94
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,791
I'll probably end up just like you.

95
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,797
And that would be hell.

96
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,092
Either way, your songs will be dead!

97
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,970
There's no place left for you to sing!

98
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,430
Me,

99
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,933
you, we're both finished!

100
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,745
Wait, she's singing?

101
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,955
Yukino!

102
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,758
Ms. Yukino.

103
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,804
Akane asked me

104
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,932
to bring you to the stage.

105
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,727
Akane…

106
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,609
You bastards, how could you?

107
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,867
As we go through life,

108
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,744
a lot happens, right?

109
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,792
You trust someone, only to be betrayed.

110
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,670
You give it everything you've got,

111
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,797
only to be trampled on.

112
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,760
There are countless people out there
who do those things without shame.

113
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,929
And yet,

114
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,056
there is someone

115
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,601
who believes in the power of music

116
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,104
and continues to fight.

117
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,815
She is

118
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,027
more honest and true to music than anyone.

119
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,405
Watching her,

120
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,532
I…

121
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,535
We found strength to keep fighting!

122
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,748
Thank you!

123
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:28,961
Yukino!

124
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,635
Yukino!

125
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,636
Don't worry.

126
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,554
You're not done yet.

127
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,513
Let's do this!

128
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,490
"A SONG FOR US TO SING"

129
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,409
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

130
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,870
<i>Closer by your side</i>

131
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,331
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

132
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>Feeling the heat from your body</i>

133
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,127
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

134
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,505
<i>No rush, taking our time</i>

135
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,965
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

136
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,720
<i>Our blushing faces</i>

137
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,972
<i>Reflected in cups full of tea</i>

138
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,600
<i>Who are you looking at</i>

139
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,687
<i>Pretending you don't know?</i>

140
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,689
<i>Our gazes cross</i>

141
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,108
<i>Full of warmth</i>

142
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,527
<i>Every time I trace</i>

143
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,530
<i>The day we first met</i>

144
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,909
<i>A refreshing squall falls smooth</i>
<i>Passing through</i>

145
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:46,080
<i>Dried-out macaroni tells the time</i>

146
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>A refreshing squall</i>

147
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,544
<i>Leads us toward our goal</i>

148
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,130
<i>A teasing scent</i>

149
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,298
<i>Brushes over pale skin…</i>

150
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,300
I thought Naoki cut you off.

151
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,221
I thought you were just like me.

152
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,184
An ordinary person made miserable
by a genius's sound.

153
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,148
But that wasn't it.

154
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,735
You denied your own talent

155
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,404
and just gave up.

156
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,494
If we had the strength
to believe in ourselves like she does,

157
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,582
maybe we could've seen a different world.

158
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,216
Yukino!

159
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,553
Yukino!

160
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,054
Yukino!

161
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,390
- Yukino!
- Yukino!

162
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,193
Thank you!

163
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,652
Thank you.

164
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,030
Yukino!

165
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,837
- Huh?
- What's going on?

166
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,256
Naoki?

167
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,384
Huh? No way!

168
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,636
That's a lie, right?

169
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,429
- Naoki!
- Sensei…

170
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,098
Naoki!

171
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,141
What does this mean?

172
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,643
Naoki's sick?!

173
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,602
No way! Come on.

174
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,020
He's been sick all along?

175
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,105
It says he was hospitalized.

176
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,232
What?

177
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,358
I don't know.

178
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,317
Are you sure?

179
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,820
- I just got a notification.
- No way.

180
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,531
No, no, no.

181
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,865
I can't accept it.

182
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,289
Naoki! Tell us what's going on!

183
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,835
Please say you're okay!

184
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,295
Naoki!

185
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,274
Everyone.

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,901
Sorry for shocking you.

187
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,870
When Toya was stabbed…

188
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,416
In the end,

189
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,460
life isn't about probabilities.

190
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,422
Even if you're not sick,

191
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,050
I've come to realize
you could still die tomorrow.

192
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,185
These hearts of ours

193
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,980
beat today as if it's only natural.

194
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,028
But, for example,

195
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,656
if we try to move it by will,

196
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,367
try to stop it,

197
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,746
we'll find we can't.

198
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,501
It's like it doesn't belong to us.

199
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,214
Almost as if some mysterious force
keeps it going.

200
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,927
Each heart ticking out its own BPM,

201
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,762
its own rhythm of life.

202
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,520
And so…

203
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,566
because of that,

204
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,195
no one knows when it will end.

205
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,991
By some whim of the gods,

206
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,498
maybe that moment
will come out of nowhere.

207
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,958
I can't accept it, Naoki!

208
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,709
Please don't say that!

209
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,877
But still…

210
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,423
we do know something.

211
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,970
That rush in our chest

212
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,931
when you see someone you love.

213
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,017
That tightening in your chest…

214
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,772
when you hear a favorite song.

215
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,402
The people we love,

216
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,737
the music we believe in…

217
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,573
they give this heartbeat

218
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,827
more strength.

219
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,705
They make it more real.

220
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,750
This sound of life

221
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,170
undeniably belongs to us.

222
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,191
In this world

223
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,527
where there are no promises
about tomorrow,

224
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,446
I'm here now…

225
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,701
because I wanted to share

226
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,745
this sound with you.

227
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,705
Naoki!

228
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,170
Thank you for listening.

229
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,965
If you'd like, sing with us.

230
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,160
<i>Stay here, 'cause nowhere is better</i>

231
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,497
<i>I overlooked the sounds</i>
<i>That meant the most</i>

232
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,086
<i>A rhythm that's ours alone</i>
<i>Is beating eternally</i>

233
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,882
<i>Like a concert, the beat never stops</i>

234
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,884
<i>Chasing blurry lines</i>

235
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,886
<i>You know you are…</i>

236
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,681
<i>You are beautiful</i>

237
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,768
<i>Just us breaking all the rules</i>

238
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,483
<i>With you, there's no waste of time</i>

239
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,026
<i>You know</i>

240
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:37,741
<i>The reason we exist will never fade</i>

241
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,701
<i>It's right here, forever</i>

242
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:44,915
<i>Yeah, we're chasing blurry lines</i>

243
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,880
<i>Daydreams could never be better</i>

244
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,259
<i>Amid the chaos of everyday life</i>

245
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,761
<i>All I want is proof</i>

246
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,098
<i>That I am truly alive</i>

247
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,644
<i>Something that nobody can take from me</i>

248
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,688
<i>Scream it to the sky</i>

249
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,816
<i>You say no one's there for me</i>

250
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,069
<i>I say you're just what I need</i>

251
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:19,449
<i>I could scream it forever</i>
<i>But my voice won't fade</i>

252
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,786
<i>Any face you show</i>

253
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,539
<i>Any smile you wear</i>

254
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,709
<i>It's all right there</i>

255
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:34,673
<i>I'm not afraid of anything anymore</i>

256
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,637
<i>I realized-wherever my happiness was</i>

257
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,181
<i>You were always standing by its side</i>

258
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,057
<i>That's why I feel I have to say this.</i>

259
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,563
Don't be afraid of my music anymore.

260
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,357
You're not alone.

261
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,693
Let's do our best together!

262
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,406
You think you've beaten me?

263
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,367
<i>Ichidai.</i>

264
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>Music isn't a tool for winning or losing.</i>

265
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,083
<i>It doesn't declare victory or defeat.</i>

266
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,710
<i>It just plays.</i>

267
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,256
That's what makes it so terrifying

268
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,925
and so beautiful.

269
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,052
<i>Chasing blurry lines</i>

270
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,138
<i>You are, you are beautiful</i>

271
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,350
<i>Chasing blurry lines</i>

272
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,186
<i>You are, you are beautiful</i>

273
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,688
Thank you.

274
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,190
Make sure you come back!

275
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,864
<i>Chasing blurry lines</i>

276
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,407
This is the last song.

277
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,004
Thank you.

278
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,924
What is this?

279
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,844
Oh, I know.

280
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,638
It's love.

281
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,350
We love you, Naoki!

282
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,231
Naoki!

283
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,365
I've always been alone.

284
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,743
I confess,

285
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,871
ever since long ago, I…

286
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,041
No matter who I performed music with,

287
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,835
I was always alone.

288
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,882
My music hurt so many people.

289
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,888
Shattered so many fragile hearts
like glass.

290
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,309
And I lived by feeding off the sparkle
of those broken pieces.

291
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,229
I hated that about myself.

292
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,398
It scared me.

293
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,278
I thought I should just
lock myself away and disappear.

294
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,201
But then,

295
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,454
Sho showed me what it means
to be in a band.

296
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,042
Kazushi's music

297
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,087
unlocked the door to my room.

298
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,256
Akane's drumming

299
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,301
gives me the strength to live.

300
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,888
Everyone's love

301
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,059
is what keeps TENBLANK going.

302
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,396
I'm not alone anymore.

303
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,858
I love you all too.

304
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,446
TENBLANK…

305
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,784
will only ever play the sound of love.

306
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,838
<i>There's a song I could hear</i>

307
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,842
<i>Since before I was born</i>

308
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,720
<i>Though it had everything</i>

309
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,683
<i>It had no shape or form</i>

310
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,411
<i>Nameless emotions</i>

311
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,457
<i>Coalesced to make me</i>

312
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,794
<i>If that's true</i>

313
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,256
<i>Then there's nothing to fear</i>

314
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,260
<i>There are no wrong notes</i>

315
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:34,097
<i>With just that unwavering truth</i>

316
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:40,270
<i>I thought I could live in this cruel world</i>

317
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,855
<i>Tell me why you never</i>

318
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:46,401
<i>Say anything</i>

319
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,363
<i>Even though you always ask "why?"</i>

320
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,326
<i>Why does this silence</i>

321
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,371
<i>Get so noisy and wild?</i>

322
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,083
<i>You never say anything</i>

323
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,962
<i>Even though you always ask "why?"</i>

324
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,216
<i>Don't stay silent, come on</i>

325
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:15,222
<i>And break through the stillness</i>

326
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,493
<i>Today too</i>
<i>The city breathes out fresh sounds</i>

327
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,161
<i>Merging as one</i>

328
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:42,374
<i>Among the countless melodies</i>

329
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,585
<i>I heard your voice cut through</i>

330
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,631
<i>Every time my heartbeat quickens</i>

331
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,385
<i>The end draws closer</i>

332
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:57,389
<i>But if my life is to be broken</i>

333
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,182
<i>I hope it's by you</i>

334
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,393
<i>Tell me why</i>

335
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,644
<i>You never say anything…</i>

336
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,020
GOD, THANK YOU FOR TENBLANK

337
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,564
Thank you

338
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,941
for being with me.

339
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,653
Thank you

340
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,447
for being TENBLANK.

341
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,662
<i>You never say anything</i>

342
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,749
<i>Even though you always ask "why?"</i>

343
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,169
<i>Tear your destiny to pieces</i>

344
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:33,216
<i>With your own two hands</i>

345
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,233
I've found it.

346
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,777
Something important.

347
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,821
I won't let go of it.

348
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,991
We

349
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,577
will be back again, no matter what!

350
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,454
Until that day,

351
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,914
we'll each go through our own battles.

352
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,958
So let's make a promise today.

353
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,418
Until we meet again,

354
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,004
we will never lose.

355
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,507
We'll overcome it all no matter what!
We'll survive!

356
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,136
And let's sing together again.

357
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,399
<i>In the gaps of a fading night</i>

358
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,779
<i>Your voice echoes</i>

359
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:40,950
<i>Unfulfilled wishes</i>
<i>Scatter beautifully today too</i>

360
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:49,250
<i>Even though you and I</i>
<i>Met through a humdrum fate</i>

361
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:56,257
<i>We kick it aside and soar higher together</i>

362
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,887
<i>Echoing out in each and every</i>
<i>Fleeting moment</i>

363
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,641
<i>There's a sound</i>
<i>That's even new to God's ears</i>

364
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:09,604
<i>As long as I'm with you</i>
<i>We can make that sound</i>

365
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:16,653
<i>I've got that feeling</i>

366
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:24,828
<i>I've got that feeling</i>

367
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,415
<i>I've got that feeling2</i>

368
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,664
Come back!

369
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,806
