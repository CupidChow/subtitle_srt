1
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,270
Sensei, should I try a different phrasing?

2
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,731
No, no! Don't stop!

3
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,317
Now. Now, now…

4
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,278
The words…

5
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,285
<i>Love is vague</i>

6
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,260
<i>Love is vague</i>

7
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,305
<i>You can't even see it</i>

8
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,601
<i>The reason the two of us were born</i>

9
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,772
<i>We entrust in the sound</i>

10
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,524
So?

11
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,153
Yeah, sounds good. Right?

12
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,696
Yeah.

13
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,989
Let's go!

14
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,579
Nice, Akane. That's the fighting spirit.

15
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,705
Thanks!

16
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,623
Yeah.

17
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,671
We're leaving, Sensei.

18
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,803
The person in charge of <i>Music Time</i>
has always been a stickler for time.

19
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,224
Then you've got a recording and a promo.

20
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,352
What kind of math are you using
to cram in other work?

21
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,563
You got this, Gen! Thanks!

22
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,814
You…

23
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,065
Are we twinning today?

24
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:34,195
Seriously, you should ease up
on your schedule a bit.

25
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,072
Are you listening?

26
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,326
Have you and Genji known each other
for a long time?

27
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,747
Yeah, he was a roadie
when I joined the industry.

28
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,713
It's his first time as a manager,
but he's trustworthy.

29
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,592
Well, it looks like Naoki will be carrying
the load until Genji settles in.

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,595
That just shows how much work
Miyako was doing.

31
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,558
Well, I'm heading out.

32
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,517
No, wait, wait.

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,562
Oh, okay. I'm going to keep practicing.

34
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,522
There's that fighting spirit.

35
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,441
I like it.

36
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,276
Good work today.

37
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,382
Sensei.

38
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,887
I…

39
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,556
I think that…

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,515
Akane.

41
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,566
There's a sound…

42
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,071
resonating inside me.

43
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,282
I think that I

44
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,411
was born to play that sound.

45
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,957
Music…

46
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,170
Music is the only thing I live for.

47
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,341
The only way I can live.

48
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,525
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,600
<i>I'm fine.</i>

50
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,602
<i>Totally fine.</i>

51
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,730
<i>Because,</i>

52
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,732
<i>for me,</i>

53
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,775
<i>there's music.</i>

54
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,130
<i>This afternoon, around 4:00 p.m.,</i>
<i>in Tokyo's Ota Ward,</i>

55
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,258
<i>a woman was attacked with a blade</i>
<i>on the street and sustained injuries.</i>

56
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,634
Here you go.

57
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,136
Thank you.

58
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,599
Here. Sorry I kept you late.

59
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,478
Well, I was practicing too.

60
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,857
Let's dig in.

61
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,320
Tasty.

62
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,201
I wonder why Ms. Kai quit so suddenly.

63
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,412
Well, knowing her, she's probably fine.

64
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,499
Yeah, I think so too.

65
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,793
Ow.

66
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,462
The skin on my hand peeled off again.

67
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,757
Whoa! Ow! What was that for?

68
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,926
You're overdoing it.

69
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,969
Or rather, you're so obvious.

70
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,472
Huh? What is?

71
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,807
That hair.

72
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,433
Huh? What? Is it weird?

73
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,560
It's not that.

74
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,191
Something happened between you and Naoki.

75
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,902
You're really gonna ask?

76
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,280
Actually…

77
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,618
This might surprise you, but…

78
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,956
Sensei rejected me.

79
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,168
- Figures.
- Figures!

80
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,631
Well, I didn't actually confess,
and I'm already totally fine.

81
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,802
You should stay away from him.

82
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,138
Huh?

83
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,434
Well, I mean…

84
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,563
I just think it's unreasonable.

85
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,523
Huh?

86
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,609
What's that supposed to mean?
You sure say complicated things.

87
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,279
What? You're just too simple.

88
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,908
For real, Toya is so cool!

89
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,952
Right? OVER CHROME is the best!

90
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,078
Right? For real.

91
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,081
That's intense.

92
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,208
Huh?

93
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,589
Whoa, that's the worst.

94
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,174
What's wrong?

95
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,264
It's the same release date as us.

96
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,682
It is.

97
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,816
What?

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,943
Why do you have his contact info?

99
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,153
TOYA SHINZAKI
NEW MESSAGE

100
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,280
NEW SONG
OC_NO29.WAV

101
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,698
"New song."

102
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:22,793
<i>The reluctant waning moon drifts above</i>
<i>Blotting out the crescent</i>

103
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,923
<i>A shaking, shaking</i>

104
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,384
<i>Quivering voice</i>

105
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:37,475
<i>Sang out in full vibrato</i>

106
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,981
<i>The frustrations and struggles</i>

107
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,401
<i>Of my past</i>

108
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:54,242
<i>Surely made me who I am</i>

109
00:08:55,993 --> 00:09:01,165
<i>I vowed to this formless love</i>

110
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,044
So,

111
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,340
Toya Shinzaki plagiarized Naoki's song?

112
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,509
It can only be that.

113
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,179
No way they'd have the exact same melody
at the same exact time.

114
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,349
But still,
would he do something like that?

115
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,479
- Here you are.
- Oh. Thank you.

116
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,568
Wow, Sho and Kazushi in the flesh
are so cool.

117
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,860
Hey, quit it, Momoko.

118
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:34,615
Why? They look out for you,
so your mother should at least say hello.

119
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,536
No, we should've visited sooner.
Thank you for your support.

120
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,121
- Same here.
- Thank you.

121
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,163
Thank you.

122
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,250
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

123
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,209
Thank you.

124
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,635
Don't mention this to Naoki.

125
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,929
What? Why?

126
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,640
If Naoki finds out, he'll scrap the song.

127
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,643
- He can't do that!
- For now, let's record it right away.

128
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,938
Let's. We're the innocent ones anyway.

129
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,484
As long as we protect that song,
the rest can be dealt with later.

130
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,086
Oh, Yukino.

131
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,424
How was Naoki's vacation home?

132
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,095
Is there anything
you've been keeping from me?

133
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,144
If so, then tell me.

134
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,819
Why?

135
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,156
What do you mean, "why"?

136
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,492
We

137
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,036
are not equals.

138
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,998
- Huh?
- There seems to be a misunderstanding.

139
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,377
Your opinion means nothing.

140
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,638
<i>It's too bad.</i>
<i>I used up all of Naoki's songs on you.</i>

141
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,891
<i>All the songs he left are gone.</i>

142
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,060
<i>Do you understand?</i>

143
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,613
I am

144
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,408
the one

145
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,452
letting you sing.

146
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,005
You'd better not forget that.

147
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,186
It's dangerous, so stand back!

148
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,313
Stand back!

149
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,166
If you get it, let us through.

150
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,339
Toya!

151
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,181
You give the fans
too much attention, Toya.

152
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,518
They don't know how hard it would be
to fall in love with you.

153
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,854
Better than falling for you.

154
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,523
It's a pity either way.

155
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,527
It's fine. They live off my songs.

READ: NEW SONG OC_NO.WAV

158
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,790
Infuriating woman.

159
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,960
Who?

160
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:15,878
What?

161
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,380
She's a nuisance.

162
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,301
The girl who's slowing down your work.

163
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,845
I'm not telling you a damn thing.

164
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,077
Good morning.

165
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,161
Good morning.

166
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,420
So, your mind is made up?

167
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,548
Yeah.

168
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,646
Huh? What happened?

169
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,524
We're not recording today.

170
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,862
The song from the other day
is getting taken off the album.

171
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,821
What? Why?

172
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,782
Ask the one who decided it.

173
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,160
Sensei.

174
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,039
Did you perhaps hear Toya's song?

175
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,958
Yeah. I did.

176
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,711
There's no need to stir up trouble.

177
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,753
Why?

178
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:44,550
Why do we have to let go of our song
because OVER CHROME has the same one?

179
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,427
It's fine. We have other songs.

180
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,636
You say that

181
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,265
because you're not aware
of the quality of your own work.

182
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,892
Well, but…

183
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,519
I already have a new song
playing in my head.

184
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,688
I can write them endlessly.

185
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,816
I don't have to be set on that one song.

186
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,587
Lies.

187
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,798
Sensei.

188
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,800
Time for your press interview.

189
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,263
Sorry, it's already been decided.

190
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,390
Don't come here after leaving me on read.

191
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,560
I wanted to meet and have a proper talk.

192
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,898
You like me, don't you?

193
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,195
The song you sent me is the song
Sensei wrote for TENBLANK.

194
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,992
It has the same melody as our new song.

195
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,956
Oh yeah?

196
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,040
Why is that?

197
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,252
Did you steal Sensei's song?

198
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,379
You want me to kill you?

199
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,924
Sensei said he's not going
to release the song.

200
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,013
But I refuse to give up on that song.

201
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,685
That sound is extremely important to him.

202
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,733
And?

203
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,360
So…

204
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,363
Please change your song!

205
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,908
What?!

206
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:17,911
Please!

207
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,128
What?

208
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,631
That's what you've come to say to me?

209
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,759
Yes.

210
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:44,021
So he's holding back his track
because it's got the same melody as mine?

211
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,273
That's correct.

212
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,484
What a dumbass.

213
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,111
Come.

214
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,615
Hey, how's it going, Genius?

215
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,033
He's at an interview--

216
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,622
Come on, now.
What kind of song did you write?

217
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,123
Sing it now.

218
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,833
Hey, man.

219
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,044
Sing it.

220
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,130
I said sing it!

221
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,383
Oh, yeah?

222
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,426
Then

223
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,221
let me use Akane Saijo.

224
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,056
What?

225
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,643
I won't give her back even if you cry.

226
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,442
Welcome.

227
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,164
Hey.

228
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,417
Is this her?

229
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,670
Your bottleneck?

230
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,339
Hey, wanna hear something funny?

231
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,718
If it'll help you get work done,
then be my guest.

232
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,596
The song I wrote

233
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,934
and the song Naoki Fujitani wrote
have the same melody.

234
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,395
And they drop the same day.

235
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,106
Wow.

236
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,275
That's the worst.

237
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,901
Huh?

238
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,572
You should withdraw.

239
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,448
No way.

240
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,908
Um…

241
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,453
Did you really not know
it had the same melody?

242
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,707
The song was a struggle to complete.

243
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,294
If I'd known,
I would've recommended a different song.

244
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,671
Then, how?

245
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,508
Hey, Akane Saijo.

246
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,178
Enough. Play us your song. It's not fair.

247
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,429
- What?
- I see.

248
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,141
That's good. Please let us hear it.

249
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,603
We have every instrument imaginable,
so take your pick.

250
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,857
That song has to be with the band,

251
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,901
otherwise I can't.

252
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,906
Seriously.

253
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,993
That stubbornness of yours…

254
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,166
is just like him, and it pisses me off.

255
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,677
Sorry for barging in.

256
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,804
Um…

257
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,933
She's ours, so give her back.

258
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,528
Akane, let's go.

259
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,571
Oh. Okay.

260
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,908
You seriously came
all the way here just for her?

261
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,825
That's right.

262
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,787
Are you dumb? Is your brain fried?

263
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,121
Yeah? You think so?

264
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,706
Don't screw with me. It is.

265
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,625
Why aren't you putting out the song?

266
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,795
You're just letting me do it?

267
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,129
Makes me sick.

268
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,090
So that's what you're mad about.

269
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,260
You've always been like that.

270
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,470
You don't get what's important.

271
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,264
What is it I don't get?

272
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,642
Don't underestimate my talent!

273
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,442
Let's battle it out.

274
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,070
For real this time.

275
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,864
Because I will crush you.

276
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,325
Just die.

277
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:30,956
Okay.

278
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,624
Then let's do it.

279
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,836
Let's settle it on stage.
The audience decides.

280
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,753
What?

281
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,257
The winner releases their song.

282
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,800
What? Hold on.

283
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,218
Unbelievable.

284
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,433
It's nice and simple.

285
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,852
It's perfect. Look.

286
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:55,230
Play your song now on this piano.

287
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,571
So this is where it was.

288
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,791
When Toya was nine,

289
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,960
he sandwiched his fingers here.

290
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,420
Huh?

291
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,214
You knew each other
since you were that little?

292
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,843
You didn't know?
He's my older brother. Different mothers.

293
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,261
What?

294
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,348
He's right. We're brothers.

295
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,934
What?!

296
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,358
So it's only natural that Toya's melody
is the same as mine.

297
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,153
Toya's mom taught it to us.

298
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,280
It's a cherished tune.

299
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,326
So that's how it is.

300
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,249
I never thought
I'd get to touch this piano again.

301
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,087
Just get on with it
and play already, big bro.

302
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,964
I can, but I'm not any good.

303
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,804
Well, okay.

304
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,473
I'll play it just once.

305
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,600
But…

306
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,236
this will be the only time
I play it in my lifetime.

307
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,821
Good?

308
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,123
It's so sad,

309
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,833
this sound.

310
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,768
<i>A music god…</i>

311
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,467
That's enough, right?

312
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,809
Let's go, Akane.

313
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,061
Okay.

314
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,016
I still don't like you.

315
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,436
Oh, yeah? I'm sorry.

316
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,895
Your music

317
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,189
does make people unhappy.

318
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,152
But

319
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,450
if you think that your music
made Toya unhappy,

320
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,037
then that's just arrogance.

321
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,790
You're right.

322
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,052
Naoki must really like you.

323
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,511
What?

324
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,723
Bye.

325
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,539
Sensei.

326
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,419
Sensei?

327
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,631
- Sensei.
- I said to wait!

328
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,591
Sensei.

329
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,261
Sensei!

330
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,520
Sorry for walking away so quickly.

331
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,316
I don't like being told I'm not liked.
So I ran away.

332
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,740
I don't think anyone likes being disliked.

333
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,949
Yeah.

334
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,243
But people just deal with it.

335
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,164
I guess I'm more fragile than most.

336
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,793
But

337
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,672
I'm glad someone is by Toya's side.

338
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,383
I…

339
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,929
messed up working
with someone I care about.

340
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,352
I took some missteps.

341
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,733
I did something bad.

342
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,658
<i>Why is it that a person</i>
<i>who lives only for music</i>

343
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,703
<i>is like that?</i>

344
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,998
<i>Apologizing. Enduring.</i>

345
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,959
<i>Thinking alone.</i>

346
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,212
<i>Deciding alone.</i>

347
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,798
<i>Being kind.</i>

348
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,132
Sensei!

349
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,430
<i>I thought… he's not a god.</i>

350
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,813
<i>I want to…</i>

351
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,025
I…

352
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,194
love you, Sensei!

353
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,117
Um, not just me.

354
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,661
Everyone.

355
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,287
Sho too.

356
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,789
Kazushi too.

357
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,000
Every one of us in TENBLANK loves you.

358
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,172
No matter who else doesn't like you.

359
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,299
No matter who you make unhappy.

360
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,010
I…

361
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,889
I've never wanted to make music
with someone this badly before.

362
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,604
I'm not saying it well.

363
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,278
You're strong on your own, but

364
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,990
if it's the four of us,
we could be even stronger.

365
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,118
I think we could do anything.

366
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,622
That's cool.

367
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,666
It's like we're the Avengers.

368
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,345
The crossing's closing!

369
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,011
Your piano playing

370
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,388
had a sad sound.

371
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,015
Yeah.

372
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,059
I do have an unpleasant way of playing.

373
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,688
But it changed partway through.

374
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,276
It sparkled and shined.

375
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,322
On that piano earlier…

376
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,533
I played to your sound partway through.

377
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:33,952
Huh?

378
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,123
<i>Your rhythm.</i>

379
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,834
<i>Sho's riffs.</i>

380
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,795
<i>Kazushi's arrangements.</i>

381
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,672
<i>I played to those sounds.</i>

382
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,426
<i>That's what I like.</i>

383
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,055
That piano playing

384
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,599
was TENBLANK's sound.

385
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:36,431
DREAM MUSIC STUDIO PRE-SURVEY

386
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,061
What's wrong?

387
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,817
You've been acting strange
ever since coming back from Naoki's place.

388
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,611
Did something happen?

389
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,573
My songs…

390
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
Every single one of them

391
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,663
was written by Naoki Fujitani.

392
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:06,711
Isagi made me sing those songs
under his own name.

393
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,051
ICHIDAI ISAGI

394
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,469
But if I go against him…

395
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,139
I won't survive this industry.

396
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,228
<i>Yukino?</i>

397
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,149
Yes?

398
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,777
<i>I'll prepare you a new song.</i>

399
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,863
<i>So don't you go running off now</i>

400
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,156
<i>like Naoki.</i>

401
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,850
KUMA
TOYA, LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR SHOW!

402
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,700
Excuse me.

403
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,578
Toya seems to be late.

404
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,125
It's a special day.

405
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,169
He's probably a little too fired up.

406
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,550
I will come back later. Excuse me.

407
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,488
Toya…

408
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,661
What do you want?

409
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:49,053
