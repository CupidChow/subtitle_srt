1
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
Whoa, great vibes!

2
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,285
If you're making a band album,
a retreat is a must, right?

3
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,703
I'm looking forward to it.

4
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,205
Is that how it is?

5
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,416
Who knows?
We're basically a group of loners.

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,501
Here, carry this.

7
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,337
I didn't know you had
a vacation home like this.

8
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,756
It was my parents'.
I only bought it from them.

9
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,925
Nowadays I barely use it.

10
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,018
Huh?

11
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,692
- What?
- Just take it already.

12
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,530
By the way, why did you bring a pillow?

13
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,198
Why didn't you bring one?

14
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,283
- So heavy.
- You okay?

15
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,412
This will be your room, okay?

16
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,208
Whoa! This room is so cute!

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,421
<i>The truth is, I knew from the beginning…</i>

18
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,887
<i>that I was captivated by him.</i>

19
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,724
<i>But…</i>

20
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,644
<i>I didn't want to know.</i>

21
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,780
Yeah.

22
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,949
That's a nice breeze.

23
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,661
Oh, by the way, Akane,

24
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,872
can you make some time tonight?

25
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,789
Huh?

26
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,500
Come to my room.

27
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,128
What?!

28
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,965
Let's have a pillow fight.

29
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,343
Huh?

30
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,137
I've always dreamt of having one.

31
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,723
Two against two.
Oh, we can team up, Akane.

32
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,018
Will the losing team get a penalty?

33
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,394
Of course.

34
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,980
Let's do it. A really brutal penalty.

35
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,398
Twelve TV appearance requests,

36
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,192
and we've also got some offers
for brand deals and tie-ins.

37
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,029
I've already picked the ones
that match TENBLANK's image, so now…

38
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,282
Again.

39
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,326
Hello, Miyako from BEAT speaking.
Thank you for your call.

40
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,287
Yes, thank you.

41
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,665
I'll confirm and call you back.

42
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,209
Yes. Have a good day.

43
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,050
I heard from Sensei that we would create
the album here and send it to you.

44
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,343
So why did you come?

45
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,848
Right now, things are going
according to Naoki's plan,

46
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,850
but it won't be like that in the future.

47
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,602
Different agendas are coming into play.

48
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,854
Both good and bad.

49
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,065
My job is to protect you
from those things.

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,362
They haven't found the culprit
behind the <i>Music States </i>incident, right?

51
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,615
Right.

52
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,410
It's a fact that someone
is trying to destroy TENBLANK.

53
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,122
Ms. Saijo was also scared.

54
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,498
Right?

55
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,959
Scared?

56
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,896
Ms. Saijo, are you listening to me?

57
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,481
Oh, sorry.

58
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,486
How can you be so carefree
after going through that?

59
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:08,576
But doesn't it mean
that someone appreciated my sound?

60
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,370
What?

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,206
I mean, they thought
that if I weren't there,

62
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,583
the live show would fail, right?

63
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,085
That someone.

64
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,881
They thought that without me,
TENBLANK would be over.

65
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,011
If that were the case,
I'd feel a bit honored.

66
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,687
Okay, everyone.
Let's gather in the studio in 20 minutes.

67
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,314
Yeah, sure.

68
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,069
Okay.

69
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,364
There.

70
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,744
Carefree, huh?

71
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,936
What's with that underwear?

72
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,230
Oh, I got it as a birthday gift from Eiko.

73
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,232
There's no deep meaning.

74
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:25,278
Were you hoping something
might happen at the retreat?

75
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,864
No, not in the slightest.

76
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,242
Besides, there's no way Naoki
would be interested in someone like me.

77
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,203
You never know.

78
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,582
I mean, if you ate
Italian or French food all the time,

79
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,376
wouldn't you want to eat natto
or pickles sometimes?

80
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,752
Those are both smelly things!

81
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,841
Be careful.

82
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,179
You've been around enough to know,

83
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,848
but dating within the band…

84
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,851
Even if the romance goes well,

85
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,146
it could end up tearing apart the band.

86
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,488
I'm completely aware of that.

87
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,951
Oh.

88
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,038
Could these be Sensei's height marks?

89
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,043
Whoa! So short!

90
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,754
How cute!

91
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,595
What about this one?

92
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,606
Oh my gosh. This is too adorable.

93
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,569
So, about the song in question.

94
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,779
Take a listen.

95
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,452
What?

96
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,625
Wait, you're joking.

97
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,920
I wouldn't play it to you if I were.
This is your song, Kazushi.

98
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,432
You know, I want to include this song
on our next album at any cost.

99
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,727
If no one objects, I'll just add lyrics
and sing it as is. Thoughts?

100
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,610
Excuse me, Sensei. This whole recording…

101
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,611
Yeah.

102
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,990
There was no time, so I made it by myself.

103
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,032
Sorry.

104
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,619
- This arrangement?
- Complaints?

105
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,579
- Plenty!
- Where?

106
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,539
The song wasn't like this, was it?

107
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,583
It was definitely not like this!

108
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,464
Right.

109
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,676
Your version is beautiful.

110
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,846
It's very beautiful, but it won't do.

111
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,848
What won't do?

112
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,602
Listen, Kazushi.

113
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,606
What do you think happens
if your song is heard like this?

114
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,414
This song wasn't made
to be listened to so carelessly.

115
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,666
But that's what most people do.

116
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,963
They don't even know
what hi-res or lossless means.

117
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,258
They listen through their phone speaker
or a pair of cheap earphones.

118
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,553
Say all those people are idiots,
and we would be out of business.

119
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,555
No point being with a major label, surely.

120
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,265
Of course I know that.

121
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,060
The delicate way you create sound now?

122
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,855
It's an impressive weapon.

123
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,691
I won't tell you to change that.

124
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,944
But what do you want
to communicate with it?

125
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,865
People need to hear
something more focused.

126
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,452
You try to show everything
with a wide-angle lens

127
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,789
while hiding the real treasure
in the landscape.

128
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,292
But few people will notice that,
even though there is treasure there.

129
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,005
That's…

130
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:13,964
It's a waste.

131
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,513
You say you know how people feel
when handling their own music,

132
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,601
but not everyone can set up
clever tricks from the start like you!

133
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,560
That's right.

134
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,564
I'm more of a genius.

135
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,066
So what?

136
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,031
You can't handicap me.

137
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,492
That's not how music works.

138
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,375
I want to rearrange it.

139
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,626
When would it be ready?

140
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,004
I can take care of it in half a day.

141
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,717
That's fine.

142
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,677
Show it to me when it's done.

143
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,524
Despite how he seems…

144
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,781
I think he really sees you as a rival.

145
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,367
Most likely.

146
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,167
Being seen as a rival by someone like him

147
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,252
is just a nuisance.

148
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,096
We've arrived!

149
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,601
This is fine. I'll contact you
when it's time to go back.

150
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,810
Yes. Understood.

151
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,812
- Ms. Yukino, here.
- Oh, thank you.

152
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,190
Hello!

153
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,150
Why have you come here?

154
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,193
Nobody told me.

155
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,321
I came because Naoki called me.

156
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,743
Is your permission even needed, Manager?

157
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,334
Oh! Naoki, I'm here!

158
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,419
Thanks for the invite!

159
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,672
Why is Yukino Sakurai here?

160
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,384
Well, there's this song
where I want female vocals.

161
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,220
But isn't she working with Isagi?

162
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,930
- No matter how popular--
- Miyako.

163
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,475
I need her voice for this album.

164
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,353
That's all there is to it.

165
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,828
Everyone is talking about
those chocolates right now.

166
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,787
Really?

167
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,375
I wanted to talk more with you, Akane.

168
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:56,919
Huh?

169
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,046
I…

170
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,384
I became a TENBLANK fan.

171
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,304
You're amazing, Akane.

172
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,890
You're so pretty, but you play hardcore.

173
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,850
Really?

174
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,518
Hello.

175
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,313
Be real. Ms. Sakurai
is obviously more attractive.

176
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,983
Huh? What should I do? I got a compliment.

177
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,486
I'm saying you've got
a terrible personality.

178
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,041
- Um…
- But I'm not lying.

179
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,420
You're really cute.

180
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,340
At least, much more than I was back then.

181
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,175
Huh?

182
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,220
I've had work done.

183
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,474
At one point, I kept failing auditions.

184
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,271
I thought maybe it was because of my face,
so I fixed it.

185
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,234
There's no way my singing was the issue.

186
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
I…

187
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,328
I love my singing.

188
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,706
That's why I want to love myself
more and more.

189
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,171
If I were singing a song
by Naoki Fujitani,

190
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,051
I just know I'd love myself even more.

191
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,309
Sorry for the wait. Shall we go?

192
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,435
Oh, he's here!

193
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,812
Seriously, I've been waiting forever!

194
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,868
She's

195
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,079
really something.

196
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,375
You're okay with leaving them alone?

197
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:00,918
Huh?

198
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,723
I'm sorry this is sudden, but…

199
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,686
can you sing?

200
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,566
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

201
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,152
<i>Closer by your side</i>

202
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,655
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

203
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,865
<i>Feeling the heat from your body</i>

204
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,326
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

205
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,412
<i>No rush, taking our time</i>

206
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,415
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

207
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,096
<i>Our blushing faces</i>

208
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,056
<i>Reflected in cups full of tea</i>

209
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,143
<i>Who are you looking at</i>

210
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,687
<i>Pretending you don't know?</i>

211
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,981
<i>Our gazes cross</i>

212
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,108
<i>Full of warmth</i>

213
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,569
<i>Every time I trace</i>

214
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,363
<i>The day we first met</i>

215
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>A refreshing squall falls smooth</i>
<i>Passing through</i>

216
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,539
<i>Dried-out macaroni tells the time</i>

217
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,208
<i>A refreshing squall</i>

218
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,711
<i>Leads us toward our goal</i>

219
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,088
<i>A teasing scent</i>

220
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,008
<i>Brushes over pale skin</i>

221
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,093
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

222
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,304
<i>Closer by your side</i>

223
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,182
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

224
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,684
<i>Feeling the heat from your body</i>

225
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,978
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

226
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,272
<i>No rush, taking our time</i>

227
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,858
<i>I want to sing with you</i>

228
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,415
How are they doing?

229
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,833
It seems to be going well.

230
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,930
What's the problem?
I was gonna give up anyway.

231
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:31,170
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

232
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,757
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

233
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

234
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,726
<i>It's the same for you and me…</i>

235
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,150
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,278
I was surprised by your beautiful voice.

237
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,912
I was supposed to sing in Naoki's band.

238
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,038
Huh?

239
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,958
But then he said
he would rather sing himself.

240
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,256
Don't worry, I have no regrets anymore.

241
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,678
- Let me help.
- No need.

242
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,348
Making dinner is the only way
I can be useful.

243
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,849
That's not true.

244
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,980
Naoki's vocals are

245
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,067
the real deal.

246
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:42,658
That's why I believe it's strategically
better for TENBLANK if he sings.

247
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,540
No matter what,
I'll make TENBLANK succeed.

248
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,630
Otherwise…

249
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,593
the dream I let go of
won't be able to rest in peace.

250
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,973
Let me help.

251
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,599
No need.

252
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,351
- No, I'll help.
- I'm okay.

253
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,395
- Please let me help.
- It's seriously fine.

254
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,146
So, what should I do?

255
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,569
Have a drink, Yukino.

256
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,570
- Thank you.
- Here.

257
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,449
Barbecues are so exciting!

258
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,203
Are you even planning on lifting a finger?

259
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,290
Having me grill
would be sacrilege to Wagyu beef.

260
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,207
I see.

261
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,376
These sausages are delicious!

262
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,419
Here's round two.

263
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,920
Thank you.

264
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,097
It's delicious!

265
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,939
Sorry for the wait. Meat delivery.

266
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,236
No good idea will come to you
if you don't fuel your brain.

267
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,658
Wanna hear it?

268
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,076
Can I?

269
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,990
This is your original song.
Nothing has changed.

270
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,585
I like this song.

271
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,891
Thank you.

272
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,936
I mean it.

273
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,355
The elegant piano arrangement

274
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,273
and the hook--

275
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,192
That's not what it was about!

276
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,194
Kazushi?

277
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,613
All that "major label" stuff?

278
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,908
He couldn't care less about that.

279
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,537
I get it now.

280
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:39,126
I'd made a fundamental mistake.

281
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,007
The way I originally wrote it

282
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,095
wouldn't let your drumming shine.

283
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,182
But with his arrangement,

284
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,229
he made it so that the best parts
of your sound lock in with the song.

285
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,107
Oh.

286
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,196
I'm sure you could adjust to make it work,
but that'd be boring.

287
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,660
Akane…

288
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,247
He wants you to go crazier.

289
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,124
That's what Naoki wants.

290
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,544
I'm sorry.

291
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,717
Why are you apologizing?

292
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,888
I just didn't understand
what it meant to be in a band.

293
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,687
Oh.

294
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,782
That guy…

295
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,702
He really wants to be in a band.

296
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,163
Yeah.

297
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:04,628
Honestly, I used to think
people who played in a band were idiots.

298
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,088
I took you for a major idiot.

299
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,423
What?

300
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,800
But, you know,

301
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,345
doing this together with someone

302
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,598
has become fun.

303
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,309
Besides…

304
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,690
I get to clash sounds with Naoki Fujitani,
a powerful rival.

305
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,691
I get it.

306
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:32,197
He may be on another level,
but going head-to-head with him is fun.

307
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,282
But lately…

308
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,870
things have been a bit of a mess.

309
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,081
I can imagine.

310
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,459
Because you have romantic feelings.

311
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,461
Huh?

312
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,422
Hey, are you okay with that?

313
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,382
Huh?

314
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,558
I'll go after all.

315
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,468
- You ate up that asparagus.
- Yup.

316
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,095
Good job eating your vegetables.

317
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:59,386
This is neither Kazushi's nor Sensei's.

318
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,846
This is TENBLANK's sound.

319
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,907
<i>I'm overflowing with sounds</i>

320
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,244
<i>And words I want to convey</i>

321
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,414
<i>Whether or not I have rare talent</i>

322
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,625
<i>Is up to me</i>

323
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:37,340
<i>Where I want to go isn't that far away</i>

324
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,552
<i>I'm off to find out</i>

325
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,638
<i>If I've got that rare talent</i>

326
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,433
<i>I want to shout it out</i>

327
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:50,645
<i>This unnamed sound</i>
<i>Resonating deep in my throat</i>

328
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,897
<i>I just need to shout it out, shout it out</i>

329
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,108
<i>Until it reaches you</i>

330
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,651
<i>Just play out loud</i>

331
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,329
So you were here.

332
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,671
That song from earlier.

333
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,091
I think we should go
with your arrangement, Naoki.

334
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,849
To me, this band is just
another name for Naoki Fujitani.

335
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,646
You could aim even higher on your own,
so why cover for the other members?

336
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,443
I mean, Ms. Saijo is just an amateur.

337
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,446
She got locked in
because she was too absorbed in drumming.

338
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,909
Hey, Miyako.

339
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,790
How did you know
there were drums on that boat?

340
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,755
That's because…

341
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,512
I guess this is as far as we go.

342
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,531
I…

343
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,702
I…

344
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,085
I found it.

345
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,755
My dream of singing in your band
was taken away.

346
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,633
But I still found another dream.

347
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,678
That dream is making TENBLANK succeed.

348
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,767
I'll do anything for TENBLANK's success.

349
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,352
Even if it seems unfair.

350
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,812
That's why…

351
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,191
You know, I…

352
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,363
I'll get the sound I need for my music,
no matter what.

353
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,075
Sho, Kazushi,

354
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,785
and Akane too.

355
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,956
They play sounds I never imagined.

356
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,333
That's why we are TENBLANK.

357
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,296
But…

358
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,136
I'm sorry.

359
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,639
TENBLANK doesn't need you like this.

360
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,197
Could you go after her?

361
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,715
What do you want?

362
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,551
I can go back by myself.

363
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,303
Come on, let me give you a ride.

364
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,722
Here.

365
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,102
You weren't drinking alcohol, huh?

366
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,439
You were planning to send me back
from the start.

367
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,358
Yeah.

368
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,570
Just how far are you going to go
to humiliate me?

369
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,739
It's not only you.

370
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,075
Naoki too.

371
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,827
And that girl too.

372
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,582
Akane?

373
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,256
You may not believe me,

374
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,094
but I didn't plan to do that.

375
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,640
But…

376
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,646
she was practicing.

377
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,111
<i>I thought she would be nervous</i>
<i>before the live broadcast,</i>

378
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,989
<i>but she was having so much fun.</i>

379
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,908
<i>She started to dive deeper into herself,</i>

380
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,912
<i>and everything outside of the music</i>
<i>seemed to fade.</i>

381
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,585
It reminded me a bit of Naoki.

382
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,259
Before I knew it, I'd shut the door.

383
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,935
I thought Ms. Saijo
would drag TENBLANK down,

384
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,271
so I should have her quit.

385
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,151
But what I was feeling then…

386
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,823
was jealousy.

387
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,366
Clearly.

388
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,954
I can be replaced.

389
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,458
Even Yukino Sakurai
can easily be replaced.

390
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,002
But…

391
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,048
no one can replace

392
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:12,925
Akane Saijo.

393
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,275
I don't plan to go against
the judgement of a genius.

394
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,322
But I…

395
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,369
I liked your vocals.

396
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:54,467
Sensei said he didn't need
you like this, right?

397
00:34:56,052 --> 00:35:00,348
That's a rare remark
from someone who's usually so oblivious.

398
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:07,188
It's like he's saying TENBLANK
<i>would </i>need you if you were different.

399
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,940
Stop the car!

400
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,567
Huh?

401
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,860
Stop the car!

402
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,204
Miyako!

403
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,956
It's dangerous!

404
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,000
- I'll get you to the station.
- Don't make me more miserable!

405
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,460
Miyako.

406
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:43,933
Akane!

407
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,311
Want some face lotion?

408
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,688
I totally recommend this.

409
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,064
Really? Thank you!

410
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,023
Yeah.

411
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,739
You know…

412
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,326
TENBLANK is incredible.

413
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,662
Huh?

414
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,958
You guys felt totally united earlier.

415
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,628
Like you were real partners in sound.

416
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,301
I had the urge to smash it.

417
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,849
Yay!

418
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,766
Fist bump.

419
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,894
Oh… yay.

420
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,604
Akane.

421
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,315
I'm making Naoki Fujitani mine tonight.

422
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,025
What?

423
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,902
Don't get in my way, okay?

424
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,945
See you.

425
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,530
Um, wait…

426
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,414
Huh?

427
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,541
He's not here.

428
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,336
He's not in his room either.

429
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,672
So much for our late-night rendezvous.

430
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,346
Huh?

431
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,167
Huh?

432
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,393
They're all my songs.

433
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:56,482
I know Naoki Fujitani
like the back of my hand.

434
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,934
I can't sleep.

435
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,477
Sensei.

436
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,648
Oh, it's you, Akane.

437
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,860
Did something happen?

438
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,866
I don't have the right
to feel hurt, right?

439
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,369
Huh?

440
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,830
Oh, right.

441
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,208
I found something interesting.

442
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,886
It's so cute!

443
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,556
Oh, that's a…

444
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,311
It's like Schroeder's piano. Cute, right?

445
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,688
Is it yours?

446
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,442
The mom I grew up with
was a piano teacher.

447
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,611
Oh, amazing.

448
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,531
Hitting C gives you an E flat.

449
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,846
I used to play this a lot
when I was a child.

450
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,749
<i>Dear God,</i>

451
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,627
<i>I have</i>

452
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,463
<i>someone I like.</i>

453
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,801
<i>Dear God,</i>

454
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,721
<i>I have</i>

455
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,391
<i>something precious to me.</i>

456
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,647
<i>Why can't that alone</i>

457
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,442
<i>be enough for this world?</i>

458
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,458
Today's "freshly made."

459
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,142
Sensei.

460
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,605
I…

461
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,358
I think that…

462
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:51,540
