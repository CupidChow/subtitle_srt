1
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,903
Ready?

2
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:29,988
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

3
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>Matrix, who am I?</i>
<i>I'll never be anyone</i>

4
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>I'm putting an end to my soliloquy</i>

5
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,097
<i>I'm taking sense and senselessness</i>
<i>To another level</i>

6
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,099
<i>My heart's beating out of my chest</i>

7
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,187
<i>Life is smoldering, life is growing dull</i>

8
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,690
<i>I pour the essence of my sobbing soul</i>

9
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>Into this endless stream of words</i>

10
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>Even in these tenuous times</i>

11
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>Where truth and lies are muddled</i>
<i>Everywhere you look</i>

12
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>You've gotta let your impulses burst free</i>

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>Since this was TENBLANK's</i>
<i>first nationwide tour,</i>

14
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,966
<i>I covered one of their shows.</i>

15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,846
<i>I never thought they'd be the kind of band</i>
<i>held together by scars and grit.</i>

16
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,725
<i>I thought they were the cool,</i>
<i>calculated types with a level head.</i>

17
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,605
<i>Our manager also used to call us</i>
<i>an intellectual band at first.</i>

18
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,441
<i>But now, he just calls me "stupid"</i>
<i>when he sees me.</i>

19
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,781
<i>What do you think about</i>
<i>the current TENBLANK?</i>

20
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,076
<i>Was it all part of the plan</i>
<i>or a miscalculation?</i>

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,495
It's what I'd hoped for.

22
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,414
<i>It'd be boring if it went as I expected.</i>

23
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,625
So in a way, my hopes are being fulfilled.

24
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,710
<i>- In other words…</i>
- You keeping up, Yokohama?!

25
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,005
<i>…you don't think about conserving</i>
<i>your energy on stage?</i>

26
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,965
What for?

27
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,428
That's impossible.

28
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>Stay here, 'cause nowhere is better</i>

29
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,435
<i>I overlooked the sounds</i>
<i>That meant the most</i>

30
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,441
<i>A rhythm that's ours alone</i>
<i>Is beating eternally</i>

31
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,362
<i>Like a concert, the beat never stops</i>

32
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,031
<i>Chasing blurry lines</i>

33
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,909
<i>You know you are beautiful</i>

34
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>Just us breaking all the rules</i>

35
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,417
<i>With you, there's no waste of time</i>

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,918
<i>You know</i>

37
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:55,008
<i>The reason we exist will never fade</i>

38
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,677
<i>It's right here, forever</i>

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,140
<i>Yeah, we're chasing blurry lines</i>

40
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,064
<i>I realized-wherever my happiness was</i>

41
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,026
<i>You were always standing by its side</i>

42
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,862
<i>And right by your tears</i>

43
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,073
<i>I vow to sing for the rest of my life</i>

44
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,286
<i>No matter how many millenniums it takes</i>

45
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,996
<i>I'll wait</i>

46
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,208
<i>There's no such thing as right or wrong</i>

47
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,960
<i>Nothing is impossible</i>

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>Listen, it's not about winning or losing</i>

49
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,634
<i>There's no such thing</i>
<i>As success or failure</i>

50
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,429
<i>Let's just be as we are</i>

51
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,723
<i>You and me</i>

52
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,559
<i>You are, you are beautiful</i>

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,729
<i>Chasing blurry lines</i>

54
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,691
<i>You are, you are beautiful</i>

55
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>Chasing blurry lines</i>

56
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,498
Encore!

57
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,544
TENBLANK!

58
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,690
<i>Hello?</i>

59
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,857
Yeah?

60
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,859
<i>Oh, there you are!</i>

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,569
<i>Hey, how's the tour?</i>

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,489
It's a struggle every day,
but it's super fun.

63
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,033
What about you?

64
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:45,952
<i>Hi there!</i>

65
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,662
<i>Hey!</i>

66
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,665
<i>There's something</i>
<i>we want to show you, Akane.</i>

67
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,582
Huh?

68
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,460
Wait for it…

69
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,212
- Ta-da!
<i>- Akane!</i>

70
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>Everyone came!</i>

71
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,844
<i>They say they are all fans of TENBLANK.</i>

72
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,056
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Thank you!</i>

73
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,560
I see…

74
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,104
So that's what you wanted to show me.

75
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,689
<i>Huh? What?</i>

76
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,940
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,567
You got a boyfriend, right?

78
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,114
He's Takahashi, a regular customer.

79
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,284
It's a shrine blessing.

80
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,370
- A shrine blessing?
<i>- Eiko wrote a prayer on an </i>ema.

81
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,788
That's right.

82
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,418
There's a place called Hikawa Shrine,
famous for making wishes come true.

83
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,003
Oh, I didn't know.

84
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,213
<i>You should go too, Akane. It's near there.</i>

85
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,214
It's nearby?

86
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,844
Why not invite Naoki and go with him?

87
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,803
<i>Why not?</i>

88
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,348
No, no. It's not like that with Sensei.

89
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,938
So? What else do you even wanna fix?

90
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,608
You know, the kind that makes you
wanna pass out? That.

91
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,693
Oh, the signature
Takaoka-brand guitar solo?

92
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,611
Thanks.

93
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,446
What are you doing?

94
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,282
Since we're going to all these places,

95
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,701
I wanted to check
the local food and specialties.

96
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,370
KAWAGOE HIKAWA SHRINE

97
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,413
What's Hikawa Shrine?

98
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,916
It's a tourist spot.

99
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,668
I see.

100
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,796
No, that's not it.

101
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,964
That sounds trashier. Not that.

102
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,132
What, then?

103
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,344
A freaking cool sound
you could die for please.

104
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,596
I've already played you
a ton of that earlier.

105
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,351
Man, you guys talk about
nothing but music.

106
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,020
That's because they have
nothing else to talk about.

107
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,440
What? Is that how you think of us,
Kazushi? How sad.

108
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,943
We talk about fun stuff too, right, Akane?

109
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,821
Yes. Right.

110
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,614
Like instruments and stuff.

111
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,117
Isn't that included in music?

112
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,703
Well, it's true. We haven't done much
together outside of music.

113
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,665
That's not great, right? We're so close.

114
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,376
Hey, let's spend Christmas together
as TENBLANK this year.

115
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,336
We could sing under a huge tree.

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,588
- So in the end, it's still music.
- I'll pass.

117
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,678
Christmas is for spending time
with someone you love.

118
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,180
Wait, Gen. There's someone you love
more than us?

119
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,183
I plan to find someone before Christmas.

120
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,436
But you're laughing.

121
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,604
- No, I'm serious.
- You're definitely lying.

122
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,772
- I'm serious.
- Really?

123
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,482
- Yeah.
- Hey.

124
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,193
Then why don't we go to a shrine together?

125
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,280
A friend told me there's one close here.

126
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,948
- Let's all go together.
- I'll pass.

127
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,658
At least consider it.

128
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,245
I have plans already.
I'm sorry, but Gen will go on my behalf.

129
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,998
I have a meeting too. Sorry.

130
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,167
Well, I guess

131
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,627
it'll just be the two of us, Akane.

132
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,714
Huh? The two of us?

133
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,769
Um, excuse me.

134
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,980
Are you Akane?

135
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,024
Oh, yes.

136
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,609
Oh my gosh!

137
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,445
I love your drumming so much!

138
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,280
I love TENBLANK!

139
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,451
I'm going to tomorrow's concert
no matter what. So good luck!

140
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,453
Thank you.

141
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,663
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,124
- Sorry to disturb you.
- No worries.

143
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,584
Thank you.

144
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,923
Akane.

145
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,674
Yes?

146
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,638
You'll be recognized right away like that.

147
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:36,766
Let's go.

148
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,313
You'll get recognized too, Sensei.

149
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,564
Where are we going?

150
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,360
Huh? What's wrong, Kazushi?

151
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,195
Nothing.

152
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,989
I mean, I just changed my mind.

153
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,369
Hey.

154
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,287
Is that Naoki's?

155
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,665
Yeah.

156
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,544
Huh? What?

157
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,505
Wait, these are prescription!

158
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,133
Huh? Wait, Kazushi!

159
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,636
Wait, what's with that face?

160
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,807
Look at that! It's so big!

161
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,727
Wow! The kimonos are so cute.

162
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,022
This looks delicious.

163
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,191
Why are you wearing my glasses, Naoki?

164
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,360
Glasses are amazing.

165
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,570
I can see so well.

166
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,198
What kind of shrine is it?

167
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,660
My friend said that if you write your wish
on an <i>ema </i>here,

168
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,245
it's supposed to come true.

169
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,746
Oh, those wooden plaques?

170
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,582
I've never written one.

171
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,333
Then let's write one today for sure.

172
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,504
By the way, what's your wish, Sensei?

173
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,218
Wow! It's so big!

174
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,875
KAWAGOE HIKAWA SHRINE

175
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:35,426
MAY THE TOUR BE SUPER DUPER SUCCESSFUL!
AKANE

176
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,794
What?

177
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:13,964
Nothing.

178
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,365
Okay.

179
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,617
Done?

180
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,618
What's with you?

181
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,537
- Why hide it?
- You don't need to see it.

182
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,081
- You wrote something weird, didn't you?
- I didn't.

183
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,126
FOR NAOKI TO PUT HIS MUG
IN ITS RIGHT PLACE

184
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,043
Huh?

185
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,421
These aren't wishes.

186
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,089
They're complaints.

187
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,720
Isn't it selfish to expect someone else
to grant your wish?

188
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,013
Sounds like you, Kazushi.

189
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,558
So, got any for me?

190
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,019
Too many.

191
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,564
Huh? What's with that?

192
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,233
Tell me!

193
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,318
Did I do something?

194
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,862
Think about it for yourself.

195
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,321
For myself?

196
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,324
Oh, when did you buy coffee, Sensei?

197
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,243
Wait, I'm not doing this right, am I?

198
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,580
I had to take the lid off first, right?

199
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,833
It's okay, Sensei.
You can pour the milk from the lid.

200
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,834
Really?

201
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,919
How can I do that?

202
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,506
Here, let me.

203
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,760
Okay.

204
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,595
There.

205
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,722
You're clever.

206
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,640
Here.

207
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,562
Is something wrong?

208
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,981
Nature calls.

209
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,760
MAY THE TOUR BE SUPER DUPER SUCCESSFUL!

210
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,179
MAY I STAY BY SENSEI'S SIDE FOREVER
AKANE

211
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,146
LOVE KNOT CHARM

212
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,111
Kazushi.

213
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,032
What?

214
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,245
Wait!

215
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,250
Well…

216
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,044
This is hard to say, but…

217
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,340
could it be that

218
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,217
you think of me…

219
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,057
as a rival?

220
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,976
What?

221
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,144
You like Sensei, right?

222
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,396
I can be really obtuse.

223
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,191
I'm sorry I didn't realize until now.

224
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,403
I even shamelessly and selfishly
consulted you about Sensei.

225
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,197
I'm really sorry.
I'm sure you didn't like that.

226
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,995
You're right.

227
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,955
You're so obtuse.

228
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,915
Sorry.

229
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,878
I thought you gave up on Naoki.

230
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,214
I don't think this love will be requited.

231
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,595
If you don't think so, then why?

232
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,765
Because I thought it wasn't meaningless.

233
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,143
Liking someone else does.

234
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,565
I don't need to lie to myself.

235
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,191
That's why

236
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,945
I want to cherish this feeling of love.

237
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,118
Why now after all this time?

238
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,250
Akane.

239
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
I'm sure that's a tabloid.

240
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,930
Let's go back.

241
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,264
Yeah.

242
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,489
Are we safe now?

243
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,702
Oh! Sensei! We need to get him!

244
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,459
<i>Every time I'm walking home alone</i>

245
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:07,591
<i>I crave a sound that moves my heart</i>

246
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,388
<i>I wanna forget those bad vibes from LINE</i>

247
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,100
<i>I tuck away my phone with a sigh</i>

248
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,687
<i>I don't like the way this familiar town</i>

249
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,565
<i>Looks right now, no</i>

250
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,360
Isanai<i>, invite me one more time</i>

251
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,406
<i>I won't forget again</i>

252
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:35,369
<i>That day I touched the light…</i>

253
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,412
I was worried

254
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,040
when I heard her latest track
was a total shift in style,

255
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,626
but it's crushing it on streaming.

256
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,212
Is that so?

257
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,258
If you can keep drawing out
her charm like this,

258
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,512
Yukino Sakurai is in safe hands with you,
Mr. Isagi.

259
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,244
Cut!

260
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,746
Okay.

261
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,205
We're taking a break.

262
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,167
Ms. Yukino, water--

263
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,378
I can't do this.
It has to be Naoki's songs.

264
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,465
Oh yeah?

265
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,216
That's a shame.

266
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,428
Naoki said he won't write
your songs anymore.

267
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:40,684
That's why I'm providing you
with new tracks.

268
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,228
Aren't you lucky?

269
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,694
You're as empty as I am.

270
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,907
You can't write a single song anymore.

271
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,910
What?

272
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,876
Naoki and I share the same soul.

273
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,713
That's why once he comes back,
it'll come flooding back.

274
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,841
The unstoppable sound of our genius.

275
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,429
TENBLANK is not Naoki's real sound.

276
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,224
He's also no good without me.

277
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,274
You're crazy.

278
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,261
It's been a while, Doctor.

279
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,709
I've been looking for you, you know?

280
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,670
Oh, it's Kazushi.

281
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,797
Where's Akane?

282
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,299
I had her go back.

283
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,349
What are you doing?

284
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,394
I feel like the last arrangement
could be better.

285
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,647
But if I described it in color,
it's not yellow.

286
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,733
Because that would
turn it into a sunflower.

287
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,905
What I want is something more like
a half-healed scab.

288
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,948
Wait, no.

289
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,368
I'm starting to lose it.

290
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,831
To sum up what you just said,
you haven't figured it out.

291
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,291
It's not that.

292
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,334
I'm hungry.

293
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,628
You know what?

294
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,060
If it were me,

295
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,355
I'd strip most of the core instrumentals,

296
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,440
bring the vocals forward,

297
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,567
and use a brighter tone,
like in <i>gagaku </i>music.

298
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,694
With a sort of "loud silence" vibe.

299
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,829
Ugh, Kazushi, I hate you.

300
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,251
How do you come up with things
I'd never think of?

301
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,129
I'm not you, so thinking the same way
would be impossible.

302
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,926
If you've got any complaints,
come up with another idea.

303
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,386
No complaints.

304
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,845
I'm just irritated.

305
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,309
Makes me want to trample all over it.

306
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,270
What?

307
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,397
Because it's beautiful.

308
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,443
Oh, so you're feeling bitter.

309
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,612
No.

310
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,572
I'm out of fuel.

311
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,300
Here.

312
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,478
Kazushi, you've grown
into a very caring person.

313
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,658
If it were you…

314
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,995
Let's see…

315
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,665
You would play it like this.

316
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,292
I got it.

317
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:21,173
I wonder why I love TENBLANK this much.

318
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,719
If we keep making sounds this good,
I might end up ruined, as a person.

319
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,304
Yeah, don't self-destruct.

320
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,556
You'll be fine, though.

321
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,022
Even you must have…

322
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,817
something more important to you
than music.

323
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,945
I hope so.

324
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,952
If you don't…

325
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,334
then can I have Akane?

326
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,441
<i>The doors will open in 20 minutes.</i>

327
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,193
We're finally here!

328
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,611
TENBLANK…

329
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,363
<i>Please wait a little longer.</i>

330
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:33,620
<i>The doors will open in 20 minutes.</i>
<i>Please wait…</i>

331
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,925
<i>Stay here--</i>

332
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,468
Sorry, hold on!

333
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,594
Stop for a sec.

334
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,221
Can I change guitars?

335
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,806
- No way! For who?
- For Midori.

336
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,308
What?! I don't like her.
She's like a vegetable.

337
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,936
Picky eaters won't grow big.

338
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,563
Taishi, pass me Midori…

339
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,522
Akane.

340
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,065
Yes?

341
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,900
Make sure to check the click track.

342
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,360
Okay.

343
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:11,992
Excuse me.

344
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,953
Did you have a fight or something?

345
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,247
- Not at all.
- No, of course not.

346
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,875
- From the top, then.
- Okay.

347
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,876
Please.

348
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,599
Take responsibility.

349
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,644
It's not fair.

350
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,356
You know that I can't sing without you!

351
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,862
Take responsibility and let me sing!

352
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,241
Don't get involved half-heartedly!
Take this more seriously!

353
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,160
Ms. Yukino.

354
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,913
- If it's not your songs--
- Let's discuss this another time.

355
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,915
He's right. It's embarrassing.

356
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,249
I don't care if it is.

357
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,587
But, you know… this is against the rules.

358
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,010
If you don't go now,
I'll never see you again.

359
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,560
Let's talk about work at work.

360
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,103
See you.

361
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,902
You call it work…

362
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,781
but for me…

363
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,202
it's my life.

364
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,457
It's the same for me too.

365
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,215
It's not.

366
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,812
It's okay.

367
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,188
Let's go.

368
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,745
Sorry.

369
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,082
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,631
I know I shouldn't be doing this.

371
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,844
It's the worst thing I could do.

372
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,721
And yet I'm making it worse.

373
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,183
I understand.

374
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,186
I get how you feel.

375
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,237
Thank you.

376
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,499
You know, Akane.

377
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,088
I still…

378
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,554
I still wish TENBLANK
would just fall apart.

379
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:21,931
Huh?

380
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,020
I love TENBLANK.

381
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,856
I also like you, Akane.

382
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,276
But I've come to hate it.

383
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,698
No.

384
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,993
It's not hate.

385
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,871
Even now, I still love it.

386
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,000
I cry when I hear TENBLANK's music.

387
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,841
But now, I resent it just as much.

388
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,308
That's why you shouldn't be kind to me.

389
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,397
If you're kind to me,

390
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,483
you'll come to regret it later, Akane.

391
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,654
After all, I…

392
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,200
I would do anything for Naoki's music.

393
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,872
I'd do whatever is needed
to make Naoki Fujitani mine.

394
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,375
I have that kind of determination.

395
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,506
You can't…

396
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,385
make someone yours…

397
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,388
with music.

398
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,145
It's not fair for you to say that, Akane.

399
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,122
Yes, hello?

400
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,669
Huh? What do you mean?

401
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,508
<i>We're sorry.</i>

402
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,807
<i>Today's show has been canceled.</i>

403
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,101
- We don't know.
- Who told you that?

404
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,312
It came from the higher-ups.

405
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,313
Gen!

406
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,026
What do you mean the venue got canceled?

407
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,945
What about the show?
Isn't the audience about to come in?

408
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,325
The venue is telling us to pack up
and won't change their minds.

409
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,368
And it's not just here.

410
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,787
- What?
- Huh?

411
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,831
All the remaining venues of the tour
also canceled us.

412
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,125
- All of them?
- But the tour has just started.

413
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,795
All the tickets sold out.
Why would they cancel?

414
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,922
They're all saying
we can't use their venues.

415
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,552
The organizers are swamped
with reimbursements. We're screwed.

416
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,262
No way…

417
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,936
There are so many people waiting for us.

418
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,400
Gen, can't we do anything?

419
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,985
Are we really packing up?

420
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:31,788
<i>We repeat, today's TENBLANK</i>
<i>ARENA TOUR ZERO Saitama show…</i>

421
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:42,090
TENBLANK'S NATIONAL ARENA TOUR ZERO
SUDDENLY CANCELED

422
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:04,404
TENBLANK'S NATIONAL TOUR
SUDDENLY CANCELED

423
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,839
You went too far, Ichidai.

424
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,262
Welcome home, Naoki.

425
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,778
NAOKI - TENBLANK

426
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,865
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME
SORRY FOR GETTING YOU INVOLVED

427
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,121
I'M GOING TO LIVE STREAM NOW, OKAY?

428
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,130
This is for us, right?

429
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,217
I'm so happy.

430
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,220
Akane.

431
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,651
Just for five seconds.

432
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,821
I'm making things harder for you.

433
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,414
I like you so much…

434
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,044
it's suffocating me.

435
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:31,035
