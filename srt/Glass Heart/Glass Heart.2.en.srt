1
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,363
Are you curious?

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,033
No way.

3
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,076
It just gets on my nerves.

4
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,174
Nice to meet you guys.

5
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,342
We're TENBLANK.

6
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,472
TENBLANK…

7
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,973
On drums,

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,558
Akane Saijo.

9
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,144
On bass and vocals,

10
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,439
Naoki Fujitani.

11
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,122
<i>Lifeless words never reach anyone's heart</i>

12
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,501
<i>I don't want to sing</i>
<i>Tainted by modern thought</i>

13
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,796
<i>Money, glory, status, and fame</i>
<i>They never made much sense to me</i>

14
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,925
<i>The answer I'm searching for</i>
<i>Isn't something so corrupt</i>

15
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,972
<i>MATRIX, who am I?</i>
<i>I'll never be anyone</i>

16
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>I'm putting an end to my soliloquy</i>

17
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,521
<i>I'm taking sense and senselessness</i>
<i>To another level</i>

18
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,773
<i>My heart's beating out of my chest</i>

19
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,777
<i>Life is smoldering, life is growing dull</i>

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>I pour the essence of my sobbing soul</i>

21
00:01:54,531 --> 00:02:00,078
<i>Into this endless stream of words</i>

22
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,165
<i>Even in these tenuous times</i>

23
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,669
<i>Where truth and lies are muddled</i>
<i>Everywhere you look</i>

24
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,422
<i>You've gotta let your impulses burst free</i>

25
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,896
I see. The drummer is the weak spot.

26
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,693
This isn't gonna cut it.

27
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,199
<i>Am I still dreaming?</i>

28
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>I'm sure I felt it</i>

29
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,997
<i>Is there even any point…</i>

30
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,750
She's not in her groove.

31
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>…in separating dreams from reality?</i>

32
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,546
<i>In a distant melody</i>

33
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,928
<i>Far beyond our comprehension…</i>

34
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,850
Akane.

35
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,147
Unleash yourself more. More!

36
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,442
<i>…the raindrops celebrate this life</i>

37
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,529
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

38
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,157
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,869
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

40
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

41
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,040
<i>The way you held your umbrella</i>

42
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,958
Now she's got it.

43
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,586
<i>Taught me everything about kindness</i>

44
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,756
<i>I hung my head and cried</i>

45
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>Afraid you'd see through my imitation</i>

46
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,682
<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>We were broken apart</i>

47
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,934
<i>A song was found in our love</i>

48
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,938
<i>The magic that brings back to life</i>

49
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,983
<i>The sad melody that lost its way</i>

50
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,780
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

51
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,073
So damn boring.

52
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,575
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

53
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,245
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

54
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,998
<i>The way your shoulders shook</i>

55
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,334
<i>Taught me everything about regret</i>

56
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,629
<i>I lost sight of what was right</i>

57
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>And in a daze, pulled you close</i>

58
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,557
Awesome!

59
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,853
What do you think of Naoki Fujitani?

60
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,855
Surprisingly good.

61
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,943
Yeah, he's so brilliant.

62
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,492
Are you gonna crush him?

63
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,662
No, I'll let him spread his wings.

64
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,290
For now.

65
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,463
He'll come back.

66
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,342
To me.

67
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,834
Good morning.

68
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,341
Whoa!

69
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,385
Oh sorry, my bad. You okay?

70
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,677
Yes, I'm fine.

71
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,762
Oh, good.

72
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,140
Kazushi!

73
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,977
Everyday life with Sho Takaoka in it.

74
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,065
I've got a bunch of stuff
I need to get used to soon.

75
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,320
- Huh?
- Use it.

76
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,448
Are you sure?

77
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,243
You need one from now on, right?

78
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,664
Thanks.

79
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,004
I was a bit too harsh the other day.

80
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,006
- What?
- Huh?

81
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,013
Rotation, localization, lodestone…

82
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,432
Lodestone!

83
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,766
Step into three beats…

84
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,893
now!

85
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,270
This locks it in.

86
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,565
Oh, but if that's the case…

87
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,526
Did he mention working on a song?

88
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,695
Beats me. Not that I recall.

89
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,574
It's like Sensei has three sides.

90
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,200
You might be right.

91
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,871
He's got a music mask, a filming mask,

92
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,206
and a human mask.

93
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,041
Human mask?

94
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,969
All right, so everyone…

95
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,722
What's with the "everyone"?

96
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,058
It took a while,
but the single release is officially set.

97
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,393
Wow.

98
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,563
This means no one can
complain about it now.

99
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,649
In other words,
there's no turning back for us either.

100
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,943
So let's do this, everyone.

101
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,781
Which means the recording
is in three days.

102
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,283
- What?
- What?

103
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,577
Hey, wait. This is way too sudden.

104
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,912
What about the actual song?

105
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,581
I thought I'd arrange the song
we performed at the Yaon.

106
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,917
Starting now? Will you make it in time?

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,126
I'll do my best!

108
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,712
Um, it might be fine for you,

109
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,840
but Akane's got school too, you know.

110
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,966
No, I'll be fine.

111
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,346
Oh yeah, it's your first time
recording with Sensei.

112
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,305
Huh?

113
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:42,980
Sorry.

114
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,441
School and all that.

115
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,737
Your life might change because of this.

116
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,202
- Oh my gosh!
- Let's listen to the next song too.

117
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,329
Definitely. It's gonna be on repeat.

118
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,541
Oh, it's Yukino Sakurai.

119
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,670
She's got a great voice.

120
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,298
Yes, and her songs are really good too.

121
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,718
Wasn't the producer Ichidai Isagi?

122
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,390
Sensei?

123
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,728
You'll be up there like her in no time.

124
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,940
Really?

125
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,786
No.

126
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,211
Hey, sorry.

127
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,338
Something's off.

128
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,263
<i>No, that's not it. Again.</i>

129
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,472
<i>Time's up, Naoki.</i>

130
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,641
<i>Ms. Saijo is at her limit too.</i>

131
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,984
I'm fine. I can still play!

132
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,695
Please tell me more.
What needs to be fixed, what's wrong.

133
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,613
- I'll--
- Okay, then.

134
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,365
Then bring me the Akane I know.

135
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,283
Right here.

136
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,378
Here.

137
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,422
Huh?

138
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,341
While I was at it.

139
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,635
Thanks.

140
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,603
What is the "me" that he's looking for?

141
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,443
You don't have to take
what he says so seriously.

142
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:59,617
His head is so full of his own music.
He's a terrible person otherwise.

143
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,288
Kazushi, do you not like Sensei?

144
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,958
It's not about liking him.

145
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,003
He's my enemy.

146
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,922
Enemy?

147
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,968
I've always made music on my own.

148
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,514
I compose using programmed tracks
and release them online.

149
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,934
I enjoyed doing it.

150
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,312
No unnecessary noise to worry about.

151
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,524
So a band really isn't for me.

152
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,736
But then, he invited me.

153
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:42,868
That means Sensei
appreciated your sound, right?

154
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,622
But that guy can do everything by himself.

155
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,334
He plays not just bass, but guitar too.

156
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,838
He might even be better than me
on keyboard.

157
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,719
So I don't get why he'd even form a band.

158
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,847
But

159
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,308
somehow I wanted to beat him.

160
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,478
I swore I'd beat him no matter what.

161
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,690
That's why I'm here.

162
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,695
So…

163
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,034
why not take him down too, Akane?

164
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,374
Are you trying to cheer me up?

165
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,376
What?

166
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,505
I mean, I was just saying
whatever I wanted about myself.

167
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,509
Kazushi, you're really kind.

168
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:47,391
Ugh, I really can't deal
with that dumb positivity of yours.

169
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,443
At this rate, we won't make it.

170
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,987
We need to go over the schedule again.

171
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,948
There you are, TENBLANK.

172
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,493
Yukino Sakurai.

173
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,494
So it really is you.

174
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,954
I saw you, TENBLANK.

175
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,760
A talented and good-looking guy?

176
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,472
It's so unfair. I love it.

177
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,812
I took her along to your gig at the Yaon.

178
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,899
A rare chance to witness history
in the making firsthand.

179
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,862
TENBLANK is about to completely shake up
the rock scene from the ground up.

180
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,616
It's been a while, Mr. Isagi.

181
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,995
What was your name again?

182
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,791
I'm Kai from BEAT Corporation.

183
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,585
I'm in charge of the production
and management for TENBLANK.

184
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,338
Just leave producing to him.

185
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,715
He knows how to handle it on his own.

186
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,509
Right?

187
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,262
Are you also recording
at this studio today?

188
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,471
Yeah.

189
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,723
We're working on Yukino's album.

190
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,394
But the title track isn't quite clicking.

191
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:20,568
So we thought featuring Naoki Fujitani
from TENBLANK would be a great idea.

192
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,737
I haven't heard anything about that.

193
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,905
Yeah.

194
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,907
That's because I haven't asked you yet.

195
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,205
But I'm sure you'll accept the offer.

196
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:45,467
I know Naoki Fujitani
like the back of my hand.

197
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,973
Excuse me, but we're out of time.

198
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,144
I'll be in touch again.

199
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,730
See ya.

200
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,112
You can't get involved with Isagi.
It'll happen again--

201
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,071
Miyako.

202
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,744
Thanks, as always.

203
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,038
I'll be fine.

204
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,550
- Do it again.
- Yes.

205
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,679
That's not it.

206
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,769
I don't want that sound.

207
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,479
Okay.

208
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,147
- Do it again.
- Yes.

209
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,738
- Again from the fill four bars ago.
- Okay.

210
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,192
Good morning.

211
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,860
Oh, morning.

212
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,697
You didn't go home?

213
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,281
So you came, huh?

214
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,770
Naoki!

215
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,789
Huh?

216
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,374
Did I wander off somewhere?

217
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,878
At least you managed
to stop short of Mars.

218
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,879
Sensei.

219
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,798
Let's stop with this already.

220
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,133
This isn't working.

221
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,846
Even if we keep the song as it is,

222
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,099
won't the sound naturally evolve
just by playing together?

223
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,687
You're thrown off because you're trying to
redo something that was already complete.

224
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,981
Why can't you understand
something so simple?

225
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,817
I don't want to.

226
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,652
What are you whining about?

227
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,947
If you fall apart now,
it'll all be for nothing!

228
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,158
But I don't want to sing it as it is!

229
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,625
If I can't be satisfied with it myself,

230
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,294
how could anyone else like it?

231
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,799
This TENBLANK song of ours…

232
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,011
Who's gonna love it?

233
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,393
There's just one thing

234
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,064
that I want you to understand, Sensei.

235
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,822
The longer you delay the work,
the more the fallout lands on us.

236
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,534
And yet…

237
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,373
the two young ones are working hard
without a single complaint.

238
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,041
They're even worried about you.

239
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:53,006
All those sentiments aside,

240
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,301
if you do truly believe
it's definitely worth doing,

241
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,098
then see it through with pride.

242
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,184
But…

243
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,398
even if you kept the song as is…

244
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,026
no one's gonna blame you.

245
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,618
I…

246
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,747
I want to sing it properly.

247
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,334
I know I can make it.

248
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,921
Please give me some time.

249
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,964
I'm sorry.

250
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,824
<i>I'm interested in your sound.</i>

251
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,458
This song is nice, Ichidai.

252
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,210
You think so?

253
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,586
Naoki!

254
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,670
Listen to me, Naoki!

255
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,382
I said to wait!

256
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,093
Sensei.

257
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,179
Sensei!

258
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,103
If you stay out here, you'll catch a cold.

259
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,483
Yeah, you're right.

260
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,529
Maybe it's because I met someone
I didn't want to.

261
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,866
Do you mean Mr. Isagi?

262
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,996
I'm the one who turned him into scum.

263
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,916
Huh?

264
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,711
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,715
I haven't been considerate enough
to everyone, huh?

266
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,177
I'm so sorry.

267
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,516
Um, I mean, I'm totally fine.

268
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,727
If anything, it's my fault
for being bad at drums.

269
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,315
And besides,

270
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,529
people struggling because of you…

271
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,406
It's almost routine at this point.

272
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,740
It's just the norm.

273
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,450
But

274
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,414
other people can't take on your struggles.

275
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,083
No one else can take your place.

276
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,045
Yeah.

277
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,892
I…

278
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,732
I've done a lot of terrible things
to others, and I'm aware of it.

279
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,027
But if there's one thing I'm sure of,

280
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,405
it's that despite all of that,
I'm still happy.

281
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,744
There are, of course, people who become
unhappy because of me.

282
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,707
Still, the music I create

283
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,420
can make at least the same number
of people happy, if not more.

284
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,050
So that makes it okay, right?

285
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,304
And, of course, I…

286
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,308
I'm going to make you happy too, Akane.

287
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,690
I promise I'll make you happy.

288
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,454
I heard Ichidai Isagi showed up.

289
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,581
Oh, yes.

290
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,793
It seems he was recording
at the same studio as us by chance.

291
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,961
By chance, huh?

292
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,174
I'd have preferred to keep him away.

293
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,844
I saw another side of him again.

294
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,804
Huh?

295
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:10,972
Naoki.

296
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,935
He may have many different sides,

297
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,312
but there's just one of him at his core.

298
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,737
You mean Sho Takaoka gave you a ride?

299
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,155
Yes, he did.

300
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,324
Why aren't you thrilled?

301
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,993
Are you really the Akane Saijo I know?

302
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:45,340
Even though Naoki said he was happy,
he looked lonely.

303
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,594
He was pushing himself to the edge.

304
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,808
One wrong step
could've made everything fall apart.

305
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,269
Well,

306
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,188
I guess he does give off
that kind of image.

307
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,192
Like he could just disappear
all of a sudden.

308
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,152
Stop it.

309
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,076
For the first time,
I felt scared of music.

310
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,580
In times like this,

311
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:23,128
all you can do
is keep playing the drums like crazy.

312
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,672
Hey, Miss Ambition.

313
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,717
Thank you for having us at the Yaon.

314
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,720
Yeah, that's right. You should thank us.

315
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,181
Is OVER CHROME also recording?

316
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,016
Hit them.

317
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,142
Hit them?

318
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,227
I said hit them!

319
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,218
Do you have a thing for Naoki?

320
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,178
Huh? Where did that come from?

321
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,180
You were playing just like Naoki,

322
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,141
so I thought you two
had done it at least once.

323
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,852
- What?! I just purely want to play--
- Purely?

324
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,896
You didn't forget all that tough talk,
right, Miss Ambition?

325
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,778
You picked a fight with us and forgot
your own sound? Give me a break.

326
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,448
My own sound…

327
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,908
<i>Then bring me the Akane I know.</i>

328
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,909
Right here.

329
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,954
That's why I warned you.

330
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,789
Getting close to Naoki

331
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,877
means you'll either destroy his sound
or destroy yourself.

332
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,674
Give up already.

333
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,511
I won't give up!

334
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,728
If you can keep up, then play.

335
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,607
But if you start sounding like Naoki,
I'll kill you.

336
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,156
Hey!

337
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,749
You suck!

338
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,404
Now you're offbeat.

339
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,535
I'm hungry. Buy me food.

340
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,622
Why should I?

341
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,045
Here's your ramen. Thanks for waiting.

342
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,380
- Thank you.
- Here.

343
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,758
- Thanks for the meal.
- Unbelievable.

344
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,261
What's the big deal? I'm paying for it--

345
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,139
Not putting onions in the ramen here
is blasphemy.

346
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,312
There.

347
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,485
Here we go.

348
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,659
It's so good!

349
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:09,122
Do you know why Naoki quit music once?

350
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,041
Huh?

351
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,836
Sensei quit music before?

352
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,508
Some guy he used to play with
stole his song.

353
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,474
But in the end, the one who stole it

354
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,311
had his own artistic sense
and musicality completely destroyed.

355
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,605
Serves him right.

356
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,238
The sound of a genius
makes ordinary people unhappy.

357
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,952
Ms. Kai said the same thing.

358
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,246
Don't put me on the same level
as that woman.

359
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,667
Well, well?

360
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,295
Huh?

361
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,922
Hey, where are you going?!

362
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,050
Hey, Genius.

363
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:04,928
Oh.

364
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,015
I guess coincidences do happen.

365
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,600
How interesting.

366
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,605
So, you're teaming up with Ichidai Isagi?

367
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,983
Where's your pride?

368
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,110
So you'll do anything just to sell?

369
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,781
I have my own vision
and just want to make it work.

370
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,201
Bypassing the agency and Miyako,

371
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,120
and now riding on Naoki Fujitani's
big connections.

372
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,997
What a joke.

373
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,460
No matter what I do,
my name will never be wiped clean.

374
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,381
Then I might as well get my hands dirty
and use every bit of it.

375
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,259
Look who's talking tough,

376
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,511
with that half-dead look on your face.

377
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,473
You think you're handling it,
but aren't you just wearing yourself down?

378
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,268
That's right.

379
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,854
Why not just go and die for real?

380
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,069
If your sound means that much to you,

381
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,699
just write as many masterpieces
as you can and then die already.

382
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,451
Then you'll definitely get to be

383
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,996
a "legendary genius."

384
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,668
Like John Lennon?

385
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,340
That's one way to do it.

386
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,856
Akane?

387
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,907
I have something to do,
so I'm heading home.

388
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,245
Sorry. I'm really sorry!

389
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,318
Akane!

390
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,071
Wait a second!

391
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,659
This…

392
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,162
Here.

393
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,957
Give this a listen.

394
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:44,337
I re-recorded the bass
and got Kazushi to program parts.

395
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,804
Akane?

396
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,226
I…

397
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,897
Should I not play your sound?

398
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,236
The way I'm playing now…

399
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,075
will I not be able to create
the sound you want?

400
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,042
Akane, let's say…

401
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,754
What if,

402
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,466
by some mistake, I died tomorrow…

403
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,511
and TENBLANK disappeared?

404
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,680
Huh?

405
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,268
Would you never play the drums again?

406
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,364
Sorry, it was just a hypothetical.

407
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,158
See you tomorrow.

408
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,315
<i>I guess he does give off</i>
<i>that kind of image.</i>

409
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,652
Like he could just disappear
all of a sudden.

410
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,823
- Akane.
- I'll play!

411
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,453
Even if you're gone
and TENBLANK disappears,

412
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,958
I'll find my own sound and play it!

413
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,423
But…

414
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,762
just don't disappear like John Lennon.

415
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,808
Yeah, we'll go with this.

416
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,161
I'm going now!

417
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,204
Have a good day.

418
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,253
NEW MESSAGE FROM NAOKI

419
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,339
FRESHLY MADE
"CRYSTALLINE ECHO.MP3"

420
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,499
<i>Am I still dreaming?</i>

421
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,669
<i>I'm sure I felt it</i>

422
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,838
<i>Is there even any point</i>

423
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:42,134
<i>In separating dreams from reality?</i>

424
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,553
<i>In a distant melody</i>

425
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:50,434
<i>Far beyond our comprehension</i>

426
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,312
<i>The raindrops celebrate this life</i>

427
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,275
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

428
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,819
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

429
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,823
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

430
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,950
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

431
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:09,120
<i>The way you held your umbrella</i>

432
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,415
<i>Taught me everything about kindness</i>

433
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,501
<i>I hung my head and cried</i>

434
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,213
<i>Afraid you'd see through my imitation</i>

435
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,680
<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>We were broken apart</i>

436
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,016
<i>A song was found in our love</i>

437
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,020
<i>The magic brings back to life</i>

438
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,397
<i>The sad melody that lost its way</i>

439
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,359
<i>No matter what else happens</i>

440
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,570
<i>The moon will be found by the sun</i>

441
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,699
<i>I could never bring myself to tell you</i>

442
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,951
<i>It's the same for you and me</i>

443
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,829
<i>The way your shoulders shook</i>

444
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,333
<i>Taught me everything about regret</i>

445
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,419
<i>I lost sight of what was right</i>

446
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,548
<i>And in a daze, pulled you close</i>

447
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,963
