1
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,120
This is the place I loved to visit

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,760
when I was upset,

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,880
when I had a problem with someone,

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,560
or when I wanted to sit alone to pass the time.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,200
Because this place made me feel peaceful.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,240
When they said "Nature Therapy",

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,120
I assume this is what they meant.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,760
But I didn't come here only to get away from my problems.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,240
Sometimes, I also came here because I felt at ease.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,880
My name is Guy, I'm a Social Sciences student.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,880
But I'm not very good at socializing.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,950
Because I haven't talked to people that much,

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,519
nobody wants to talk to me.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,920
When I'm focusing on something,

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,480
Everyone around doesn't really matter to me.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,440
But one day, fate made me,

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,200
the one who always stared at the whiteboard...

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,039
Can I borrow your lecture? I couldn't keep up.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,480
...finally look sideways.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,160
I recently moved here,

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,080
so I had a hard time following the studies.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Sure thing.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,240
Is the seat next to you already taken?

25
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,060
Then I'll sit here.

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,759
I forgot to introduce myself.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm Wahl.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,840
Not as in "ask for help",

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
but as in "Whales", the mammal.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,680
Here, they act like this.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,880
That's a seal.

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Really?

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
That's not it?

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Wahl.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
A man who's both charming and cheerful.

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,320
He's the type of person

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,039
that can make anyone in his life

38
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,920
fall in love with him..

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
easily.

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,240
Wahl's always thoughtful.

41
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,250
Is that all you've brought?

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
He's the person who always see me.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
I'll be right back.

44
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,360
Here, let me help.

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,040
But it's not only me that he can see.

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,000
Isn't that heavy?

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And sometimes

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
I think to myself that

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,079
He should be my one and only friend.

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm a kind of person who has few friends.

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,290
If he's gone,

52
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,160
I probably won't have anyone to be with.

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,400
What are you doing?

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Acting in a music video?

55
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,740
I'm not.

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,370
Hey, If there's something wrong

57
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,680
you can tell me.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,490
I'm fine, really.

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,010
I just...

60
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,320
want to be alone.

61
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,820
But I wanna be with you today.

62
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,240
I noticed you weren't looking well today,

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
So I came to keep you company.

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Why are you here anyway,

65
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
no one dragging you somewhere today?

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,520
If I had to choose between you and those people,

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,120
I'd choose to be with you.

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,100
You'll always be my first choice.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,000
Shit, the first choice.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,040
I'm the A in the exam's choice,

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,240
the first popsicle to be picked from the fridge,

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,880
the T-shirt on the top.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,100
Guy.

74
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,510
I got accepted.

75
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,400
- Really?
- Yeah, I got accepted!

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,720
What about you?

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,120
Are you in, find it yet?

78
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,450
Until I followed Wahl to study in a faculty

79
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,440
in which I had no interest in.

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,870
And today

81
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,790
is his birthday,

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,720
I've prepared

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
to tell him about my feelings for him

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,550
so that he'll finally know.

85
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Hello.

86
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
What's up.

87
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,960
Hello, where are you?

88
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm in front of the theatre.

89
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,020
Oh, you're there?

90
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,450
What about you?

91
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,330
I've arrived, just a moment.

92
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,810
See you in the next ten seconds.

93
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Ten..

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,880
Nine.. Eight.. Seven...

95
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Six.. Five.. Four..

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,920
Three.. Two.. One..

97
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,320
I want to introduce you to someone.

98
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,880
This is Guy.

99
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,570
Hi, Guy.

100
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,130
That's Nami.

101
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,800
Humanities, English Major student.

102
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
She's in the same year as we are.

103
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Hey.

104
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,840
I had no idea Wahl was in a relationship with a woman.

105
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,560
Are you sure he's your friend?

106
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,880
He didn't say what she was to me.

107
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,420
You don't know, huh?

108
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,060
- But I guess anyone could tell.
- Stop, your friend will be embarrassed.

109
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,280
Okay, I'll stop teasing.

110
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,840
Let's go for a walk.

111
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
Hey, let's go.

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,240
My feelings toward Wahl,

113
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,159
will no longer be the same from now on.

114
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Amazing, right?

115
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Wahl.

116
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
What?

117
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Wahl.

118
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,920
Happy birthday, and...

119
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,320
This is my birthday present to you.

120
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,440
[Alright, Let's be a couple.]

121
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,640
Thank you so much.

122
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,200
Hey, Guy.

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
Will you take a picture for us?

124
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
You done?

125
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Thank you.

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm so happy.

127
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
You like it?

128
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,320
In the end...in his birthday,

129
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,800
My attempt to confess my feelings had failed.

130
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,880
I'll never get another chance to tell him.

131
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
I love you.

132
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,840
Hey!

133
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,150
After that,

134
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,440
My life was once again empty.

135
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,470
I have no desire to speak with other real human beings.

136
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,400
Maybe there's no place for me on this planet.

137
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,000
My life after this...

138
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,200
may belong in...

139
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,760
the online world.

140
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,840
In this place,

141
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
I have many friends.

142
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,880
We have a lot of things in common.

143
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,200
We fight together side by side

144
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,110
everynight, as a daily activity.

145
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
That was close.

146
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,400
I would've been destroyed if it hadn't been for Yuri's help.

147
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,000
Tua-Tung and friends

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
would be as dead as a doornail.

149
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,520
Goddamn,

150
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,120
The last match was epic!

151
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Epic? Our tanker was always the first to hide.

152
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Hey, How?

153
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,880
You wanted me to stand still?

154
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Noob.

155
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
If I didn't help,

156
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Assassins like you

157
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,280
would die countless times.

158
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,280
Chicken.

159
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,720
Chicken? Beat you in the game and in real life!

160
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
Relax, bro.

161
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,920
P.Insomnia's a lady.

162
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,280
Don't you know?

163
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,660
That I'm good with kids,

164
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,920
old people,

165
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,760
and women!

166
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,960
Come, I'm not afraid of you.

167
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Gender equality exists now, men and women are equal.

168
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,960
You're on, P.Insomnia!

169
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,720
When and where, make and appointment!

170
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,160
Stop fighting already,

171
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
or Tua-Tung will start crying.

172
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,400
There there, don't cry.

173
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
One more round?

174
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,080
Sure sister, come on.

175
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Let's go!

176
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
I'm ready.

177
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
What about Yuri?

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,040
[I'm busy now]

179
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm busy now

180
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,920
Done for today, Yuri?

181
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
[Yes]

182
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,200
Well, that was a blunt answer.

183
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,870
Yuri's acting so mysterious.

184
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,380
Everyone else turns on their microphones and yells,

185
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,400
but this one only listens.

186
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,840
Maybe she was afraid you'd offend her,

187
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,040
so she didn't turn on her microphone.

188
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,760
I'm about to offend you, Dr.strange!

189
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,780
I think we should hang-out sometimes.

190
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,840
We talk without seeing one other for quite a while.

191
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,740
Good idea.

192
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,040
Tua-Tung wish to meet everyone!

193
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,370
Are you free, Idealize? Let's meet up.

194
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,750
Sure, bro.

195
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,520
What about Yuri?

196
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,560
You invite her.

197
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,160
Why does it have to be me?

198
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,620
Because you are the closest to her.

199
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,290
Just figure out a way to invite,

200
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm counting on you.

201
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,000
And about the meeting,

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,320
Anyway, let me know when you guys're free in the DM.

203
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,600
Then I'll inform you in the next session.

204
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm going to bed for real now, so sleepy.

205
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,670
Bye.

206
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,530
Don't forget Idealize,

207
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,280
make sure you can invite her.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,370
[They're going to set up a meeting..]

209
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,940
[..and make me invite you, wanna come?]

210
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,380
Regardless of how close we are in the game,

211
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,320
I sometimes feel like Yuri has a lot of personal space.

212
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,760
Honestly,

213
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,380
I have no actual idea what kind of woman Yuri is.

214
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,870
Yuri!

215
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,840
What's up, sister.

216
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,660
Are you going to work?

217
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,120
Customers in the VIP room are waiting for you.

218
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,820
Do nothing but play video games all day.

219
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,570
[I want you to meet us.]

220
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,120
Yuri's here, mister.

221
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,760
There you are, my Yuri.

222
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,520
Hello.

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
Hello, mister.

224
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Appreciated, Mamasan.

225
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,400
Take your time.

226
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,320
How refreshing.

227
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,800
Very refreshing.

228
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,160
You know something, Yuri?

229
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,030
Drinking liquor is bad.

230
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,960
It's harmful for the health.

231
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,690
I don't wanna drink them anymore.

232
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,680
Then would you like some soda

233
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,120
or some cola instead?

234
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,240
I want some milk.

235
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Huh?

236
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,940
Have you heard?

237
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,440
Liquor's bitter,

238
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,170
Milk's better.

239
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,240
Wait.

240
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,460
Unfortunately, we don't sell milk at our bar.

241
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,700
But if you want some,

242
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,380
I'll go out and get some for you.

243
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,569
Hey.

244
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,200
Don't act like you don't get it.

245
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,080
Please don't.

246
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,330
Help!

247
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Hey, you!

248
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,770
Help me!

249
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,180
Stop it right now.

250
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Tew.

251
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,640
They're going to molest me.

252
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,850
Who the hell are you.

253
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,850
Stay out of this.

254
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,560
Excuse me, Sir.

255
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,390
I'm the manager of this bar.

256
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,280
I heard all the loud noises,

257
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
so I have to come in and check.

258
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,050
The manager?

259
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,960
Will you instruct your girl?

260
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,640
I paid her to entertain, but she refused to do it.

261
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,720
He touched my breasts.

262
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,250
Go wait outside,

263
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,520
I'll handle it from here.

264
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,060
Please calm down, sir.

265
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,400
Our employees duties

266
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,520
are only to entertain,

267
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,240
mix drinks and chat for amusement.

268
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,480
They are unable to fulfill your request.

269
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,720
Therefore,

270
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,900
We'd suggest you leave the bar now.

271
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,800
You dare kicking the customers out?

272
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,440
I've paid for the service!

273
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,630
Our bar

274
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,280
has surveillance cameras.

275
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,610
You can check to see that

276
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,740
you were harassing our employee.

277
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,660
Let's keep the police out of this situation.

278
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,690
This way, please.

279
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,250
Come on, Yuri.

280
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,300
Took you a long time to respond.

281
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,230
[Are you going?]

282
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,840
[If you go, I'll go too.]

283
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,680
[So, which day, exactly?]

284
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,480
[Not sure about the date, but everyone's coming.]

285
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,140
Hello

286
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,520
Okay, I'll wait there as well.

287
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,090
Thank you for coming to help.

288
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,940
I'm going to request a leave,

289
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,640
but I'll tell you which day later.

290
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,990
Get home safe.

291
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,710
Goodnight.

292
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Or is it because everyone's going to be there

293
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,280
so Yuri doesn't want to go?

294
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,830
[Responding slowly like this, you don't wanna go?]

295
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,880
There's no camera around here.

296
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,980
You're gonna die today.

297
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,020
Still not finished, Mr.customer?

298
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,620
[No.]

299
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,600
[I thought you were uncomfortable..]

300
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
[..since you knew everyone was coming.]

301
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,570
[It wasn't like that,..]

302
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,630
[..I can go if you come with me.]

303
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,630
[I'll definitely go if you go.]

304
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,330
[I was concerned at first that you could dislike meeting people.]

305
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,750
[Because I also don't like to be around many people too.]

306
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,090
[Why?]

307
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,420
[I have low self-esteem and am not good at talking to others,..]

308
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,760
[..worried they may be annoyed at me.]

309
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,860
[I'm also not good at talking to people who aren't close to me.]

310
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,750
Alright,

311
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,440
let's try this out.

312
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,810
[Should we meet up beforehand?..]

313
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,360
[..So that we may get to know each other first..]

314
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,950
[..That way when you have to meet the others, you won't be shy.]

315
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,710
Hey!

316
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,560
[It's alright if you don't want to.]

317
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,340
[I'd like to, let's meet up first..]

318
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,250
[..Anywhere is up to you.]

319
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,060
Tul.

320
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,280
Come take care of things behind the bar for me.

321
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,360
Come on, focus.

322
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,490
[What're you up to?]

323
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,780
[Getting dressed.]

324
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,480
[I just finished getting dressed too..]

325
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,760
[..I'll send you a picture of my outfits.]

326
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,770
[What are you wearing? You can tell me..]

327
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,090
[..So that I can look for you.]

328
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,230
[When we meet, you'll find out.]

329
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,310
Hiding something?

330
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,580
Yuri.

331
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,180
Oh...Wahl.

332
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,000
Where are you going?

333
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,010
Do you need anything?

334
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,600
Uncle Dum restaurant's back on the business.

335
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,930
Oh!

336
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,510
Crispy century eggs with basils?

337
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,720
That's right!

338
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,120
Your favourite.

339
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,760
He's back in the kitchen now.

340
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,480
I heard it had been closed for a long time.

341
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,720
Really?

342
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,850
I came to meet you as soon as I found out.

343
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,520
Wanna go out for a meal together?

344
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,860
Come on, let's go eat!

345
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,680
I really don't understand...

346
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,510
Why can't I ever say no to Wahl?

347
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,070
Very much miss crispy century eggs with basils.

348
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,470
Your preferred recipe.

349
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,640
Two more fried-eggs, Dad.

350
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,940
Your order.

351
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,630
Thank you, Ink.

352
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Thanks.

353
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
See how it tastes.

354
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,110
How's that?

355
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,630
Same as usual.

356
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,720
Everything's the same, man!

357
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,530
I've figured out you'll like it.

358
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,640
I requested extra crispy basils for you.

359
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,440
There, go ahead and eat.

360
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,460
I'll scoop them for you.

361
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,360
What? Eat up!

362
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,040
Why do you keep staring?

363
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,860
You can eat now.

364
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
So...

365
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,790
How did you know he's back on the business?

366
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,140
Nami stumbled onto this place.

367
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,840
But she didn't know

368
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,040
that we used to come and eat here.

369
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,800
She noticed the food looked tasty,

370
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,240
so she invited me here.

371
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,600
I thought this place was permanently closed.

372
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,980
haven't seen it open for a long time.

373
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,150
Oh!

374
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,520
And Nami loves the same menu as you.

375
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
Zoned out?

376
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,960
What's wrong with you?

377
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Well, you zoned out.

378
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,360
What?

379
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,080
[Where are you now? I'm already here.]

380
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,010
[I'm heading out, please wait for me.]

381
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Hey, dude.

382
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,680
Wanna go get something sweet next?

383
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,940
There's a new place opening near the front of the university

384
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Actually,

385
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,600
I have somewhere that I need to go.

386
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
I have an appointment.

387
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
An appointment?

388
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,320
Who are you going to meet?

389
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,300
Jeng's group?

390
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,280
Or Kaew's?

391
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:19,970
Not them.

392
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,680
You woudn't know.

393
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
How could I not know?

394
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,000
All of your friends are also one of mine.

395
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,620
Everything he said was right.

396
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,100
All of his friends

397
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,040
are also my friends.

398
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,510
And now...

399
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,970
I wish to finally have my own world.

400
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,200
Not everyone.

401
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,800
This one is my friend.

402
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
And I'm going to meet her for the first time.

403
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,800
Am I late?

404
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
I'm late.

405
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Hey, Guy!

406
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,120
Guy, wait!

407
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,340
[If you don't arrive here within five minutes,..]

408
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,680
[..I won't wait anymore.]

409
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,340
[Heading there as fast as I can..]

410
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,210
[..I'm so sorry.]

411
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
[I've arrived,..]

412
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,040
[..Has it been more than five minutes?]

413
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,480
[I'm sorry, please don't be mad.]

414
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,890
[Are you still there? I'm standing at the entrance.]

415
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,120
Idealize, right?

416
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yuri.

417
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm not who you think I am, right?

418
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,880
Well...

419
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,790
Not exactly what I imagined.

420
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,800
But that's fine.

421
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,300
If you could actually heal people

422
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,560
or wear a costume like in the game,

423
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,840
then I would be more surprised.

424
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,920
By the way...

425
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,520
I guess I'm not like in the game too.

426
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,910
The real me isn't that good at conversations.

427
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,430
My name is Tew.

428
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,480
Okay.

429
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,460
What's your name?

430
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,910
Or you prefered to be called Idealize?

431
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,840
My name's Guy.

432
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,040
Let us go inside.

433
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,080
I've already bought the tickets.

434
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,280
Oh!

435
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I...

436
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,750
already have an annual ticket.

437
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,340
That's why I picked this place.

438
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,140
Let's go inside.

439
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,000
Everything has gone wrong.

440
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,160
I arrived late,

441
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,800
made horrible jokes,

442
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,680
and he had to lose money on the ticket purchase.

443
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,000
If he's upset and speaks in a harsh tone,

444
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,760
then that wouldn't be strange.

445
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,960
In the game,

446
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,090
He wasn't much of a talker to begin with.

447
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,790
Meeting him in person,

448
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,390
he's even more silent.

449
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,490
Do I always have to speak first?

450
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,250
So...

451
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,530
Why did you play as a female character?

452
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,260
I watched my junior playing, and the game looked fun.

453
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,200
So I asked her to create an ID for me.

454
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,090
But she said she wanted to create a new one.

455
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,400
That's why she gave me her previous ID.

456
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,850
Is he not interested in hearing any of my story?

457
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,830
Or am I the only one that has to start a conversation?

458
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,280
I like to look at the jellyfishes too.

459
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,860
Do you know...

460
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,350
that they are magnificent creatures?

461
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,430
They can live without a brain

462
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,840
and a heart.

463
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Is that so?

464
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,280
I've mentally prepared myself

465
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,040
that he will not be like in the game.

466
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,020
But I wasn't expecting him

467
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,920
to be so different.

468
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm not as scary as you think, Guy.

469
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,400
I'm not scared of you.

470
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,620
I'm just...

471
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,710
nervous because this is the first time we've met.

472
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,139
Tew.

473
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,550
Can I ask you something?

474
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,080
What happended to your hand.

475
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,000
Don't worry that I'll be afraid of you.

476
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,680
You can tell me.

477
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,440
I'd rather not meet anyone else.

478
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,250
I'm not like who I was in the game.

479
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm worried I'll frighten the others

480
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,570
and make things unenjoyable.

481
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,410
Tew...

482
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,750
Why would you think that?

483
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,280
Please go with me.

484
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,960
What do I have to do to make you go.

485
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,450
You can make me do anything.

486
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,040
I'll do it.

487
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,260
Why do you want me to go so much?

488
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,920
I don't have a lot of friends.

489
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,220
When they were planning the offline meeting,

490
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,760
everyone expected me to be able to invite you.

491
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,920
I don't want everyone to be disappointed with me.

492
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,620
I don't want them to look at me like

493
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,360
I'm a useless person.

494
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,260
Please come with me.

495
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Please.

496
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,220
I'm hungry,

497
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,520
Let's go find something to eat.

498
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,600
Hey, you.

499
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,790
So, are you going or not?

500
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,960
Answer me first.

501
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm hungry,

502
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,340
going to get something to eat.

503
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,960
Are you coming with me, Guy?

504
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,050
Mean, quiet, and self-centered.

505
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,660
I'm probably going to let everyone down.

506
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,310
Wow, looks delicious.

507
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,640
Do you want to have this one?

508
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,280
Whatever you want.

509
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
He's the one who want to eat,

510
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,840
then said "whatever I want"?

511
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,530
If you want to eat anything, you can pick it up.

512
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,070
It's all yours.

513
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,520
How about an icebreaker drink,

514
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,440
It may encourage him to speak more.

515
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,520
Miss!

516
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
One bottle of soju, please.

517
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Give us two bottles.

518
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,160
You're a drinker?

519
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,120
Yes, I drink.

520
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,320
I'm not that young, you know?

521
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
Or maybe you don't want to drink?

522
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,040
I have no problem with that.

523
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,600
You've already poured for me.

524
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,960
I'll pour for you as well.

525
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,760
This Soju is strong,

526
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
can you handle it?

527
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,520
Sure, I can.

528
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Easy-peacy!

529
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Can I have some?

530
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,140
You.

531
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,760
You've filled your glass, now fill mine too!

532
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,800
I'm still good.

533
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,500
when someone insists they're still good,

534
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,760
means they are not.

535
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,960
Fine, If you don't pour, I won't drink.

536
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,160
Whatever.

537
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,440
I really gotta ask.

538
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,190
Why did you choose to play as an adorable character in the game?

539
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,960
Being a support class.

540
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,960
Nothing like the real you at all.

541
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,080
I crossed the line,

542
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,240
Sorry.

543
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,800
Few players chose to play as a support.

544
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,630
So playing one would make it easier for me to make new friends.

545
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,520
You wanted to have friends, just like me.

546
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,560
In that case, we're now pals!

547
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,060
We are friends now,

548
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,440
don't stare at me.

549
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,290
Come, come.

550
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,010
I'll pour the drink for you.

551
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,240
It's empty already?

552
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,610
You know?

553
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,390
The first moment I met you

554
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,800
I was terrified of you.

555
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,000
What kind of person

556
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,040
could make such a straight face?

557
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,000
Were you even scared?

558
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,730
You only said one sentence in response.

559
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,880
What were you thinking in that head of yours.

560
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,280
Nonetheless,

561
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,830
at least now you're not the same.

562
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,480
Aren't you the one

563
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,000
who isn't the same?

564
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,800
What?

565
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,360
It's you who's being different.

566
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,600
Do you realize that you've been speaking more than earlier?

567
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Well, since you...

568
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,680
talk a lot.

569
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,720
I'll also talk more with you too.

570
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
Do you know that

571
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:41,040
this is the day I spoke the most in my whole life?

572
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,840
Not sure if it's because of the soju...

573
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,970
or because of you.

574
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Guy?
