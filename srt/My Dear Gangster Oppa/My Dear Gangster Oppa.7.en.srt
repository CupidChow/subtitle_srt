1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,020
How did you get here?

2
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,980
I just thought you'd be here.

3
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,360
You've been standing here for so long,

4
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,460
Why didn't you call me?

5
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm giving you time to be with yourself

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,780
until you're ready to step out of there.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,200
It's okay, buddy.

8
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,550
I'm right here.

9
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,050
(It is too hard...)

10
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,120
(Please tell me...)

11
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,570
(What to do?)

12
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,660
I've already told you, right?

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,770
I'll always be there for you no matter what

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,910
and will never abandon you.

15
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,160
I might have to let Tew go

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,720
and go back to living my same life.

17
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,620
(As when our eyes meet every time,)

18
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,280
(I have seen you and myself in there)

19
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:35,079
(As when your smile captured my heart,)

20
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:40,760
(From the day that we first met. I’ve falling for you)

21
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,060
(Your smile has healed and calm the heart,)

22
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,920
(From things that crashing down the heart)

23
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,960
(The answer that my heart will only need,)

24
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,060
(It is you. Only you and always you)

25
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,860
(Could not trade for the world)

26
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,090
(With the best thing I have cherish right now)

27
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,970
(And it is you)

28
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,520
(Have never seen no one)

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,870
(That’s the best thing that came across me and my heart)

30
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,390
(What should we call it...)

31
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,890
(The place where it’s only ours)

32
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,950
(The place where it’s you and me)

33
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,280
(From now and ever)

34
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,470
(The place where we leave our tears and wounds)

35
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,390
(Cause it is our area)

36
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,880
(And I)

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,650
Hey.

38
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,330
Are you feeling better now?

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,360
I've just broken up with my boyfriend.

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,310
How can I recover that fast?

41
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,020
Then let’s celebrate.

42
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,300
I've also become single today, just like you.

43
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,790
What do you mean?

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Well...

45
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,040
Nami ended our relationship.

46
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
Ouch?

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
Why?

48
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,830
What happened?

49
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,080
Today’s her birthday,

50
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,780
and I completely forgot about it.

51
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,159
Maybe she was just mad at you.

52
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
I don’t think so.

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
I guess...

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,280
today’s incident was more like the last straw.

55
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,480
Between me and her,

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,360
things haven’t been good for a while.

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
But that was all my fault.

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,520
What was it about?

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,030
Tell me about it now.

60
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,720
Well, She said...

61
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,960
I've been ignoring her,

62
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,000
didn’t care for her like before,

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,150
and everything I've been interested in was you.

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,390
Maybe what she said was right.

65
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,100
You were on my mind.

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,080
Your face never leaves my thoughts.

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,270
Come on.

68
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,790
What?

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,280
Isn’t it good that I care about you?

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
We're about to come back and become best friends,

71
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
Best buddies, just like the same.

72
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,720
Ew,

73
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,520
Gross.

74
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
What the heck?

75
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,320
Your face looks like you're going to throw up.

76
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,400
What? I wasn’t going to throw up or anything.

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
You did.

78
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,720
I just saw it

79
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Your face was like this.

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Wahl!

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,050
But you really did that.

82
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,270
You’re unbelievable

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,040
Whatever.

84
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,440
Come, let’s have a toast.

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,480
To our friendship, my dear friend.

86
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Dear friend.

87
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
Alright, we’re here.

88
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,190
Take off your shoes first.

89
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,040
Hey, don’t go to bed yet.

90
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,640
- Go take a shower first.
- So sleepy.

91
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
Wahl!

92
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,920
Get up.

93
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,159
Get up.

94
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,200
I’m going to sleep now.

95
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,600
It stinks everywhere, Wahl.

96
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,830
Guy.

97
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,240
Do you realize how cute you are?

98
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,760
What’s with you?

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
I mean it.

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,720
You’ve always been adorable,

101
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,840
and I was the one who wasn’t brave enough

102
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,470
to admit how I felt about you.

103
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,920
My name’s Wahl.

104
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,080
From the first time I saw you,

105
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,480
you stood out from everybody else,

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,200
Drawing me towards you.

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,280
I couldn't help but stare at you.

108
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,560
Glad to have you beside me.

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
What,

110
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
You broke up again?

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,159
It haven't even been two months with this one yet.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,960
I don’t see any problem.

113
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,480
Breakups are fine.

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,679
I'd rather come back to you.

115
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,720
Every time you break up with your girl,

116
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,790
you always come back to me.

117
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Like every single time.

118
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,790
Sometimes, a thought came to my mind

119
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,400
that if I could date you,

120
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,230
then it would be great.

121
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,620
But I could only tell myself that you're my friend.

122
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
My closest friend.

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,760
But my heart...

124
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,360
was at a loss for how to feel about you.

125
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,960
I want to be with you.

126
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,200
I don't want to lose you to someone else.

127
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,430
Do you understand that?

128
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,080
Wahl.

129
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,600
What the hell are you doing?

130
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
I like you.

131
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,160
Hey.

132
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
Goodbye, Guy.

133
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,390
(Tew)

134
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,750
I had to do it.

135
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,860
You've challenged me yourself.

136
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,150
Don't make such a shocked face.

137
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,960
Are you going to kill me?

138
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,720
Otherwise, you wouldn't have woken me up, right?

139
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
You know

140
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,920
I'd never snuck up on anyone.

141
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,200
I want you to know

142
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,240
that I'm the one who's taking your life.

143
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,920
Why did you do this to me?

144
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,040
Even though I saved your life.

145
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
Don't you know anything at all?

146
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Haven’t you known

147
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,800
How long I had to put up with other people's abuse?

148
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,640
Have you never known anything?

149
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,920
I’ve already told you.

150
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,440
Go and collect all of the money...

151
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
in full.

152
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Yes, Boss.

153
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
Can you stop being fucking nosy for once?

154
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,280
I believe that if we can seize that area,

155
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,320
Then we’ll be able to expand our territory.

156
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,320
Learn to be more like Tew.

157
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
I had to deal with people pushing me around for a long time,

158
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,080
but you get to enjoy being loved?

159
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,760
Do you know how much suffering I've had

160
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,800
since my life ended up this way?

161
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,440
If you have a grudge against me,

162
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,920
You take it out on me.

163
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,160
Why did it to others?

164
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,640
I’ve already done it!

165
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,340
Letting you die a quick death is too simple.

166
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,920
How many times did you have to die?

167
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
How many times have you had a new life?

168
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,920
All of that resulted from my decision.

169
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,360
Haven't you ever been grateful for that, huh?

170
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,590
Are you really going to kill me?

171
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,840
You sure you can do it?

172
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,030
Enough!

173
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Tew, stop!

174
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,240
I want to end all of this.

175
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,280
I just want to leave my old life behind.

176
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,560
But if you won't leave me alone,

177
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,240
then I can't let you live any longer.

178
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm done, Tew.

179
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,000
Please spare me.

180
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,560
I'm done.

181
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,200
I won’t bother you again.

182
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I won’t mess with your loved ones.

183
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,880
Tew, I'm sorry.

184
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,040
Sorry.

185
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Please spare me.

186
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,080
Please spare my life

187
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm finished.

188
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,160
Tew.

189
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I’m done

190
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,700
I’m really finished.

191
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,760
This is the last time.

192
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,680
I hope this shit finally comes to an end.

193
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,040
Show me your face again

194
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
and you’re dead.

195
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,600
I'll stop...

196
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,000
because I have bigger problems than getting revenge.

197
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Tew.

198
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Guy.

199
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,310
I was wondering where you were.

200
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,670
I couldn’t sleep.

201
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Why couldn’t you sleep?

202
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,280
Was it because of what I said last night?

203
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,640
I was very drunk,

204
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
so there isn't much I remember.

205
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,640
You said...

206
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
You like me...

207
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,290
and always want to be by my side.

208
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
Don't you remember?

209
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,600
If you don't know what to answer,

210
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,560
I get it.

211
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,920
You were drunk,

212
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,640
so it was normal to rant.

213
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,670
Go take a shower,

214
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,080
I’ll go get you something to eat.

215
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,350
Guy.

216
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Talk to me.

217
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,920
I also don't know how to deal with my own feelings.

218
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,480
I promise

219
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,040
I’ll never hurt your feelings again.

220
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,600
But please understand me.

221
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,910
These things have never happened to me before.

222
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,480
Some things

223
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,030
take me a long time to understand.

224
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,160
Can you give me some more time?

225
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
I need some time too.

226
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,030
I still can’t get over him.

227
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
But I’ll always be here for you.

228
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,030
Go take a shower right now.

229
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,600
You’ve woken up

230
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,270
and haven't brushed.

231
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,750
Your breath probably smells rotten.

232
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,670
Go take a shower.

233
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
Here…

234
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,610
I got you some soy milk.

235
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,800
Sorry I said all those things to you.

236
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,280
Everything I needed to do is now done.

237
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,520
Let's continue our chat inside the room.

238
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,620
When will you pay?

239
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,960
You haven't paid yet.

240
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Sorry.

241
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,160
Keep the change.

242
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Miss.

243
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,080
Two bags of soy milk, please.

244
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,120
One with everything, another one only with

245
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
millets and red beans.

246
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,160
Millets and red beans,

247
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Another one with everything.

248
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,160
I’ve already bought it for you, silly kid.

249
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Hey!

250
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,680
Why are coming down here?

251
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,240
I’m hungry.

252
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,120
Did you order for me yet?

253
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,200
I did.

254
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,600
Here’s yours, only millets and red beans.

255
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
You could remember?

256
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,480
Are you wearing my shirt?

257
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,560
Yeah…

258
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,200
Can't I borrow it?

259
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Fine.

260
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
I’m here to meet Mr.Paiboon.

261
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Boss.

262
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,470
Kenji's still alive.

263
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,830
He’s waiting to meet you outside.

264
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,720
You’re not dead?

265
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,720
Did Tew...

266
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,000
really dare disobey my order?

267
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,560
Tew didn't make a mistake.

268
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,480
Instead, he spared my life on purpose.

269
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,180
"Tew" whom you trusted.

270
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,190
He told me to vanish

271
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,760
and never return again.

272
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,880
You think doing this...

273
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,600
will make me grateful for you?

274
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,320
Never show me your face again.

275
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,680
I’m going to tell the boss that you’re dead.

276
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,540
Then you must be a fool...

277
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,550
to come back here to me.

278
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
I’m not stupid.

279
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,280
But I want you to finally see

280
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,640
how loyal I am to you.

281
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,950
If you want me dead,

282
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,080
then I’ll die in front of you.

283
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,600
It was my fault

284
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,160
that I lied to you.

285
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,080
but I did it

286
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,400
because I wanted to stand beside you.

287
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,560
My goal is to surpass Tew.

288
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,640
Now that Tew’s out of the picture,

289
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,120
Please give me another chance.

290
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,640
And I won’t ever betray

291
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,160
and abandon you the way Tew did.

292
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Prove it.

293
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
I’ll give you another chance.

294
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,510
And it's your final one.

295
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,750
If you screw it up again,

296
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,550
your life is over.

297
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Thank you, Boss.

298
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Thank you.

299
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,840
Sir.

300
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,280
What made you so sure

301
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,160
that when he saw your face,

302
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,440
he wouldn't have killed you?

303
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,560
The boss is a wise man.

304
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,240
He’s reasonable.

305
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,880
Between sparing me

306
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,840
and killing me,

307
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,280
What do you think is more beneficial?

308
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
I knew it.

309
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,480
Someone with skills like yours

310
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
deserves a second chance.

311
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,760
Oh, I’ll make the very...

312
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,560
very good use of this opportunity.

313
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
From now on,

314
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,360
I’ll replace Tew.

315
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,040
And his name

316
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,920
will never come up by anyone again.

317
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Mr.Tew...

318
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,720
said I had till the middle of the month to pay.

319
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,240
How could you suddenly demand payment from me?

320
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,680
Everything has changed now.

321
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,080
I’m the one in control here,

322
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,000
not Tew.

323
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,320
When I demand it,

324
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
Then I must have it right away.

325
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,240
If you can't afford to pay,

326
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,880
I can't guarantee your safety.

327
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,400
Here, take it.

328
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,840
From now on,

329
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,280
I'll be in charge of this place.

330
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,960
Whatever has been loose,

331
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,760
I will handle it strictly.

332
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,640
Then you'll know...

333
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,880
how the actual business is done.

334
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Punk.

335
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Go!

336
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,040
There won’t be a problem, right?

337
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,360
If the pub owners refuse to pay,

338
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,800
it may cause problems for the boss.

339
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Why do you have so many doubts

340
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,000
about how I work, huh?

341
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,720
No, sir.

342
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,840
I'm just worried,

343
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,240
afraid there might be consequences.

344
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
If they have problems with the boss,

345
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,960
and he can’t resolve them.

346
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,800
I think it’s time...

347
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,920
for the geezer to retire himself.

348
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
And if it’s not the boss,

349
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
who will it be instead?

350
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
You?

351
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,560
Follow my path,

352
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,280
and I’ll show you.

353
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,240
Hey, I’m craving some shabu.

354
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,730
You're coming with me?

355
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,840
Sure,

356
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,120
I haven't had it in a while too...

357
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,640
Guy!

358
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,720
They shouldn't be driving that fast at the university.

359
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,920
Shitty habits die hard.

360
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Let's go.

361
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,900
You can let go now,

362
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,840
No more cars around.

363
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,680
Hold on,

364
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,040
You won't be watching where you walk for long.

365
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Come.

366
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,280
P'Eh.

367
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,040
Order's on the way.

368
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,560
What can I get ya today, handsome?

369
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,840
I’ll have Thai Basil Stir Fry crispy pork and century egg

370
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,080
with a sunny side egg,

371
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,560
and fried spring rolls.

372
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,080
Oh, and Strawberry Smoothie too.

373
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,360
Aren't you going to order your favorites?

374
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,760
All you ordered is what I like.

375
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,080
To let you know that

376
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
I remember what you like to eat.

377
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,840
Let me order for you too.

378
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,200
I’ll have Fried Rice with Shrimp Paste

379
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,080
and coconut milk.

380
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,480
Guy!

381
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,800
I don’t like shrimp paste.

382
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,520
I know what you don’t like

383
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,160
But you should try to eat them.

384
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,360
That'll do.

385
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,560
Okay, got it.

386
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,480
Guy!

387
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,000
Serves you right.

388
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,920
Why are you smiling?

389
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,720
If having to eat shrimp paste

390
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,240
makes you laugh,

391
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,600
then I'm down for it.

392
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,520
Hello, Tom.

393
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,920
(Hey, Guy.)

394
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,040
(So, will you be able to join us in the game?)

395
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,800
Uh...I'm sorry.

396
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,200
It was a little chaotic last time,

397
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,260
So I forgot.

398
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,720
(The competitive season is almost upon us.)

399
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,560
(The team will fall apart if you and Tew are still not here.)

400
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,840
(So, is Tew coming to play or not?)

401
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,280
I have no idea either.

402
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,280
But...

403
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,520
I guess Tew won't be coming back.

404
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,360
(Why? Something going on?)

405
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,640
(Hello? You still there?)

406
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,480
Sorry.

407
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,320
I guess I'm the only one left.

408
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,080
(How are we going to find a reliable new member in time?)

409
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,080
(Well, I better go discuss this with those guys first.)

410
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Okay, Tom.

411
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,080
Why are you staring at me?

412
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,760
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

413
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
but your speaker was so loud.

414
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,240
Can I play the game with you?

415
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,560
You want to play with me?

416
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Well...

417
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,200
I'd also like to try going into your world.

418
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Maybe I need to start opening my heart

419
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,870
to let Wahl step into my world.

420
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,700
That's right!

421
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,980
I'm on my way.

422
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,190
Go farm.

423
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,960
Got it.

424
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,080
Dodge!

425
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Quick!

426
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,200
We're close to winning!

427
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,960
- Yes!
- Woohoo!

428
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,700
Woohoo!

429
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,840
We won!

430
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Yes!

431
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,560
Didn't think we would win.

432
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,280
You're actually good at this.

433
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,720
You've just started playing for the first time and won.

434
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
Truly gifted.

435
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm too flattered, Master.

436
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,120
I didn't praise you too much, you know?

437
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,160
You're good with many things, Wahl.

438
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,400
You know that?

439
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,720
You do well in your studies,

440
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,920
good at sports,

441
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,720
and you're a social butterfly too.

442
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,240
You're good with everything.

443
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,200
In your eyes,

444
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
Am I like that?

445
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Mm-hmm.

446
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,150
I'm not good when it comes to you, though.

447
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,960
What Wahl is doing right now...

448
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,040
is what I've always wanted from him.

449
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,080
But I'm not sure why

450
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,000
my heart isn't excited to welcome him.

451
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,160
Do you really not want him to see you?

452
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
I shouldn't.

453
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,520
Guy should be in his own world.

454
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,200
He has already started a new life.

455
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
You're moving on?

456
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
Then...

457
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,040
I guess you'll keep making the sad puppy face.

458
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Roger that.

459
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,949
What if Guy rejects us?

460
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,960
He's coming this far, so he has to agree.

461
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,719
There are certain types of people,

462
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,560
who wish to refuse in person.

463
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,320
I guess it's like having manners.

464
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Damn it.

465
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,560
If he rejects us this time,

466
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,880
I'll take out the red-hot coal in the stove

467
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,699
and sear his ass with it.

468
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,400
Make him...

469
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
Suffer.

470
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,639
Tom.

471
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,760
He's coming this way, what searing?

472
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,719
Then we're good.

473
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,679
This is Wahl.

474
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,400
I believe you all still remember him.

475
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,920
I was the one who offered to come play the game.

476
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,880
Please let me join the team.

477
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,120
You may join now, right here, for free.

478
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,520
Hold up.

479
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,240
Don't get too excited now.

480
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,560
So, have you ever played it?

481
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,960
I've never, but I'm a quick learner.

482
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,920
Not stubborn, and easily teachable!

483
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,040
But I won't go easy on you.

484
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,520
You can go hard on me.

485
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,360
Come on.

486
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,480
Since we're here now,

487
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,840
let's have a quick game.

488
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,400
Get ready.

489
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,240
But I'm not very good at the game.

490
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,160
I'll teach you.

491
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Muffin!

492
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
Change seats with me.

493
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,680
Come on, sis.

494
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,400
All right, I'll teach you myself.

495
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,520
Look at this hag.

496
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,240
I'm about to get ready, just a second.

497
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,120
Wahl is still the same person he's always been.

498
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,000
He's always been someone worth approaching.

499
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,440
Send the invitation!

500
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,080
Things are better the way they are now, Guy.

501
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,300
I really hope that your happiness...

502
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,000
always continues.

503
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Please don't, Tew.

504
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Guy?

505
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,000
Are you going to run away again?

506
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
Didn't you see that

507
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,400
that I'd almost killed you?

508
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,720
So what?

509
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,240
You didn't, right?

510
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,720
Don't be so sure.

511
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,960
Stop following me.

512
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,160
Who exactly was following?

513
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,200
Wasn't it you...

514
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Who have been stalking me...

515
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,160
Since the soy milk shop?

516
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,040
Tew!

517
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,320
Here's your soy milk.

518
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,080
Okay, how much?

519
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,410
Twenty baht.

520
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,670
Here you go.

521
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,600
I got it, let's go.

522
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Why are you spacing out?

523
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,480
Let's go!

524
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,520
Flank too.

525
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,280
Shit.

526
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,000
Wahl's actually pretty good.

527
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,720
Nice.

528
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,320
There was also earlier too.

529
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,240
You think I didn't see you?

530
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,360
Seriously,

531
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,950
Why are you following me?

532
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,680
I only wanted to know how you're doing.

533
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,910
You were the one who pushed me away from your life.

534
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,000
But now you're doing this?

535
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,670
I wanted you to return to your own world.

536
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,520
Seeing you this happy,

537
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
makes me happy too.

538
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,310
Do you realize...

539
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,920
that I'm not happy at all?

540
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,000
My world without you

541
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,200
is a terrible place to live in.

542
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,030
At first,

543
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,190
I thought I was okay.

544
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,100
I thought I could go back to the way I was.

545
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,770
Back to liking Wahl.

546
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,240
Back to my own world.

547
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,120
But even though Wahl

548
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,400
could give me everything I wanted.

549
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,320
All the time.

550
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,560
All the attention.

551
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,000
You know what?

552
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,720
It was never enough for me.

553
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,480
Ever since you were gone,

554
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,040
My life hasn't been happy at all.

555
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,630
And one other thing.

556
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,960
You've turned me into a selfish person

557
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,960
Because I couldn't live

558
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,240
without you.

559
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,560
Will you return to be my side once more?

560
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,590
(Could not trade for the world)

561
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:55,760
(With the best thing I have cherish right now)

562
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,500
(And it is you)

563
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,400
(Have never seen no one)

564
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,600
(That’s the best thing that came across me and my heart.)

565
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,040
(Should we call it our area)

566
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
I love you.

567
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,660
(Your smile has healed and calm the heart,)

568
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,420
(From things that crashing down the heart)

569
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,550
(The answer that my heart will only need,)

570
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,450
(It is you, Only you and always you)

571
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, what about Guy?

572
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,520
He's already gone home.

573
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,520
Thought he said he was going to the toilet.

574
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,560
Oh.

575
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,320
He said he was feeling sick,

576
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
so I told him to go home.

577
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,200
What's up with him?

578
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,560
I'm still hyped up right now.

579
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,680
I was about to play one more round.

580
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,720
It's good that guy left,

581
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,440
so I can sit with Wahl.

582
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,200
Let's play one more round.

583
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Come on, Wahl.

584
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,760
A bit more.

585
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
Send the invitation.

586
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,520
I'm waiting.

587
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,440
We're probably getting new players on the team.

588
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,560
Wait.

589
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,680
I can't catch my breath.

590
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,640
Stay right here.

591
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,720
Don't follow.

592
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,120
Boss?

593
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,960
Please help, Tew.

594
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,800
Mr. Paiboon is going to be assassinated.
