1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Do you want to know who I am?

2
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Open your eyes.

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Open up your eyes.

4
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Tew..

5
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,400
Who exactly are you?

6
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,840
Earlier,

7
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,240
I didn't tell you the truth about who I am

8
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
Because I was afraid

9
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,800
that you would be in danger too

10
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,640
if they found out that you knew me.

11
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,720
My life

12
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,800
wasn't as wonderful as you imagined.

13
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,079
I'm going to tell you the truth.

14
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,520
Can’t steal my kills. Not following,

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Come! Let's go!

16
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,970
My only happiness back then began after school.

17
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,320
So I can go do whatever I want.

18
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Killed!

19
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Hey!

20
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,320
Why the hell are you two so loud?

21
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,920
Let's get going.

22
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,570
See ya soon.

23
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,910
What is he talking about?

24
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,140
I don’t know, let’s keep playing.

25
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,720
Damn it, we died.

26
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,840
Agree with you.

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
Yeah, I was just getting heat up.

28
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,920
I was addicted to it and had been playing it every day

29
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,470
Someone once asked me how games are fun.

30
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,380
Tew.

31
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Let's have some lunch.

32
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Yes, dad.

33
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,440
I thought aside from killing time,

34
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,920
the most important thing was that

35
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,410
it let me play as a character

36
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,520
Who could do exciting things

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
instead of boring ones.

38
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,520
Wow, smells so good.

39
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
Anything I can help, dad?

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,600
It’s all right, the omelet is almost done.

41
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,720
Go wait at the table.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Okay.

43
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,440
I lived with my father.

44
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,880
Life wasn’t a luxury

45
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,200
but it was bearable.

46
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
The look so good, dad!

47
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,280
If they look good then eat up, son.

48
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Okay.

49
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,920
Your omelet is the best!

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,230
As usual for the food I cook, son.

51
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Dad.

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,160
Did you get a lot of customers?

53
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,690
Water.

54
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Dad,

55
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
Are you alright?

56
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
I’m fine, son.

57
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
That was nothing.

58
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,440
Okay

59
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
Come on, let’s eat.

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Here, dad, eat more.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Thanks, son.

62
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,159
Hit it.

63
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,880
I had been living like that every day,

64
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,840
the same for many years.

65
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,640
Avenge me!

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,080
Until one day

67
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,800
Everything suddenly changed,

68
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,210
and nothing was the same again.

69
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,760
Yes, aunty?

70
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Tew!

71
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,240
Your dad doesn’t look good,

72
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,840
I’ve seen him coughing nonstop.

73
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,280
You better come see him.

74
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,240
Okay,

75
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
I’m going right over there.

76
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Want us to get physical?

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,500
Hey, what do you think you’re doing?

78
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
Being a hero, baby face?

79
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
What the fuck?

80
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
Why the hell are you getting in the way?

81
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Hey!

82
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,700
Not today,

83
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,159
My dad's sick, I need to get to him quickly.

84
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,520
What's the rush?

85
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
After you punched us like that,

86
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,520
You think we'll just let you go?

87
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Mess him up.

88
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,200
Get over here.

89
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,350
So tough?

90
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
You’re tough?

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,880
You’re tough?

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,240
Dad…

93
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,960
My dad's really sick, I need to get to him.

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,600
Dad?

95
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,280
Screw you dad.

96
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
He’s not my dad.

97
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Go on, get!

98
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Loser.

99
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
Go find your dad.

100
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,920
- Aunty.
- Tew.

101
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Dad.

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Dad.

103
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Dad.

104
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Dad.

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,159
Please wake up.

106
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Dad.

107
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
Die!

108
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
No!

109
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,290
I still remember what happened that night clearly.

110
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,420
I thought I wouldn't make it...

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,090
and that dying was fine.

112
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,810
In fact, it wasn't so bad

113
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,000
that I could join my father.

114
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,720
Remember how I said that

115
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,600
you can't be sure of anything in life?

116
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
That was it.

117
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
I...

118
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,840
hadn’t had a chance to say goodbye to my dad.

119
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,000
And he...

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,680
also hadn't had a chance to talk to me.

121
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,440
We won't know when we'll part ways…

122
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,920
We see each other every day,

123
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
but we still haven't said that that.

124
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,280
It must have been really painful for you.

125
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,240
Whoever said that time would ease the pain,

126
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,200
for me...

127
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,530
that was all a lie.

128
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
That day

129
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,760
marked the start

130
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,540
of my career in this business.

131
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,930
And the man who saved you,

132
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,360
Who was he?

133
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
Mr.Paiboon.

134
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,300
A real estate entrepreneur.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh!

136
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,520
You mean Mr.Paiboon the billionaire?

137
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,910
Behind the scenes are casinos,

138
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,200
gambling websites,

139
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
and many other gray businesses.

140
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,650
I cannot tell you everything.

141
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
I understand.

142
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,960
When the people who were after me

143
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,200
found out I was there,

144
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
They didn't dare to touch me again.

145
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,120
But instead, I was the one

146
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,210
who nearly murdered them.

147
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,750
Until one point,

148
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,040
I couldn't return to live a normal life anymore.

149
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
so I had to quit school

150
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,320
to work for him

151
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,000
What’s your name again?

152
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,950
I’m Tew.

153
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Tew?

154
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,320
I’ve heard that you alone

155
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,080
could take on the whole gang?

156
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,380
You’ve got the balls,

157
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I like that.

158
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,710
Wanna come work for me?

159
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,450
This gun

160
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,120
doesn’t have a registry

161
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,130
You can use it to shoot anyone

162
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,490
in a way nobody can track you down.

163
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,560
But working for me

164
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,270
has two rules

165
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,280
that you must follow.

166
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Rule number one,

167
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,920
You must not lie to me.

168
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Number two,

169
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,840
You must not betray your own allies.

170
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,850
Once you touch a gun,

171
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,040
You can't go back to being an ordinary person.

172
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,640
I never plan on going back to normal life anyway.

173
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,320
After that, I started working for him.

174
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,320
Started from being a small thug

175
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,400
who collected debts for his boss,

176
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,520
to becoming a senior,

177
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,320
then becoming one of two of the so-called

178
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,530
Left and right-hand men of Mr. Paiboon.

179
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Shit...

180
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,760
Mr.Paiboon has given me a new life

181
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,370
and I must spend the rest of my life working for him.

182
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,240
I’ve told you everything

183
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,260
and now it's up to you

184
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,580
if you can handle the truth.

185
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,420
I understand everything

186
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,190
about how you've become like this.

187
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,430
But what I don’t

188
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,690
is why you had to lie about running the shabu place.

189
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Well...

190
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,690
I didn’t know how to tell you back then.

191
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
Didn’t you say it yourself

192
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
that I was your friend?

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,720
If I was,

194
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,100
then why didn’t you tell me straight up?

195
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,290
It may sound ridiculous like what a kid would say,

196
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,620
but for me, the word “Friend”...

197
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,060
matters more than you ever think.

198
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Guy.

199
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Guy.

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Guy, wait.

201
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,680
Hello.

202
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,380
This is bad, boss.

203
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,510
Hurry up and come here.

204
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Nice place.

205
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
When will it open?

206
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,770
Why didn’t you tell me you’re running a new business?

207
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Sit down.

208
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,800
May I take a seat.

209
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,120
This location

210
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,800
is not in our domain.

211
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,920
What were you thinking?

212
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,800
Doing something like this,

213
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,220
are you finding a new path

214
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,680
to get away from me?

215
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,980
I've never thought of anything like that, boss.

216
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,770
Do you remember the first day

217
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
that I handed you a gun?

218
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,950
Once you touch a gun,

219
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,320
you cannot go back to being an ordinary person.

220
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I never forget.

221
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,840
I’m opening this place here

222
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,320
because I want to expand an extra territory for you.

223
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,760
I haven't informed you yet

224
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,640
because I'm afraid the others won't agree

225
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,000
I want to wait for everything to come into place first.

226
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,320
This area

227
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
used to belongs to Mr.Pong.

228
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,000
But after his funeral,

229
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
his offspring have been quarreling

230
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,320
and their strength has weakened.

231
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,240
I think this is a good opportunity

232
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,680
to take over this area

233
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,600
in order to fortify strength for you.

234
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
When I’m done setting up this location,

235
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,370
our brothers may come make

236
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,370
a living here with out problems.

237
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,420
You aren't attempting to make money

238
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,670
behind my back, right?

239
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,680
Such things cannot be kept secret.

240
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,080
Lying...

241
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,680
conflicts with my simple rules.

242
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,450
And whenever someone breaks the rule

243
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,280
they will get

244
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,760
only one kind of punishment.

245
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,440
If you think I’m lying

246
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,380
or betraying you...

247
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,680
you’re free to execute me right now.

248
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,420
You’re testing me, Tew?

249
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,380
Do you know..

250
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,080
what makes humans and dogs different?

251
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,960
It’s the loyalty.

252
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
Dogs…

253
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,680
when they know who owns them,

254
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,060
they will love

255
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,300
and being loyal

256
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,760
in the greatest sense

257
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,320
until the day they die.

258
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,360
Even though the dogs are very faithful,

259
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,620
humans still use them as an insult.

260
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,780
Dirty mutt.

261
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,860
Dog brain.

262
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,400
Despite the fact that they are better than certain humans.

263
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,770
I’ve raised many dogs.

264
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,970
I can tell

265
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
which ones are untamable.

266
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
But you...

267
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
you’re not untamable.

268
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
I need to talk to you in private.

269
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,280
Boss got away!

270
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,800
When he put the pistol on his head

271
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
I almost peed my pants.

272
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,920
Look, my heart’s still racing.

273
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,600
The big boss won’t bother with goons like us.

274
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
No need to be scared.

275
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,440
I'll stop being scared

276
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,400
if you promise to keep me safe.

277
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,880
You wanna quit if you're that scared?

278
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Never.

279
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
Then stop clinging on to me

280
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Go find something else to do.

281
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,360
I’m going to clear the store’s back.

282
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,520
You made me lose control.

283
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,920
Careful,

284
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,620
Next time I’ll do the same to your heart.

285
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,320
I want you to deal with the person who broke the rules.

286
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,240
Who was it?

287
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,800
The person who lied to me that you betrayed me.

288
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Kenji?

289
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,530
I believe he did that

290
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,520
because he was worried about you.

291
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,120
A skilled individual like him

292
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,000
can still bring you much more benefit.

293
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,640
The rules are the rules,

294
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,760
Otherwise, how can I rule over anyone?

295
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,000
Sorry, boss.

296
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,830
[Tom: Are you back, Guy?...]

297
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,880
[...Get ready to practice today.]

298
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,360
[Muffin: Get Tew to come too,...]

299
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,240
[...I texted him but he didn’t read it.]

300
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,320
[Don’t bother him, he’s probably busy.]

301
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,430
[Tom: Then when the hell is everyone...]

302
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,200
[...going to practice together?]]

303
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
[Also, I'm quitting this game.]

304
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,000
What? We’ve been playing together for a long time.

305
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,440
[Tom: Anyone got his number? Ask him why he leaves.]

306
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,950
[Muffin: I've called, but his phone's off.]

307
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,350
Tew?

308
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,840
Hey, what are you doing?

309
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
Nothing.

310
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
Let’s go outside.

311
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,170
After so much time in your room,

312
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,170
you're going to merge with your pillows.

313
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
I…

314
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,320
kinda don’t want to go out.

315
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Just go,

316
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,040
I want to get some ice cream.

317
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,480
He shows up when I’m confused,

318
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,200
Should I refuse him?

319
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Without you, ice cream won't taste good.

320
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,040
But I also don't know why

321
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,720
I can't turn him down.

322
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,160
Come,

323
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
I’ll treat you.

324
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,950
Here.

325
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Your ice cream.

326
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
Take it.

327
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,720
Eat it.

328
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,090
It's going to melt.

329
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,480
Don't want to eat ice cream with me anymore?

330
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
So, how were things going on?

331
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,240
Have you talked to him yet?

332
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I'm feel bad for you.

333
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,400
That you accidentally became friend with a thug.

334
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,250
But It was also my fault

335
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,250
for being away from you earlier.

336
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,040
Well, you were always with the gamers

337
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,310
so you made a new friend who was like that.

338
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,840
I’m worried about you, Guy.

339
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,920
Really worried.

340
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,880
Hanging around that kind of person was dangerous.

341
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,800
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

342
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,960
You’re the most important person to me.

343
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,640
I'm never going to lose you.

344
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,440
The most important person…

345
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,800
And then I’m back to the same spot,

346
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,680
feeling the same for him again.

347
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,880
Hey, go check who it is.

348
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,640
I’m here for Kenji.

349
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
whoever is not involved get out.

350
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,840
You've got the guts to step into my room.

351
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,440
If you didn’t stab me in the back

352
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,710
then I wouldn’t have to.

353
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Why are you coming to kill me?

354
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,200
The boss told me to come here.

355
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,360
Guess he thought you forgot his rules.

356
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
One, don’t lie.

357
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,400
Two, don’t betray.

358
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,640
You’re the one who lied,

359
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,960
You’re the one who betrayed him.

360
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,600
Well, too bad he didn’t think so.

361
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,240
So that’s why you’re coming to kill me.

362
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,520
Time to die, Tew.

363
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,800
Anywhere you want to go next?

364
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Well then,

365
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,320
I'll sleep in your room tonight, okay?

366
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,240
I can sleep by myself.

367
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,280
No, I won't let you be alone.

368
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
I’m worried.

369
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,080
I really can be alone.

370
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,400
Please don't say no to my determination,

371
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,360
I’ve already planned

372
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,840
that I will sleep with you today,

373
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
So please let me.

374
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Fine.

375
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,880
It's not that hard, huh?

376
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,360
Stop playing hard-to-get.

377
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
What the fuck?

378
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Not suspicious of people you slept with?

379
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
If you’re going to shoot, then shoot.

380
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Shoot!

381
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Pull the trigger!

382
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Shoot me!

383
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,720
Even if I never liked your face

384
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,880
or knew you were always trying to get rid of me,

385
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,280
I don't want to kill

386
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,120
a helpless person.

387
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,320
You think this

388
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,600
will make me feel grateful to you?

389
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
Don't ever show me your face again.

390
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,360
I’ll tell the boss you’ve died.

391
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
What are you doing?

392
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
Changing the sheets,

393
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
I haven’t changed them in many days.

394
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,080
You should have waited for me.

395
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,680
I can do it.

396
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,760
What do you mean you can? Let me help.

397
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,480
Easy.

398
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
I’m dropping it now.

399
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,280
Sorry, I slipped over a blanket.

400
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,920
It’s okay,

401
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,040
are you hurt?

402
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
I’m not, It was nothing.

403
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Your face looks red.

404
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Are you hot?

405
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,080
Go take a shower,

406
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,440
I’ll finish the rest.

407
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,160
Go on, I’ll do it.

408
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,040
Hey,

409
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
What are you looking at?

410
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Still keeping the pictures

411
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,120
we took when we were at the camp?

412
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,160
Where?

413
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Here.

414
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Yeah…

415
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,720
I’ve been keeping them.

416
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,360
You want me to throw them away or what?

417
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,720
Could you possibly throw me away?

418
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,800
Ouch!

419
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,980
My ears.

420
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,200
Did that hurt?

421
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,400
What a crybaby.

422
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Hey,

423
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,800
remember this picture?

424
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Yeah, I can remember,

425
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,680
the strawberry smoothie had poured all over me.

426
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,320
May I apologize? I’m sorry.

427
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,560
I’ll bow down to your feet.

428
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,520
That’s my head!

429
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,040
Oh, really?

430
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,200
Thought that was your feet.

431
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,560
Were you going to hit me?

432
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Again?

433
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,880
I like seeing you smile, Guy.

434
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,680
It’s like everything around me

435
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,750
has stopped for a brief moment.

436
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,880
Only Wahl's eyes are...

437
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,680
expressing some kind of emotion.

438
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,800
Sending towards me.

439
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,160
If I’m not being narcissistic,

440
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,450
I think I can sense that

441
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,250
Wahl has some kind of feeling for me.

442
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,560
I’m tired, let’s go to bed.

443
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,320
Wahl.

444
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,449
Maybe I’m being too self-centered.

445
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,710
Wahl would never think of me

446
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,860
as more than a friend

447
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,600
I need to put an end to my feelings.

448
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,600
Are you in the bathroom?

449
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,050
(Sorry, the number you’ve called can't be reached.)

450
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Where did he go?

451
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,560
(Sorry, the number you’ve called can't be reached.)

452
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Guy.

453
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Guy.

454
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Are you alright?

455
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,440
Why are you here?

456
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,770
I’m coming to see, Guy.

457
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,320
You've tricked my friend.

458
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
And now you have the nerve to come see him?

459
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,720
Not a single chance that

460
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,800
I’ll let Guy be around a thug like you.

461
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,280
Stay back.

462
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,420
I’ll talk to Guy.

463
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,360
What, are you mad?

464
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,320
Are you going to shoot or stab me?

465
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,960
Go on, do it!

466
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,360
We're loud,

467
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,680
but Guy hasn't come out yet,

468
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,760
that means he's not here.

469
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,990
Where is he?

470
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,480
If something bad happens to him

471
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,920
and we’re too late,

472
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,200
It’ll be far worse.

473
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,480
I have no idea where he is either.

474
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,500
Let's go eat together, son.

475
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,000
I’m not hungry yet, mom.

476
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,040
Is everything okay?

477
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,320
Everything’s fine, mom.

478
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,920
I'm just a little tired.

479
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,520
Or did you fight with Wahl?

480
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,320
I usually see the two of you coming home together.

481
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,760
But all of a sudden you came home by yourself.

482
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,040
What was the fight about?

483
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,000
What fight, mom?

484
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,630
What is there for friends to fight over?

485
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,400
You came to get me to eat, right?

486
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,440
Let's go.

487
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,520
There are lots of clams, curry, chili and eggs.

488
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,260
Your dad is also waiting.

489
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,160
Bring the rice here, son. Let’s eat

490
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,000
Come sit town.

491
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Wow!

492
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,560
Twenty million baht, he donated again?

493
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,480
He’s incredibly wealthy.

494
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,160
Who made what donation?

495
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,960
It’s Mr.Paiboon,

496
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,480
The Chinese association president.

497
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,240
He donated money to help the victims in Chiang Rai.

498
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,280
He's great.

499
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,520
What a kind and thoughtful person he is.

500
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,600
It’s because he has a lot of money, mom.

501
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,200
That’s why he can do stuffs like that.

502
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,400
These people,

503
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,080
sometime they do things just for the public image.

504
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,760
Why did you say that, Guy?

505
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,720
This man, he has always been

506
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,280
very generous since the beginning.

507
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,600
- Can I have some rice?
- Just eat, mom.

508
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,760
Just a bit,

509
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,720
I’ll have the chili and boiled veggies.

510
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,910
Done with the clams then eat the chicken next.

511
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,720
Tastes so good, dad.

512
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
How are things?

513
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
Good?

514
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Very good.

515
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,200
I did my best to cook them.

516
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,000
Nice!

517
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,800
So good, more rice please.

518
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,000
Will Wahl call me?

519
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,920
Why do you expect him to call

520
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,080
when you left without telling him?

521
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,640
Is he not going to worry about you?

522
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,560
No, you’re just his friend.

523
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,680
Not his boyfriend.

524
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,360
He won't call you for sure.

525
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Will he?

526
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,400
Why did Tew call me so many times?

527
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,280
Didn’t you say

528
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,030
that I was your friend?

529
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,800
If I was,

530
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,400
then why didn’t you tell me straight up?

531
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,760
It may sound ridiculous like what a kid would say,

532
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,480
but for me, the word “Friend”

533
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,440
matters more than you think.

534
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Guy.

535
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Guy.

536
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Guy, wait!

537
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,280
Should I call him back?

538
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,640
I’m so sorry.

539
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,210
What’s going on with me?

540
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,760
What am I even running away from?

541
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
Guy!

542
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Tew?

543
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
How did you get here?

544
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,440
I wanted to see you,

545
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,880
so I had to keep looking until I found you.

546
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,520
Are you still mad at me?

547
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,920
I wasn’t angry with you.

548
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,080
I just wasn’t sure

549
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,840
what I was supposed to do next.

550
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,480
As you've already known,

551
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,560
I didn't have many friends.

552
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,470
Even though I had a friend like Wahl,

553
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,910
I still found myself thinking of him more than friends.

554
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,480
So, I had to drag myself into the gaming world.

555
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,660
The world where I thought I belonged.

556
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,900
I believed that

557
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,650
it was the best place for me...

558
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,240
to show who I truly was.

559
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,060
But that's it,

560
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,920
I guess other people wouldn’t agree with me.

561
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,960
By "The other people" you meant me, right?

562
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,120
Actually, you know what?

563
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,160
You weren't wrong that you were like this.

564
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,010
I get why you didn't tell me the truth from the start,

565
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,010
I really do.

566
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,600
Because if I were you,

567
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,970
I wouldn't tell either.

568
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,400
If you've understood,

569
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,520
then why didn't you speak to me?

570
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,200
I've understood everything,

571
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
but I was still sad,

572
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,660
and I didn't know what to do.

573
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,720
I know

574
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,090
why you feel this way.

575
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,960
Because it comes from the feelings

576
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,920
feelings you have to me.

577
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,600
What is it?

578
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,640
You like me.

579
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,240
The way you feel like this.

580
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,400
Being upset like this.

581
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,440
Because you feel the same as me

582
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,360
that you were the closest to me.

583
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,280
But when we got closer

584
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,400
it felt like we didn't know each other at all.

585
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,600
Which made you disappointed.

586
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,320
What are you talking about?

587
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,120
How could you possibly know more than I do?

588
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,840
Then just say that you didn't like me,

589
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,080
and I'll leave you alone

590
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,640
and never bother you again.

591
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,000
Little boy...

592
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,480
I like you too.

593
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,280
I've known I like you since the first time we met.

594
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,600
But I haven't told you my feelings

595
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,160
because I didn't know

596
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,000
How to tell you about myself.

597
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,160
But now

598
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,470
you know.

599
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,000
Because of this, I've decided that

600
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,220
I'll quit the gangster life.

601
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,250
I want you by my side,

602
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,960
Please let me do this for you.

603
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,360
(In time that you are here)

604
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,920
(I am so grateful)

605
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,210
(It's warm and so gentle)

606
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,230
(Happiness in my heart)

607
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,540
(But it’s just yesterday,)

608
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,030
(Love is a delusion)

609
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:42,750
(It changed, The time is spinning)

610
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,340
(Here it comes today,)

611
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,900
(As he came into)

612
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,200
(He held all over my heart)

613
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,710
(It’s like he used to it)

614
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:01,140
(Now it’s so intense,)

615
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,500
(Cause I know he’s the one)

616
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:11,130
(But there’s another one, Who I still love)

617
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:18,200
(Now it’s time to choose, For my heart)

618
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,850
(Please tell me what I should do)

619
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:28,040
(What if I choose him, Will he break my heart?)

620
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,930
(Please listen to me, My heart)

621
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:38,950
(I can’t stand hurting anyone)

622
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,090
(It is too hard, What should I do?)

623
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,610
(What if to do?)

624
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,730
(It is too hard, Please tell me)

625
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:11,820
(It is too hard, What should I do?)

626
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:20,000
(Now it’s time to choose, For my heart)

627
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,710
(Please tell me what I should do.)

628
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:29,520
(What if I choose him, Will he break my heart?)

629
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,000
(Please listen to me, my heart)

630
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,820
(I can’t stand hurting anyone)

631
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,940
(It is too hard, What should I do?)

632
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,950
(What to do?)

633
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,950
(It is too hard,)

634
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:58,400
(Please tell me,...)

635
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:04,110
(What to do?)
