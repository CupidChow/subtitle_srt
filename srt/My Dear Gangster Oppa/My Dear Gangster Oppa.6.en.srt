1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,840
Loy... Loy Kratong

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,320
Loy... Loy Kratong!

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,160
Loy Kratong, My ass.

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Guy?

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Where's guy?

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,000
Boss's missing too.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Guy.

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Guy!

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,880
What's going on?

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,520
Why did all of us fall asleep?

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,010
How tragic...

12
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,550
to fall in love with Tew.

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
You must have a death wish.

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,759
(As when our eyes meet every time,)

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,820
(I have seen you and myself in there)

16
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,500
(As when your smile captured my heart,)

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,030
(From the day that we first met. I’ve falling for you)

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,350
(Your smile has healed and calm the heart,)

19
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,650
(From things that crashing down the heart)

20
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:07,050
(The answer that my heart will only need,)

21
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:13,270
(It is you. Only you and always you)

22
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,900
(Could not trade for the world)

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,380
(With the best thing I have cherish right now)

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,960
(And it is you)

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,780
(Have never seen no one)

26
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,079
(That’s the best thing that came across me and my heart.)

27
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,300
(What should we call it...)

28
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,090
(The place where it’s only ours.)

29
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,250
(The place where it’s you and me)

30
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,300
(From now and ever)

31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,730
(The place where we leave our tears and wounds)

32
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,790
(Cause it is our area)

33
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,430
(And I)

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,520
I believe we were drugged.

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,810
Who drugged us?

36
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,240
Why?

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,660
Or were we robbed?

38
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,560
Well, nothing's missing.

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,720
Everyone,

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,800
You should get back home.

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
I'll go find Guy on my own.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
Let me help you.

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,960
Guy's also like my brother.

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
It's too dangerous.

45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,680
You all should go home.

46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,800
Lots of people should help us find him faster.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,160
I'll also help you, Tew.

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
I said go home right now!

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,840
Do you not get what I said?

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,000
It's complicated

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
not just some fun and games.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,440
But now I can't explain much.

53
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,600
You should just go.

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I beg you.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
Can I trust you with this?

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,000
Guy means the world to me.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm going to bring him back for sure.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Then you must get this situation handled.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
Don't make me take matter into my own hands.

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Let's go.

61
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,280
Please let us know when you find him.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
How much do you know about Boss?

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
You think he drugged us?

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
He was the last person

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,810
to pass us the glass.

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,210
I'm sorry,

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
that I brought him close to us.

68
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,440
I didn't suspect him either.

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,600
Everything I've done

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,159
is because I'm really into you.

71
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,680
What if I say I'm not interested in you?

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
Then I wouldn't mind at all.

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
But I won't stop trying.

74
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,120
Seriously,

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,010
What's so interesting about me?

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,840
Boss.

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,600
You can start punishing me now.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,560
Make me hurt so I can learn from this.

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm not going to put all the blame on you.

80
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Fuck.

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Enough!

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,200
If you want to make it up to me so bad,

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,300
then you must help me figure out where to find Guy.

84
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,890
[One Day Before]

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Tul.

86
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Can I borrow your phone?

87
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,159
What for?

88
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,800
Come on.

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
I won't transfer your money.

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
All done.

91
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,200
I've installed the "Where Are You" app on your phone

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,360
and linked it with mine.

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,090
Now we know each other's location.

94
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,360
So that I'll know when you're coming to work.

95
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,740
Or when you want to surprise me

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
You can use this app.

97
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
Gimme that.

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,530
Get to work.

99
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,650
I got an idea!

100
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,840
Wherever Boss is,

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,320
Guy has to be there.

102
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,600
They must've got people ready to greet us.

103
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,240
That's great,

104
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,000
I really need some relieve.

105
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,570
Aren't them Kenji's henchman?

106
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,530
Shit, Boss is Kenji's men.

107
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,170
Tul, are you alright?

108
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,320
Still alive.

109
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,640
But I don't think I can go any further.

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,040
Stay, I'll take it from here.

111
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,960
Sorry.

112
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
Boss.

113
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
You gotta survive, alright?

114
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Help!

115
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,600
Cry louder!

116
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
so Tew knows where you are.

117
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Tul!

118
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
Let go of me!

119
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,570
I said let go.

120
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,640
Please let me help.

121
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,040
I don't want anything to happend to you.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,970
Still brave enough to say that?

123
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,320
I trusted you.

124
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,080
But you're just Kenji's slave.

125
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,090
I did it because I had to.

126
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,610
You have your own master,

127
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,290
and so do I.

128
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,360
I said cry for help louder.

129
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,760
Cry!

130
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
Help!

131
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,920
Tew!

132
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,600
Please help!

133
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,720
Help, Tew!

134
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,440
You can punch me how many times you want.

135
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
But I'll get you out of here.

136
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,840
You want redemption?

137
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,080
Go help my boss

138
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,520
And I'll give you another chance.

139
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,000
Then how are you going to escape?

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,670
I'll work it out.

141
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,960
Tew!

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Help me!

143
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,280
Tew!

144
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Help me.

145
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,720
Guy.

146
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Help.

147
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,760
You're late.

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,840
Kenji.

149
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
Why the hell are you doing this?

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
Whatever that reason is,

151
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm here now.

152
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,040
Let Guy go.

153
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,320
This doesn't involve other people.

154
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,880
Other people, huh?

155
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,320
You're telling me this sweet face

156
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,280
means others to you?

157
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
You're panicking like that.

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,760
Guess he's not the others,

159
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,200
but rather your lover.

160
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
Any last words?

161
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,760
Tew!

162
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,200
Kenji!

163
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,880
Even if you do this,

164
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,920
You'll still be a pitiful scum as the same.

165
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,930
Just come fight me and end this.

166
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,960
I know that guys like you aren't scared of dying.

167
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,000
But if I want to hurt you,

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,080
then I'll have to let you live with the guilt

169
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,600
of not being able to save your loved one.

170
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,400
Tew, help me.

171
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
You're all right now, Guy.

172
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,480
I thought I'd never see you again.

173
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm here.

174
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Don't worry.

175
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Come.

176
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Hey!

177
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Tul.

178
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,080
Your arm is badly bleeding.

179
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,520
It's nothing.

180
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,920
You guys better get going.

181
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,040
Are you alright, Tul?

182
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm still alright.

183
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,080
One drink would fix everything.

184
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Get in.

185
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Tul.

186
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
Go, just go.

187
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Tul.

188
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,400
Boss saved my life.

189
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,520
Look.

190
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,160
At least let him explain why he betrayed us.

191
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Then it's up to you to decide.

192
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,960
Get in the car.

193
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm still good, Tew.

194
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,200
We've arrived at the room.

195
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
You're safe now.

196
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,370
Please stay with me.

197
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,640
I don't want to be alone.

198
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,160
Don't be afraid.

199
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,240
Kenji won't be able to harm you anymore.

200
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,880
Let's go take a shower.

201
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,640
then you'll get some rest.

202
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Tew.

203
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,360
Thank you for risking your life to save me.

204
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
I'll always protect you.

205
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,520
You need to apply this

206
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,800
to make the swelling go down.

207
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Leave me alone.

208
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,720
I really want the best for you,

209
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,280
even when you've never seen it.

210
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,960
Did you really want the best for me?

211
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,880
I was sent

212
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,160
to be Kenji's infiltrator.

213
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,599
It was stupid of me

214
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,680
to trust people like you.

215
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,760
But while I was with you,

216
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,050
in this environment,

217
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,520
I felt like I was one of yours.

218
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
How funny.

219
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,090
At first, I almost changed my mind not to drug Guy.

220
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,000
I didn't want to do it.

221
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,440
Do you know why?

222
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,560
Because I really do like you.

223
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
I owed my life to Kenji,

224
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
I had to repay him.

225
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
Otherwise, he'd kill me.

226
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,200
I'll make things right with you however you want.

227
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Please.

228
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,560
Bro.

229
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,760
I forgive you about that.

230
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,280
But you have to stay out of our lives from now on.

231
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,880
Get out of here.

232
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,720
And don't ever come back.

233
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,480
Think of it like I've never known you.

234
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,680
You're having a little fever.

235
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,200
Better?

236
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm sorry, Guy.

237
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,320
[Two Years Earlier]

238
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,920
Go collect the debt in full.

239
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,480
Make sure you get all the money.

240
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Understand?

241
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Yes, boss.

242
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
How are we going to do this?

243
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,360
There are a lot of them here.

244
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,720
My fists are itching.

245
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,560
Don't.

246
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,840
The boss's ordered us to collect the debt.

247
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,240
Not to start a fight.

248
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,280
Come on.

249
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,480
If collecting the debt was easy, we'd already have it.

250
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,840
You shouldn't waste the energy here.

251
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
There.

252
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,200
Let's use the back door.

253
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,400
Trying to get away?

254
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,840
No.

255
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm not going anywhere.

256
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,240
Here.

257
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm preparing the money for your boss.

258
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,680
You can count to see if it's all in there.

259
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,440
So, how did you guys get in here?

260
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,350
I didn't know you were coming,

261
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,640
So I didn't go get you.

262
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,880
Don't worry.

263
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,560
The staff opened the door for us,

264
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,120
the door's still fine.

265
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,760
That's all of it.

266
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,160
When you work with us,

267
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,680
keep in track of the time.

268
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Shit!

269
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,720
Why did you bring him with you?

270
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,440
He saved my life, boss.

271
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,130
Saved your life, that's it?

272
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,410
How pointless.

273
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,600
He might need someone to depend on.

274
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,490
If he stays there from now on, he'll surely die.

275
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,170
Now that you've recovered, get out.

276
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,240
Perhaps you could let him work for us.

277
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
He has nowhere to go.

278
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,760
He could turn on his own boss.

279
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,960
What makes you think we can trust him, Tew?

280
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,440
Maybe he's been oppressed so much.

281
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,960
Otherwise, he wouldn't have done it.

282
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,160
I would never betray anyone again.

283
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,840
I promise.

284
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,720
I'll be your loyal men.

285
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,200
I'll be faithful.

286
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,720
Please help me.

287
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,520
Then it's up to you.

288
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,240
Remember what you've said, alright?

289
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,170
[You couldn't kill me that easily, Tew!]

290
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Tew.

291
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
Where are you?

292
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,160
Sorry for not being there until you wake up.

293
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,560
Where did he go?

294
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,520
[I feel better now, Where are you?]

295
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,760
[I feel better now, Where are you?] (Unread)

296
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,200
Hey, Guy!

297
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,440
Why're you staring at my face like that?

298
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
Something's on my face?

299
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Tell me.

300
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
No, no.

301
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm just...

302
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
staring.

303
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,360
Have you eaten yet?

304
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
No.

305
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,880
Great.

306
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,400
Then let's go eat at Uncle Dum's.

307
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,330
Here, the strawberry smoothie that you like.

308
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,320
Thanks.

309
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
No problem.

310
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,040
Aren't you mad at me anymore?

311
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,560
What did I have to be upset about?

312
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,680
Things that I said the other day...

313
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,040
You're my best friend.

314
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,560
How could I be mad at you.

315
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Both of us

316
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,080
are still besties, right?

317
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,160
Umm.

318
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,840
That's all there is to it.

319
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,320
You're overthinking.

320
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,720
Let's take a picture together.

321
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,600
We haven't taken a picture together in a while.

322
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,640
This angle doesn't seem good at all.

323
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,760
It's not?

324
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,800
But I look handsome in this angle.

325
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,880
No, change the angle.

326
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,570
How about this side.

327
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,900
Better?

328
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,010
This angle's alright.

329
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,390
You look fine but I don't in this angle.

330
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,440
Just take it.

331
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,920
Come.

332
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Smile too.

333
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
One, two, three.

334
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Alright?

335
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,120
Wanna take a boat back to the apartment today?

336
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
What mood are you in.

337
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,440
Well, to feel the chilly breeze.

338
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,640
[Die!]

339
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,600
You came all the way here.

340
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,080
Apologies

341
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,120
for not being there to welcome you.

342
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,560
How do you know I'm here?

343
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,760
You're good at this, right?

344
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,480
Find me.

345
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,760
Even a petty guy like me

346
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,560
still found your secret room.

347
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,040
I'm going to find you for sure.

348
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,480
This time I won't let you live.

349
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,040
Are you afraid I'll do something bad to your lover?

350
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,170
I'll do it.

351
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,960
I'll make the people who've entered your life hurt,

352
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,360
Suffer,

353
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,640
Until they beg to die.

354
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,480
Fuck you.

355
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,930
You know what I'm capable of.

356
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,760
Nothing we've studied got through my head.

357
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,160
Did you manage to write it down?

358
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
I did.

359
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,240
Then,

360
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
can I borrow yours to copy later?

361
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Oh.

362
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,880
There are lots of new movies coming today.

363
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,520
Wanna go watch one of them?

364
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,530
I'm kinda busy.

365
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,960
I need to go check the restaurant.

366
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,600
Sorry.

367
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,970
Check the restaurant?

368
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,050
What restaurant?

369
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,280
Well,

370
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,640
Tew's going to open a new shabu place.

371
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,000
It's near the university.

372
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,840
The place will be open soon

373
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,560
so things are a little messy.

374
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,800
So... I'm going to give them a hand.

375
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,200
Preparing stuff, something like that.

376
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Then, would you like me to help you too?

377
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,280
You're fine with Tew now?

378
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,280
I've never had a bad feeling about him.

379
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm going to be honest.

380
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm worried that if you go there,

381
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,320
You and Tew,

382
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,360
One of you will fight each other at some point.

383
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,400
You shouldn't come.

384
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,480
I'm warning you for your own sake.

385
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,320
Okay.

386
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,520
It's alright.

387
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,730
I understand.

388
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,640
I won't be you and Tew's third wheel.

389
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,600
But I wanted to let you know that

390
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,680
No matter what happens,

391
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,920
I'll always be there for you around the clock.

392
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,520
I know.

393
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,320
Then, I'll get going now.

394
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,880
[Business for Sale]

395
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,639
Business for sale?

396
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,840
What sale?

397
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,520
What's going on?

398
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,480
Why do you have to sell this place?

399
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,090
Is there something wrong?

400
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,050
Or your boss doesn't quit?

401
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Guy.

402
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,890
Let's break up.

403
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,920
Why are you doing this?

404
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
Why?

405
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,240
We can't be together any further.

406
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,520
Leave now.

407
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,560
No!

408
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm not breaking up with you.

409
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
If you're not leaving

410
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
then I will.

411
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,800
What's wrong with you?

412
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,090
Why are you suddenly treating me this way?

413
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,520
You're going to leave me this easily?

414
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,720
We've been through so much.

415
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,000
You still don't realize I want to be with you?

416
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,720
We can't be together.

417
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,280
It's too dangerous.

418
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,720
What else is dangerous?

419
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,480
Your boss didn't bother you anymore, right?

420
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,280
And the guy who kidnapped me.

421
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,880
Isn't he already dead?

422
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,880
What about what you've said you'd protect me

423
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,600
and stay by my side?

424
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,880
Weren't we going to run this place together?

425
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,280
That's why you asked me to help.

426
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,080
I can't live without you.

427
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,000
Let go, Guy.

428
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I can't...

429
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,240
Let go.

430
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,120
Enough, Guy!

431
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,680
I talked to you nicely and you didn't listen.

432
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,800
Then I'll just speak the truth.

433
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,880
All these time, I was only satisfied with you.

434
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,840
Would've been nice to have my way with you once,

435
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,760
and I already had.

436
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,530
No.

437
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,400
You're lying.

438
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,160
If you didn't care about me,

439
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,280
Why did you have to come and save me?

440
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
I wanted revenge on Kenji from the beginning.

441
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,810
You just happened to get involved.

442
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,720
Get the hell out of my restaurant.

443
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Tew.

444
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Goddamn it.

445
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,640
Get the fuck out of my place!

446
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,280
Get out!

447
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,120
Sorry that I have to do this, Guy.

448
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Kenji.

449
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,640
Here, let me help you.

450
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,800
Excuse me.

451
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,840
I've sent Tew the message.

452
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
I know.

453
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Come closer.

454
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,400
I have a gift for you.

455
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,960
A prize for your mistake.

456
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,240
How could you let them get out alive?

457
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,800
Huh?

458
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,600
I'm so sorry.

459
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,200
Just wait until I recovered.

460
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,440
I'll go back for his loved ones,

461
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,840
and slaughter them all!

462
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,960
Kenji.

463
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,040
Please stop messing with Tew.

464
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,400
He's not with the boss anymore.

465
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,960
He has no power.

466
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,880
Nobody can dethrone you now.

467
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,320
You think so?

468
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,440
Do you think someone like the boss

469
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,600
Could lose his right-hand man like Tew?

470
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Go!

471
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,320
Why the hell do you keep standing?

472
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Go!

473
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,760
Did you actually forget...

474
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,600
What today is?

475
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,080
Our anniversary, right?

476
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,280
It's my birthday.

477
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,640
My birthday that you've never cared to remember.

478
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,680
Nami.

479
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,520
I've had a lot to do lately,

480
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,120
that's why I really couldn't remember.

481
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,840
Many things you've done

482
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,720
are related to Guy.

483
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,800
Everyday, in the morning,

484
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,000
you went to see Guy

485
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,160
and spent all of your time with him.

486
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,360
You treated me like I wasn't your girlfriend.

487
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,040
Well, I...

488
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,600
If you are going to say "sorry,"

489
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,170
I don't want to hear it from you.

490
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,680
I think I've had enough.

491
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,200
Let's break up.

492
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,910
Nami

493
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,280
If you don't have the feelings for me.

494
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,970
then stop forcing yourself.

495
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,090
Also, never do this to anyone else again.

496
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,430
(In time that you are here)

497
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,690
(I am so grateful)

498
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,040
(It's warm and so gentle)

499
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,360
(Happiness in my heart)

500
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,740
(But it’s just yesterday,)

501
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,260
(Love is a delusion)

502
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,810
(It changed, The time is spinning)

503
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,440
(Here it comes today,)

504
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,070
(As he came into)

505
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,200
(He held all over my heart)

506
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,690
(It’s like he used to it)

507
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,010
(Now it’s so intense,)

508
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,450
(Cause I know he’s the one)

509
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:42,080
(But there’s another one, Who I still love)

510
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,700
How did you get here?

511
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,410
I thought you'd be here.

512
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,320
You've been standing here for so long

513
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,280
Why didn't you call me?

514
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,520
I'm giving time to be with yourself

515
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,480
until you're ready to step out of there.

516
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:59,500
(Now it’s time to choose, For my heart)

517
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,890
(Please tell me what I should do)

518
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,840
(What if I choose him,...)

519
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,960
It's okay.

520
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm right here.

521
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,170
(Will he break my heart?)

522
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,220
(Please listen to me, My heart)

523
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:18,610
(I can’t stand hurting anyone)

524
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,330
(It is too hard, What should I do?)

525
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,760
(What if to do?)

526
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,730
(It is too hard,)

527
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,250
(Please tell me,...)

528
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,070
(What to do?)
