1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,960
Where the hell are you, Boss?

2
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,320
Should we go look for Mr.Tew at his condominium?

3
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Tew's condominium is his privacy space.

4
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,970
Kenji.

5
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Where's your boss?

6
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
The boss's not here.

7
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,040
Chief Sun's pissed that he punched his son the other day.

8
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,960
He'll take action against him.

9
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
Harassed my employee,

10
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,230
then asked Daddy to go after us?

11
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,710
What an amatuer.

12
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,750
If your boss doesn't have the balls,

13
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,160
I'll go handle it myself.

14
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,910
The boss is busy today.

15
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,260
Tell the chief to come ask for trouble next time.

16
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,680
I'm not in the mood for your jokes.

17
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,560
If Tui.

18
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,920
No...Tew's not here.

19
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Tell him that

20
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,770
he owed me one this time.

21
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,800
Nobody asked for your help.

22
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,140
How did you count that as a favor?

23
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,160
A degenerate like you,

24
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,680
are not on the same level as I am.

25
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,420
Remember this.

26
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,760
Where am I?

27
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,510
You're up?

28
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,710
Where am I, Tew?

29
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,850
My room.

30
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
Your room?

31
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
And...

32
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,000
How did I end up here?

33
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
You were so wasted last night.

34
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Guy?

35
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Guy.

36
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's have a look at your phone,

37
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,680
In case you kept your home address.

38
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,400
A real piece of work, aren't you?

39
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,720
You'll need a lesson when you wake up.

40
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,880
At first, I thought I'd leave you at the restaurant

41
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
But I was worried you'd talk too much

42
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,550
and then get attacked by others.

43
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
Thanks a lot, Tew.

44
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,380
That you didn't left me behind

45
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,440
I can't really remember anything from yesterday.

46
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,760
I may have been drunk

47
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,120
from the second glass.

48
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,640
Judging by how drunk you were.

49
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,200
You hadn't been drinking much, right?

50
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Just admit it.

51
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,240
Yeah.

52
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Normally,

53
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,940
I'm not very good at drinking.

54
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,720
Are you still having a hangover?

55
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,440
Well, then

56
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,680
I'm going to cook some hangover food for you.

57
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Please wait.

58
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
Smells good.

59
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,820
Wow,

60
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,420
This looks really great, Tew.

61
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,640
Eat while it's still hot.

62
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,280
It'll help you get rid of your hangover.

63
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,310
I'll let you have the first bite.

64
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,310
Consider it to be the meal's cost.

65
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,850
I also have my own.

66
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,120
Come on, you.

67
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
The noodles are going to fall off.

68
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Eat this.

69
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Please eat.

70
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Guy.

71
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Do you like whales?

72
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,360
Wahl...

73
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,960
Why?

74
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,720
Last night, I heard you talking about
whales in your sleep many times.

75
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,500
Tew.

76
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,360
Technically, whales are not fish,

77
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,080
but rather mammals.

78
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,640
And what I was dreaming about

79
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,160
might not have had anything to do with the animal.

80
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
But...

81
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,080
instead, a person named after the whales.

82
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,980
A person named after the whales?

83
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,760
I don't get it.

84
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,740
Well.

85
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,200
I have a friend from the university,

86
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
his name is Whal.

87
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,360
But actually,

88
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
We've known each other since high school.

89
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,840
So we applied to the same university.

90
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,520
In the same faculty.

91
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
To wrap things up,

92
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,710
you dreamed about a friend named Wahl.

93
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,880
A best friend.

94
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,320
Well, So far

95
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,080
he's my only friend.

96
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,060
Think of him more than a friend, I see.

97
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,520
That was delicious, Tew.

98
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,640
I'll help you wash the dishes.

99
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
You don't have to.

100
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I'll take care of them.

101
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Tew.

102
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,360
What's the stain on your pants?

103
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Huh?

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,320
Let me help removing it.

105
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Thank you

106
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
for dropping me.

107
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,080
Anything else?

108
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Well...

109
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,640
I want to tell you that

110
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,000
you're very kind, Tew.

111
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,200
You've been taking care of me since last night.

112
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,170
Gave me a place to sleep,

113
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,520
cooked me some noodles too.

114
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,560
And also drove me to my apartment.

115
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
That was nothing at all.

116
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
I'm sorry,

117
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,130
If I ever did anything to upset you

118
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,920
or crossed the line.

119
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,240
It's okay.

120
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,760
I know you didn't mean it.

121
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
So about the meeting,

122
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,170
are you coming?

123
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,880
Let me think about it first.

124
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,520
I'll get going now.

125
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Okay.

126
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,640
Guy.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,360
I called you multiple times and you didn't answer.

128
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,210
My phone's battery ran out.

129
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,800
Sorry.

130
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,040
And where have you been?

131
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,920
Well...

132
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
I...

133
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,200
I was very drunk yesterday

134
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,320
and couldn't return to the room,

135
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,950
so I had to sleep at my friend's place.

136
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,400
Drunk?

137
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,360
You, a guy who didn't like drinking, were drunk?

138
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,150
And stayed at your friend's place?

139
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,240
Which friend?

140
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
You wouldn't know.

141
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,660
Tell me then,

142
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,000
So I can get to know him.

143
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,200
Well, he's one of my gaming friends.

144
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Are you

145
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
fine with that?

146
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,140
Of course not.

147
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Did you know?

148
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Guy!

149
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,680
that last night,

150
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,880
I'd spent the whole night looking for you.

151
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,600
I was worried that you might be in danger.

152
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,640
You only met him through the game,

153
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,400
but you got drunk and slept at his place.

154
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,850
Have you known him?

155
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,240
How could you trust him?

156
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,560
Even more, he's someone unknown to me.

157
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,400
Have you seen the news lately?

158
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,640
Many had been tricked into being murdered or robbed.

159
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,080
You couldn't just blindly trust anyone.

160
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,000
I've already grown up now.

161
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,400
I can take care of myself.

162
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,360
You don't have to know all of my friends, Wahl.

163
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
I have my own world too.

164
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,360
You're very kind.

165
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Guy?

166
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
You've been looking after me since last night,

167
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
gave me a place to sleep,

168
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
Wow!

169
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
This looks really great, Tew.

170
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,720
cooked me some noodles too.

171
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,240
I'll let you have the first bite.

172
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,510
What took you so long,

173
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,330
Where have you been, boss?

174
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
What's up?

175
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,160
Mr.Paiboon wants to meet you, right now.

176
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,170
I'm just worried about you, Guy.

177
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,830
What if your parents called me

178
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,120
and asked where you were,

179
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
What would I have to answer?

180
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,400
That's why I became worried.

181
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,240
But if you're still mad at me.

182
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,840
How was that?

183
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,280
Are you done being mad at me?

184
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,400
You always

185
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
did that move.

186
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,100
So we're good now.

187
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,360
Fine.

188
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm sorry.

189
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,920
Have you eaten yet?

190
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,320
Do you have classes in the afternoon?

191
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,620
You wanna come to my room and eat shabu?

192
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,440
You're coming?

193
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,720
You didn't give me a chance to respond.

194
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,360
Let me check

195
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,680
to see if I have any classes.

196
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,480
I don't have classes today.

197
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Alright.

198
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,900
But first, I have to go see Nami.

199
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,920
She told me a computer in her room is having a problem.

200
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,530
It's okay if you're busy.

201
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,220
What busy?

202
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,000
See you in the evening.

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,040
See ya.

204
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,569
Good afternoon, Mr.Tew.

205
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,160
Mr.Paiboon won't let you live.

206
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,110
The guy you whacked the other day,

207
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,370
he's Chief sun's son.

208
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Last night,

209
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,360
You'd gone missing.

210
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,610
I had to take the fall

211
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,880
and apologize to him on your behalf.

212
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,420
Keep that in your mind, Tew.

213
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
It was none of your business,

214
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,440
Why did you showed your face there?

215
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,660
Fuck you.

216
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Relax,

217
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,340
If you have something to say, speak nicely.

218
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,400
Were you aware of

219
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,980
who his parents are?

220
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
I was.

221
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,960
Even if you were aware, Why did you still do it ?

222
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,920
What happened in the Karaoke

223
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,200
was that they harassed our employee.

224
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
I simply warned them.

225
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I have proof from the bar's security cameras.

226
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,480
And for what happened after that

227
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,220
was that they were not done with me.

228
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,320
And they were the ones who started attacking me first.

229
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,560
I had no choice but to fight back.

230
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,960
I assure you,

231
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,980
what I said was the truth.

232
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,670
You fought back or you overreacted?

233
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,160
Because of your dumb actions,

234
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,960
The unlucky one who had to take the fall and get beaten

235
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,280
was me.

236
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,600
I was the one in pain,

237
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
I was the one who took the blame for you.

238
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,160
You had no goddamn responsibilities, Tew.

239
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,400
Why didn't you listen when I asked nicely.

240
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,240
You were nosy,

241
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,280
Why didn't you mind your own business?

242
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,000
Did I ask you to do anything?

243
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Sorry, sir.

244
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Tew.

245
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,280
Go apologize to Chief Sun.

246
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,240
I'll contact him

247
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
before you get there.

248
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,490
Yes, boss.

249
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Tew.

250
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,440
I'll get you for this.

251
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,720
What do I do now.

252
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
Should I tell him I've suddenly become sick?

253
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Hey, Guy!

254
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,150
How long have you been here?

255
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,840
Not that long.

256
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
Where are you walking to?

257
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,660
My room's right here.

258
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,440
Why did I walk here?

259
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,570
I'm taking out the trash,

260
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
one second.

261
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,160
Come, get in the room.

262
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Come on!

263
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
What's up?

264
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,190
Hi, Guy.

265
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Hi.

266
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,160
Can I help you with anything?

267
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,240
It's okay,

268
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,360
you so take a seat.

269
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,450
Wahl's help should be enough.

270
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,200
Wahl.

271
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Look at my nails.

272
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,760
- Are you hurt?
- I broke my nails.

273
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Is it hurt?

274
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,360
When you're done cleaning, I'll clip your nails.

275
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,200
You're the cutest.

276
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,120
Be careful when cutting, okay?

277
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Alright.

278
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,380
[So, how will the meeting go?..]

279
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,160
[..Will everyone be there?]

280
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,440
[Did you manage to invite Yuri?]

281
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
[Yes,..]

282
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
[..but Yuri..]

283
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,000
[..may not be a kind of person we expected.]

284
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
[Have you guys met?..]

285
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,520
[..Is she gorgeous?..]

286
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,940
[..Or is she a glasses girl..]

287
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,250
[..Give me a hint.]

288
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,010
[You old pervert.]

289
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,760
[I just want to know,..]

290
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,280
[..stop nitpicking me.]

291
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,080
[Idealize,..]

292
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,960
[..you must bring her here no matter what!]

293
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,360
[I'll try my best.]

294
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
[Knock-knock..]

295
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
[..What're you up to,..]

296
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
[..Hello?]

297
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,200
How was it, boss?

298
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,420
Was everything alright?

299
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Everything was fine.

300
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,190
Chief didn't say anything?

301
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
He didn't.

302
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,520
But he's terrifying most of the time, boss.

303
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
How did you even manage to survive?

304
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,060
Did you wish anything bad to happen to me?

305
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,120
It's not like that, boss.

306
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,520
I was afraid that you might be in trouble.

307
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,440
But if you're okay then everything's good.

308
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,440
Tew!

309
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,690
[Sorry, I was busy earlier..]

310
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,880
[..What is it?]

311
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,880
You're also on Kakao, boss?

312
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
[We're going to meet here.]

313
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,080
(Sends location)

314
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,390
[For tomorrow's event,..]

315
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,330
[..you said that you would think about it..]

316
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,800
[..Have you thought about it and decided to go?]

317
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,020
[I'll see you then..]

318
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,130
[..Because I'm sure that you'd want to see me.]

319
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,560
[You said it yourself.]

320
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,420
[Well, is it correct?]

321
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,120
[No,..]

322
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,440
[ ..I haven't decided yet.]

323
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
[Wah..]

324
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,120
[..Don't you want to see me?..]

325
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,600
[..I want to see you, you know?]

326
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,190
What's he smiling at?

327
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,210
Drive properly.

328
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes, boss.

329
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,480
[I'll tell you when I get home.]

330
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,280
[Someone's holding back..]

331
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,000
[..I'll be waiting.]

332
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,080
Are you hungry?

333
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,810
It's almost ready.

334
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Guy.

335
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,080
Guy!

336
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,080
What did you say?

337
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,960
I said, "Are you hungry?"

338
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm not that hungry.

339
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,880
Take your time.

340
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,440
Who are you texting?

341
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
My gaming friend.

342
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,680
Food is ready to eat.

343
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,320
Let me first wash my hands.

344
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Wahl.

345
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,240
We're out of sauce, so I'm going to go get some.

346
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
[I'm home.]

347
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,540
[And the answer is...]

348
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,610
[Alright, see you tomorrow.]

349
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,330
[Yay,..]

350
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,800
[..I'm going to bed now,..]

351
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,360
[..so tomorrow will come quickly.]

352
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
[You're exaggerating.]

353
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,960
[Goodnight you.]

354
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,520
[Goodnight.]

355
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,320
Sir.

356
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
It's burning.

357
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm waiting for my friend.

358
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Hang on.

359
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,320
[If you don't show up within five minutes..]

360
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,260
[..I'll start eating.]

361
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,600
I have arrived!

362
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I am...

363
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,800
Doctor Strange.

364
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,600
The guide's leader, The tanker, rusher, initiator.

365
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
The guy who always ranting.

366
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,680
The term "Doctor"

367
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,200
doesn't mean the repair of humans

368
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,560
or other living things

369
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,640
but rather electronic devices.

370
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,880
I thought he was Ronaldo.

371
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
That is P.Insomnia.

372
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,370
The second in command.

373
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,590
The carry hunter.

374
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,280
Eagle eyed, badass woman.

375
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,670
A straight forward person

376
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,540
much like bikers.

377
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,350
Sorry,

378
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,600
I came as fast as I could.

379
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,000
Hello.

380
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,120
That is Yaituatung.

381
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,680
The cute girl.

382
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,650
That will hype up her viewers

383
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,390
to start playing the game.

384
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,760
Hello everyone, Muffin's here.

385
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,360
A well-known streamer

386
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,570
who has millions of followers.

387
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Hiya.

388
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,580
And you are Idealize, right?

389
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
I am.

390
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,680
Please sit down.

391
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
Well, since we're already here.

392
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,160
I guess we don't have to call each other by game names.

393
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,200
My name's Pai.

394
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm Guy.

395
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Muffin's here.

396
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,480
I'm Tom.

397
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,880
Guy, Idealize.

398
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,480
The hag, P.Insomnia.

399
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,080
Muffin, Yaituatung.

400
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,370
What about Yuri?

401
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,520
Right,

402
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,920
where's Yuri?

403
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,640
I haven't seen him too.

404
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,120
Were you able to invite him?

405
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,360
I were.

406
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,160
Well, when I met Yuri,

407
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,240
the guy promised to come.

408
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,560
So what do you mean

409
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,520
when you said Yuri wasn't what we expected?

410
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,270
Oh, Yuri.

411
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,800
Actually, Yuri...

412
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
was a man.

413
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,880
A man?

414
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,160
Is he hot?

415
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
He's kinda hot.

416
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,970
I wanna meet him now.

417
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,800
You need to throw up?

418
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,360
There's another handsome guy right here,

419
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,240
If you didn't notice.

420
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
Just sit down.

421
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,790
When will you sit?

422
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,920
You guys actually fight,

423
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,790
both in-game and in real life.

424
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,200
Need to order here!

425
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,440
So how was he like.

426
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,880
Tell us the prologue.

427
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,900
When we first met.

428
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,100
He was...

429
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,920
a quiet guy.

430
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,740
He didn't speak much.

431
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,320
He was calm

432
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,280
and seemed like an adult.

433
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,880
If we didn't know him beforehand,

434
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,210
everyone may think he was arrogant.

435
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,320
But the reason why he was like that,

436
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,200
maybe he was

437
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,760
just nervous.

438
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,200
Because we never met before, something like that.

439
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,650
But Honestly,

440
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,160
He was quite a gentleman.

441
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
And what does he do for a living?

442
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
I'm not sure about that.

443
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
I hadn't dared to ask.

444
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,200
Acting mysteriously like that

445
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,080
makes me want to find out more about him.

446
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,240
By the way, when is he going be here?

447
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,760
I really want to meet him.

448
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,560
You described him so well that I want to meet him.

449
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,650
Then I'll ask him where he is.

450
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,280
[Where are you now.]

451
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,480
[Almost there.]

452
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,440
He said,

453
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,680
he's almost here.

454
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
That's all?

455
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yup.

456
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,520
Let us eat first, alright?

457
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,760
I'm hungry.

458
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,560
Go ahead.

459
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,840
We'll save some meat for you.

460
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,960
[I'm here.]

461
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,770
[You wait over there,..]

462
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,820
[..I'll go get you.]

463
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,340
He's here right now.

464
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,920
I'm going to get him.

465
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,930
See you.

466
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Tew.

467
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Guy.

468
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,860
Sorry, I was a bit late.

469
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,200
No problem at all.

470
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
They've just arrived here too.

471
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,360
Come, I'll take you to the table.

472
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Let's go.

473
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Everyone.

474
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,360
This is Yuri.

475
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,480
Yo!

476
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,000
Hello there.

477
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,440
Hi.

478
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,720
Or in other name,

479
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,050
Tew.

480
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Hello.

481
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Tew.

482
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,080
This is Tom, Doctor Strange.

483
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,880
And that's

484
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,880
Pai, P.Insomnia.

485
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,679
Little Muffin, Yaituatung.

486
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,400
You can sit next to me, Tew.

487
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,560
It's okay,

488
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,020
You can come sit next to me.

489
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,949
Sit on this one, Tew.

490
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,480
Well, since we're all here,

491
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,680
allow me to deliver an opening speech.

492
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Eat!

493
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,640
That's all you got, after a huge intro?

494
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Go on, Muffin.

495
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,200
Let's eat everyone.

496
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Eat up, don't hold back.

497
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,760
Don't have a plate yet, Tew?

498
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,560
I'll take care of that.

499
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Hello!

500
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,120
A set of plate, cutlery and chopsticks

501
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,220
for this handsome guy over here please!

502
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,920
Muffin.

503
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,600
Unwrap your tongue before you speak, girl.

504
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,200
What a bummer.

505
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,200
What's that?

506
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,680
A gift.

507
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,710
For me? Thank you so much!

508
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
It's for Guy.

509
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Mine?

510
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,560
You mentioned that you want to eat this.

511
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,780
When did I ever tell you?

512
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,680
When you were drunk last time.

513
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,680
Strawberry cake.

514
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Want some strawberry cake.

515
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Thank you.

516
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,160
You can remember.

517
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,020
This is embarassing.

518
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,400
You went out drinking too?

519
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,770
You're a real deal, Guy.

520
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,120
That's actually great.

521
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,840
Wanna have some drink?

522
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,400
So we won't be shy.

523
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,640
Five glasses of beer here!

524
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,920
Cheers!

525
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,160
Cheers!

526
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Close to what?

527
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,040
Close to being burned.

528
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,280
Cheers!

529
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,160
Cheers!

530
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,520
Slow down,

531
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,880
you'll end up like the other day.

532
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,080
It won't be like that again,

533
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,130
I really screwed up that day.

534
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,920
Are you drunk?

535
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,440
I'm not!

536
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,360
I'll show you, look.

537
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,000
Didn't fall.

538
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
Still didn't fall.

539
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,070
Want to go wash your face?

540
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,220
That will make you feel better.

541
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Feeling better now?

542
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,850
Much better now.

543
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,050
Thank you very much.

544
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,920
But...

545
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,930
I should get going.

546
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,400
I can go no further.

547
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Let's go, I'll drop you off.

548
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,920
I'm sorry everyone.

549
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
So drunk.

550
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,690
If I stay, I'll throw up.

551
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,030
Let's go.

552
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,740
Are you alright?

553
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm fine.

554
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,560
If you don't believe me,

555
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,300
I'll demonstrate by standing straight.

556
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,150
How about that?

557
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,480
You're fine, right?

558
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,440
I'm okay.

559
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Guy!

560
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,480
Why are you this drunk?

561
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,920
Did you intoxicate my friend?

562
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,730
[We're going to meet here.]
(Sends location)

563
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,810
[For tomorrow's event, you said that you would think about it.]

564
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:33,760
[Have you thought about it and decided to go?..]

565
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,950
[I'll see you then..]

566
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,170
[..Because I'm sure that you'd want to see me.]

567
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,170

571
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,560
[I'll tell you when I get home.]

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,520
