1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
How's that.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,120
You said you're fine, right?

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
I'm fine.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Guy!

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,760
Why are you this drunk?

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,080
Did you intoxicate my friend?

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,600
You're with this man again, Guy?

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Wahl.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,800
Oh, this one?

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,480
You know who I am?

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,880
I told him about you.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Told him?

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,680
What did you tell him?

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,910
I told him

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,280
You're my best friend.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
So.

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,519
Who is he?

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
He's that friend from the game.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
A friend you'd slept at his place the other day?

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,760
Wait.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,200
And you're drunk again today.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,920
Isn't it a little bit too much?

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
You intoxicated my friend, did you?

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,480
If you're planning something bad, stop.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,600
Wahl.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,160
Not one word, Guy.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,840
This happens twice in a row.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,360
He may not be that kind of person.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,680
And it wasn't only the two of us that came here.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,320
There are more people in the restaurant.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,960
You're too naive.

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,520
You're overly optimistic,

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,440
You have no idea what a scumbag is up to.

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,120
Called me a scumbag.

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,720
Do you know me?

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,200
I didn't say that you're a scumbag.

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,440
I was referring to other typical scumbags.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,680
That's enough, Wahl.

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,400
He's not a bad person.

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,120
Did you know him well enough?

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,200
How many times have you met him?

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,720
Who is he, what has he done,

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,920
What does he do for a living?

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,580
Did you know any of that?

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,520
Am I right?

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,630
That's why you shouldn't trust him yet.

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,780
This is my friend,

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
He's going home with me.

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Come.

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,920
Let's leave, guy.

51
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,180
Wait.

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,410
How will you get home?

53
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
By taxi.

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Guy.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,200
You should come with me, I'll drive you home.

56
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,440
How could that be better?

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,640
I don't even know who you are or where you're from.

58
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,480
Then let Guy decide

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,840
who he wants to go home with.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
I still haven't had enough today.

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,730
It would be great if we could

62
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,090
get together like this every day.

63
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,360
Muffin.

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,440
Aren't those Guy and Tew?

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,300
Something going on?

66
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,480
He's being pulled over and over.

67
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,520
Maybe they're playing Tug-of-War?

68
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,000
Tug-of-War your ass.

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,160
What should we do, Tom?

70
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Hey!

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,120
What are you guys playing?

72
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,320
Let go now,

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Both of you.

74
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,600
Who's this?

75
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Never seen him before.

76
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,760
This is Wahl,

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
my best friend.

78
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,080
You're Wahl?

79
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,670
Hi, I'm Muffin.

80
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,330
What's wrong with your tongue?

81
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
Teasin' me, sweetie?

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
My friend,

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,680
He already has a girlfriend.

84
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Muffin.

85
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,120
Hello, What's up Nami?

86
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,780
His babe's calling, girl.

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,880
I have to attend the project presentation?

88
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah,

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
I completly forgot.

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

91
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,840
I have to go now.

92
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,600
Get there safely.

93
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
I'll return by myself.

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Well that means

95
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,960
you can come with me now.

96
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,640
I don't think that's a good idea.

97
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm worried about the others.

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,240
They might say you can drive me home,

99
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,600
but not them.

100
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,040
No need to worry, Tew.

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
We can make our way home on our own.

102
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,560
Right?

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Alright, Tom.

104
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
This one is strange,

105
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
He leaves without saying anything.

106
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
Kind of like saving words.

107
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,880
Come everyone, let's go home!

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
I have my motorcycle.

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,280
Don't let me find out you're still drinking.

110
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
How, bout a little more?

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,680
One more can left.

112
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Let's go, Guy.

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Want some more?

114
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Actually,

115
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,320
It's okay if you want to go back with Tew.

116
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,480
You don't have to be having a hard time with us.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,320
Tom.

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,600
I'm not having a hard time.

119
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,080
It's actually fun to go home with you guys.

120
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,320
I only said that just to be polite.

121
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,400
Well,

122
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm going to tell you that

123
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,280
Tew seems interested in you.

124
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,840
Something like this can be noticed.

125
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,080
Right, Muffin?

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,080
I hate to think about that,

127
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
it makes me sad.

128
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,600
Well, That doesn't seem likely to me.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,080
Tew and I had met before,

130
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
that's why we talked more.

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
He's so cool.

132
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,950
So what's his job?

133
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,860
Have you found out yet?

134
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,440
What a mystery!

135
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,040
This makes me like him even more.

136
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,919
Anyway,

137
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,600
Don't trust or put your faith in him just yet.

138
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,700
There were many cases in which

139
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,020
people who had met online

140
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,200
fell victim to fraud.

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
My advice was well-intentioned

142
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,550
and if nothing bad happens, then that's great.

143
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,680
Taxi!

144
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,840
I'll be going now, Guy.

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,040
Moving on!

146
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Muffin.

147
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,640
I'll tell Pai.

148
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,880
Then keep it a secret from her, Guy.

149
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
Bye!

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Of course I'll tell her.

151
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
To Sukumwit, sir.

152
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,680
Moving on!

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,870
[You never cared about me..]

154
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,000
[..when I didn't have anyone,]

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,690
[But when you found out I had someone,..]

156
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,920
[..you suddenly cared.]

157
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,720
[What exactly did that mean?..]

158
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,910
[..Were you jealous,..]

159
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,190
[..or were you just possessive?]

160
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,680
Hold up, baby face.

161
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,560
Where do you think you're going?

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,480
That's a nice looking phone.

163
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,920
Can I have it?

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
What the hell?

165
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,320
You're not talking to me, What a jerk.

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
You can have this, please take it.

167
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,920
I don't want your phone anymore.

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,040
Now you're messing with me.

169
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
I'm so sorry.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Please...I'm so sorry.

171
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
Think you're tough?

172
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,680
Please don't!

173
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Hey!

174
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Are you alright?

175
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm sorry, sir.

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,040
I didn't know he's your friend.

177
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Tew.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,520
Can I

179
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,480
ask you something?

180
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,160
Sure, what is it?

181
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm sorry, I didn't know he's your friend.

182
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I'm not as scary as you think I am.

183
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Tew.

184
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
What do you do for a living?

185
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,800
Why were those people seemed so terrified of you?

186
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
I...

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,560
might just look scary.

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Not likely.

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
You're pretty good-looking.

190
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
Anyway, what do you do?

191
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,490
I run a business.

192
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,160
What kind of business.

193
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Well...

194
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
A casual business.

195
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
Salon?

196
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Restaurant?

197
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Spa?

198
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,320
- Massage?
- A restaurant.

199
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,440
What kind of food?

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Well...

201
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
Grilled meat, Shabu...

202
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Thai food, Japanese food,

203
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
- Korean...
- Shabu!

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,480
Shabu, really?

205
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,800
Where can I find it?

206
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,360
The next meeting can be
held at your restaurant.

207
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,840
My place isn't quite ready yet.

208
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,920
When everything is in order, I'll invite you.

209
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
What's wrong?

210
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Just a little thirsty.

211
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,800
Need a hand?

212
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
No thanks.

213
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Keep driving.

214
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Guy.

215
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Guy.

216
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,560
We've arrived.

217
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,520
Did I drool on your shirt?

218
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,000
Do you want me to wash it?

219
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,600
It's okay,

220
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,120
You didn't get
anything on my shirt.

221
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,080
I slept out like a baby.

222
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,840
It might be because of

223
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,600
the beer I drank at the BBQ.

224
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,720
Thank you, Tew.

225
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,320
for getting me home.

226
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,230
Sorry for troubling you.

227
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
Don't be sorry.

228
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,600
Because

229
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,280
we're friends now.

230
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,560
Well then,

231
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm going up to my room now.

232
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Okay.

233
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,400
Tul.

234
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,600
Go check out

235
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,890
if there are any Shabu businesses

236
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,930
for sale in this area.

237
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,270
I want it.

238
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,440
Take care of this for me.

239
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
Got cha, Boss.

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Is Tew

241
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
really running

242
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
a restuarant?

243
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,600
This place is in a great spot.

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,640
It's close to both the dorm

245
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,040
and the university.

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,920
Students will also be your consumers.

247
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,360
You can start the business now if you're ready.

248
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Okay.

249
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,730
Then, may I take pictures

250
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,080
of the place from inside and outside?

251
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,360
Go ahead, have a look.

252
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Wanna go inside?

253
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,200
It's too damn hot outside.

254
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Come on.

255
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
All done.

256
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Here,

257
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,840
These are the keys.

258
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,280
Call me if you need anything.

259
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,660
I'm out of here.

260
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,790
Thank you.

261
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,480
Good luck on the new business.

262
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,320
It's not even noon yet.

263
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,040
How did I fall?

264
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Fuck.

265
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Hello.

266
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,600
Who the hell are you?

267
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,040
How did you get in here?

268
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,840
I noticed the staff recruitment sign,

269
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,600
so I walked in.

270
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,510
But I saw that you were sleeping

271
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,830
and didn't want to wake you up.

272
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,000
Shit, I had been sleeping for three hours?

273
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Wait, sir.

274
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,360
Please, employ me first.

275
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,800
Can you come back another day?

276
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,320
Alright?

277
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,080
Make a deal with me first.

278
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,320
So I may start working on that

279
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,550
"another day" you mentioned.

280
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,640
Shit, my boss is calling me.

281
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,000
He's going to scold my ass for sure.

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Sir!

283
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm a hard working guy.

284
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,720
You can ask me to do anything.

285
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,160
I can light up the stove,

286
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,120
carry the food, everything you want.

287
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,280
Sir!

288
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Please!

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,280
What's the matter with you?

290
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
Okay, I hire you.

291
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,880
You're hired, alright?

292
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,920
Now let me go.

293
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,440
- Really?
- Let me go now.

294
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,840
You mean that?

295
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
For real?

296
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,520
Are you serious?

297
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,960
Get the hell out now, I'm closing this place.

298
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,200
Thank you so much.

299
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Thank you!

300
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
Thank you so much!

301
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Kenji.

302
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Kenji.

303
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,120
You should see this.

304
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
Looks like they wanted to buy this place

305
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
to start a business.

306
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,320
This place isn't in the area where

307
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,880
boss told him to be in charge of.

308
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,540
Did he think quitting the drug and

309
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,530
sex industries would be this easy?

310
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
I suspect he'll collect

311
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,960
the protection fee by himself.

312
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,140
Should we tell the boss?

313
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Not yet.

314
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,960
Send in the infiltrator.

315
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,640
Collect more evidence.

316
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,079
Come tell me if you know anything.

317
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,079
Go.

318
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Yes sir.

319
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Hey.

320
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,160
So, how did you get home last night?

321
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
I..

322
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,360
returned home with my friends.

323
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,840
You sure?

324
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,680
It wasn't like that guy brought you home, right?

325
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Nope.

326
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,560
Yesterday was your one-month anniversary day?

327
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,040
Oh, with Nami?

328
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah.

329
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,120
She invited me to watch the presentation.

330
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,530
I almost forgot.

331
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,120
Luckily, she didn't get mad.

332
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,560
[Tom: One game tonight at 8:00 P.M., get ready.]

333
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,200
[Pai: Okay, I've been wanting to curse people.]

334
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,560
[Muffin: Okay.]

335
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,450
Hey, you wanna go home with me this saturday?

336
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,240
My mom said she missed me.

337
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
[Okay.]

338
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,230
Guy.

339
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,230
[Guy: Okay, see you.]

340
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Guy!

341
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
What?

342
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,320
Well, I asked but you didn't answer.

343
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Sorry.

344
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,240
What did you say again?

345
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,640
I asked if you wanted to go home
with me this Saturday.

346
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,990
What is it?

347
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,120
Have you got something to do?

348
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
No.

349
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,160
I guess I have nothing to do.

350
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,560
Is there anything else?

351
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Nothing.

352
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,600
Tul, I didn't do it.

353
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,640
Didn't? You didn't?

354
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
You didn't?

355
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Enough.

356
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
Who ordered you to rig a boxing match?

357
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Mr.Tew.

358
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm very sorry, sir.

359
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,780
I made a mistake.

360
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,680
Please do not report this to Mr.Boon.

361
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Looks like you've truly regretted what you did.

362
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,560
Really?

363
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,800
Thank you so much!

364
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
In the next match,

365
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,480
I promise to fight

366
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,740
and then return your money back.

367
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
No.

368
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,880
You don't have to box for a while.

369
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
My arm!

370
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,620
If you want the boss to believe

371
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,210
you didn't rig the boxing match,

372
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,520
You must look injured.

373
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Tul.

374
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,180
Take him to the hospital.

375
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,870
Yes, boss.

376
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Get up.

377
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,880
I won't.

378
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,960
You wasted my time by making me change my shirt.

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,960
If the person waiting for me gets angry with me,

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,960
you'll be dead when you wake up.

381
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
You alright?

382
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Yes.

383
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Tul.

384
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
Are there extra shirts in the trunk?

385
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm here.

386
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,080
Tom: Only Tew is left, Tell him to come, fast.

387
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,280
Come on, it is time.

388
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,360
[Where are you, Tew..]

389
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,400
[..Everyone's waiting for you.]

390
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
[I'm in front of your apartment.]

391
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Guy.

392
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,920
You're not lying.

393
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,120
I brought you this.

394
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,640
You travelled all the way here

395
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,000
just to hand me this cake?

396
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,920
The last time we had a meeting

397
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,640
I hadn't seen you eat that much,

398
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,960
so I bought this for you.

399
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,720
Here, the whole box is all yours.

400
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Thanks.

401
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,280
Want to come eat in my room?

402
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,040
The group is waiting solely for you.

403
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Let's go.

404
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Your neck...

405
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
What happened?

406
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,160
Where did you get that from?

407
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,360
I don't know.

408
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Let's go.

409
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,880
Here comes the cake.

410
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Looks great, doesn't it?

411
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,720
Definitely, because I bought it myself.

412
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
It is time.

413
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,280
Everyone's waiting.

414
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,320
Come.

415
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,600
Tom: Go go go, ready up.

416
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Don't forget to eat.

417
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,040
Hey,

418
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,490
This is so good!

419
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,960
I knew you'd love it.

420
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,880
Tom: Help me, Tew!

421
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Alright.

422
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
You have some too, Tew.

423
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Not now.

424
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,760
Tew and Guy are playing pretty well together.

425
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,640
It's like they are sitting next to each other.

426
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,160
What about you?

427
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,720
Are you sitting next to Pai right now?

428
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,680
Absolutely not.

429
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,160
My room is chilly and the couch is comfy,

430
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,920
There's no way I'm entering his phone booth.

431
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,760
But if you don't know where to go, Tew,

432
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
You can come play in my room.

433
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,040
Strong wifi, RGB lighting,

434
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
Gaming chair, It's all in here.

435
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,000
Thanks.

436
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,040
But right now

437
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm playing in Guy's room.

438
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,080
Why did you have to tell them?

439
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
They might think...

440
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,720
Let everyone think what they want,

441
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,920
I don't care.

442
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,200
But if you think, then I'll care.

443
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,680
Hey, Heal me!

444
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,720
Yes, we won!

445
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Yes!

446
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
I think...

447
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,960
I should go do the dishes now.

448
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,280
You must love playing video games.

449
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,640
In real life,

450
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,720
I don't have many friends.

451
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,000
Playing video games is like

452
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,360
a break from the real world for me.

453
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,040
Placing the console here,

454
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,280
aren't you afraid it will fall?

455
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,520
It probably won't,

456
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,280
The chair is very sturdy.

457
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,030
What about you, Tew?

458
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
Why do you like playing video games?

459
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,530
I hadn't played video games

460
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,260
since I was in a school.

461
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,170
I'd just gotten back into playing video games

462
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,760
when I met you guys.

463
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
It was actually really good

464
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,320
to get back to playing video games.

465
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Right?

466
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,040
Plus, it helps ease the stress.

467
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,560
For me, it was great

468
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,820
because it led me to meet you.

469
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,080
[Tom: We were at out top form today..]

470
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,610
[..Now I can take you all to play..]

471
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,970
[..in the national e-sport selection competition..]

472
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,840
[..without getting embarrassed.]

473
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,160
[Pai: Everyone was doing good,..]

474
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,400
[..except for the leader.]

475
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,360
[Tom: Go on, keep insulting me..]

476
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,320
[..I'm not lowering myself to fight with you today..]

477
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,680
[..Cause I'm happy!]

478
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,280
[Pai: Who exactly was lowering themselves?]

479
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,680
[Tom : For the competition, we have to train harder..]

480
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,520
[..Every single day.]

481
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
[I'm available everyday..]

482
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,800
[..except this weekend..]

483
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,120
[..I planned to return home
in another province with a friend.]

484
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Hey!

485
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
How did this get here?

486
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,600
I think this friend of yours

487
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,400
is not a nice person.

488
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,720
He may not be the right person for you.

489
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,400
What's up with you?

490
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,520
Wahl is a good person.

491
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,240
He is the first friend of mine.

492
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,920
He has always looked out for me.

493
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,560
If he has been taking good care of you

494
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,280
then why are you this lonely?

495
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,640
So, does he know?

496
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Knows about what?

497
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,560
Knows that you like him.

498
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,080
What are you taking about?

499
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,520
Wahl is just my friend.

500
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,120
You can tell me the truth.

501
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,520
This is the truth!

502
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,160
Stop assuming you know better than me.

503
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,320
Okay.

504
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,960
I don't want to argue with you.

505
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,560
I'll leave now.

506
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,240
Tew, Wait.

507
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,560
Don't leave yet.

508
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm sorry.

509
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,000
What I said about how you knew more than I did.

510
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,440
Well...

511
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,510
Admitting that was not easy.

512
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,560
The feelings I have for Wahl.

513
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,780
I've been holding on to them

514
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,320
for who knows how long.

515
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,560
Kept them for so long until I was afraid.

516
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,480
So I had to hide them away.

517
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,980
Even now, I don't even know

518
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,880
what the hell I'm saying.

519
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,520
Everything you said earlier

520
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,760
was completly true.

521
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,040
I really do like him.

522
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,800
He probably never knew,

523
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,920
and I don't want him to find out too.

524
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,510
I'm willing to be a friend

525
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,160
who watches him fall in love

526
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,600
and be happy with someone he cares about.

527
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,960
That's all I want.

528
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
It's okay.

529
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,040
One day,

530
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,000
You may find a right person

531
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,680
who truly belongs to you.

532
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Thank you.

533
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
It's ugly.

534
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,680
Boss, why are you thinking so much?

535
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,600
All of these stuff are free,

536
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
they can save us some money.

537
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,040
Throw the away, I don't like them.

538
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
So...

539
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,760
What do you have in mind?

540
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,720
Tell me, I'll handle it.

541
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,840
This is how I like it.

542
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,200
Got it, boss.

543
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,120
Thanks a lot

544
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,350
for helping me manage.

545
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Who is that?

546
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,240
What's going on between them?

547
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,600
Good afternoon, sir.

548
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Here he comes again.

549
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
I have to come

550
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
since I'm now an employee here.

551
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,160
You hired me yourself.

552
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,120
are you going to go back on your words?

553
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,240
Yeah, I hired you.

554
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,060
But the place is closed today,

555
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,680
so why did you come?

556
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,010
Because you had hired me

557
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,690
without interviewing me or anything.

558
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,880
That was kinda strange in my opinion.

559
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,440
Do I have to interview you?

560
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,670
Of course you have to.

561
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
In case I want to know anything
then I'll be able to ask you.

562
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,680
It's the interviewee's rights, you know?

563
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,960
Fine, whatever.

564
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,950
So, how do an interview works?

565
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,880
Give me a try.

566
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,600
Starting with me introducing myself.

567
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,440
My name is Boss,
I've recently graduated.

568
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,920
- What's your name?
- Tul.

569
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,480
Hello again, Tul.

570
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I'm Boss.

571
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,970
I'll give you a quick rundown of my story.

572
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,520
My dad had left me when I was a child

573
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,680
and my mom had been raising me all by herself.

574
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,440
I also have a sister,

575
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,160
she still hasn't graduated yet.

576
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,680
So I had to quickly get a job.

577
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,760
and I was lucky that I had met you.

578
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,990
Thank you for letting me have this job.

579
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,290
Now that you've told me that much,

580
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,560
I have no more questions.

581
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,200
In the end, I'll have to hire you anyway.

582
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,240
Then, it's my turn to interview you.

583
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,960
Do interviews usually go like this?

584
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
They do.

585
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
The first question is simple.

586
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

587
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,120
How is that even relevant?

588
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,080
It is relevant.

589
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,200
The status of the employer

590
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,040
is very important for a productive working.

591
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,880
Now answer me, Do you have a boyfriend?

592
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I don't.

593
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,160
Then who was that man from earlier.

594
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
Wasn't he your boyfriend?

595
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,480
You idiot,

596
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
That man was my boss.

597
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,800
What were you thinking?

598
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,200
It's a good thing that you're single

599
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,840
because it encourages me to work harder.

600
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,160
One more thing before we start working.

601
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,320
Now that you're the manager and I'm an employee.

602
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,360
Calling each other not by names isn't professional.

603
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,160
You should call yourself "P.Tul".

604
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,000
And you should call me "Boss" or "Nong Boss".

605
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,440
You're okay with that?

606
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,600
Is that so?

607
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,880
Seems like you don't know much about this sort of work.

608
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,920
Is this your first time running a restaurant?

609
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,240
I could tell right away.

610
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,440
Everything I told you is truthful.

611
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,560
You should make that a habit,

612
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,160
so the employees don't sue you.

613
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,240
I really mean well.

614
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,080
Alright, deal.

615
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Tew?

616
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,880
What are you doing here?

617
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,920
I want to send you home.

618
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,550
You're returning to other province, right?

619
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,680
I'll be fine.

620
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
I can go back on my own.

621
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
I want to go send you.

622
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Our lives are uncertain,

623
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,560
we never know when we will last meet.

624
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
I don't want to regret

625
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,920
that I didn't come to see you.

626
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
You're...

627
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,760
taking life very seriously.

628
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,920
Have you gone through anything bad

629
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,960
that's making you think this way?

630
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,800
You can tell me about it.

631
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,600
It doesn't matter.

632
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,920
What matters is that

633
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,739
I can do what I want together..

634
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,820
with you, and that's enough.

635
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm glad you came here to see me.

636
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
But it's fine, really.

637
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,960
I can go back by myself.

638
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
I'll be there for just a few days.

639
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,679
Alright,

640
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,840
I'm not going to force you.

641
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Here, this is my business card.

642
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,199
In case you happen to be free

643
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,520
and want to try the food.

644
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,480
Thanks.

645
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,960
I have to go now, my friend is waiting.

646
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,000
Have you been waiting long?

647
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
[Tell me when you get there.]

648
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,240
You called him here?

649
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,040
I didn't.

650
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,040
He just happened to be running errands around here.

651
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,440
Or did he stalk you here?

652
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,680
He seemed suspicious.

653
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,240
You're overeacting.

654
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,120
Who am I to be stalked by him?

655
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,480
This is his buisness card.

656
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,240
He has a real identity.

657
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,520
Look, he runs a restuarant.

658
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,420
You need to stop being paranoid about him.

659
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,800
Boss.

660
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
After you finish sweeping, start mopping next.

661
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Okay, Tul.

662
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Oh, Boss.

663
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Hello, Sir.

664
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,760
Sir, this is Boss,

665
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,320
Our new employee.

666
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Hello, Mr.Tew.

667
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,800
He's still not home yet?

668
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
What was that, Boss?

669
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Nothing.

670
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,950
[I've arrived home.]

671
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,400
Eat now,

672
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,880
The noodles are about to fall.

673
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
I'm down bad.

674
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,840
[What are you up to, Guy?]

675
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,390
[Are you alright Guy?..]

676
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,350
[..Did I do something that upset you?]

677
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,360
[We will talk when I get back.]

678
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Why am I drawn to this young man?

679
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,920
It could be because he's not scared of me,

680
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,320
and also never follows my order like anyone else.

681
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Tul.

682
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Tul.

683
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Tul!

684
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Oh.

685
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,920
You're here early, boss.

686
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,520
Some of the interior items are still missing.

687
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,920
They'll arrive in the next couple of days.

688
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,080
Normally, when people have something to say

689
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,760
they can text chat about anything, right?

690
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
Well, yeah.

691
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,980
But if it was an emergency, then we'd call.

692
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Then...

693
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,880
What kinds of things

694
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
can't be texted

695
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,590
and can't be called to talk about

696
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,480
and must be discussed in person?

697
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Well, well, well.

698
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,040
What exactly are you trying to ask me?

699
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,200
Who makes you anxious?

700
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,520
No one!

701
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,640
I was just trying to make a conversation.

702
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,480
Stuttering like this,

703
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm sure there is.

704
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,120
Who is it, boss?

705
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
Is it Guy?

706
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,560
Come here,

707
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
What, boss?

708
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,480
Boss!

709
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,760
When you're feeling shy,
you always use force to cover up.

710
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,200
I know, boss.

711
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
Other than me,

712
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,120
there's no one else you can talk to.

713
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,000
Because you've always known so much,

714
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,480
I don't want to say anything.

715
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,360
Okay, boss.

716
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm serious now,

717
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
No more teasing.

718
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,840
What did he tell you?

719
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,160
Be honest with me,

720
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,880
so I can give you the right answer.

721
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,920
He seems to be ignoring me.

722
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,440
And he also told me that

723
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
he'll talk to me when he gets back.

724
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,000
What could it be?

725
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Asking to be your boyfriend.

726
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
You dick!

727
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,840
And you said you wouldn't tease me.

728
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,000
I want an answer, not a joke.

729
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,400
When will he come back, boss?

730
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Tomorrow.

731
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
Boss.

732
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,000
I gotta be honest with you.

733
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
Your mind is agitating right now.

734
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,440
It's only one day,

735
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
just wait a little more.

736
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,720
You sure have a problem.

737
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,050
Well, it's because no one has ever

738
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,420
said to me like that before.

739
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,880
Obviously, boss.

740
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,920
You always put up your fangs to everyone.

741
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,840
Who in their right mind would dare to upset you?

742
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,920
But when it was Guy,

743
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,520
you flashed your teeth and smiled.

744
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,320
The kid wouldn't be scared of you, boss.

745
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,160
You've teased me a lot.

746
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,360
I guess

747
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,760
I didn't show you enough of my fangs.

748
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,080
Once in a while.

749
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,350
Please let me.

750
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
What the hell, Boss?

751
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,400
Have you been eavesdropping?

752
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
Yeah.

753
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,160
You said there was nothing going on between you two.

754
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Why did the tickle happen?

755
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,560
I was just messing with the boss,

756
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,650
nothing was going on.

757
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,360
Don't let me find out later

758
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
or I'll smack you.

759
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,520
Who're you going to smack, huh?

760
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,000
It'll be me who smacks you.

761
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,800
Please don't hit me, baby.

762
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Guy.

763
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,000
I thought you said you'd be back tomorrow.

764
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,560
Why didn't you let me know when you got back

765
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,560
so I could pick you up?

766
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,720
Or did your phone battery die?

767
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,280
Is it hot out here? Are you tired?

768
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Are you alright?

769
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,280
Now, we're seeing each other.

770
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,320
Can you tell me

771
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,520
what's going on with you?

772
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
I'm all right.

773
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
But you...

774
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,600
Who exactly are you?

775
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,000
Well, I am me.

776
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,880
Aren't you part of the mafia gang?

777
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,880
I didn't trust this friend of yours.

778
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,040
so I looked up his name on the business card.

779
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,960
I'm worried about you,

780
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,040
and I don't want you
to meet this kind of guy.

781
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,320
Was the man in this video...

782
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,840
really you?

783
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,400
Why were you hiding it from me?

784
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,640
For what, what's the point?

785
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,240
Do you really want to know...

786
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,640
Who I truly am?

787
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,600
Do you really wanna know?
