1
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,680
Are you sure about this, Guy?

2
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
Are you hurt?

3
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,160
I'm so happy.

4
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,520
How about you, Guy?

5
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Mm-hmm.

6
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,960
Just "Mm-hmm" ?

7
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Do you want me to say anything else at this point?

8
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,380
The scars on your body...

9
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,570
How did you get them?

10
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,120
Why would you want to know that?

11
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm just curious about it.

12
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,079
Most of them

13
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,480
came from when I worked.

14
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,640
This one right here.

15
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,400
Cleared things out with the other gang

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,160
about uneven profit distribution.

17
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Meant to talk to them nicely

18
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,630
but was responded with a knife.

19
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,440
And right there.

20
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,570
I got shot.

21
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,880
A man in uniform attacked me.

22
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,150
Was pretty terrible.

23
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,380
And over here...

24
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,190
That's enough, Tew.

25
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,160
Please stop telling me more.

26
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,680
You had to be really hurt.

27
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
It doesn't hurt at all now.

28
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,160
You've already promised

29
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,560
not to get into problems like this again.

30
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,160
When you said you'd quit

31
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,279
You meant it, right?

32
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,149
You promised?

33
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,810
I promised.

34
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,240
I'm planning to get out and live a normal life.

35
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,720
I'd like to open a restaurant

36
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,200
with you helping me

37
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
and be by my side.

38
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Are you okay with that?

39
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Okay.

40
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,060
Will your family be mad for coming home so late?

41
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,550
I'm all grown up, you know?

42
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,200
And I had already called to let them know.

43
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,310
What did you tell them?

44
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,480
That I stayed the night at my friend's.

45
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,450
You friend's?

46
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,120
Do you want me to tell them the truth

47
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,960
that we went and did something together?

48
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,680
What is "something" referring to?

49
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,840
Tew!

50
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Guy!

51
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,530
(As when our eyes meet every time,)

52
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,070
(I have seen you and myself in there)

53
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,500
(As when your smile captured my heart,)

54
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,010
(From the day that we first met. I’ve falling for you)

55
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,130
(Your smile has healed and calm the heart,)

56
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,400
(From things that crashing down the heart)

57
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,050
(The answer that my heart will only need,)

58
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,280
(It is you. Only you and always you)

59
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,790
(Could not trade for the world)

60
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,830
(With the best thing I have cherish right now)

61
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,990
(And it is you)

62
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,520
(Have never seen no one)

63
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,780
(That’s the best thing that came across me and my heart.)

64
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,470
(What should we call it...)

65
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,990
(The place where it’s only ours.)

66
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,040
(The place where it’s you and me)

67
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,030
(From now and ever)

68
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,900
(The place where we leave our tears and wounds)

69
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,640
(Cause it is our area)

70
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,100
(And I)

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Where have you been last night?

72
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,880
I called you many times but you weren't answering.

73
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,540
And you told your parents

74
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,080
that you were staying at my house.

75
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,800
I almost couldn't answer their questions.

76
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,970
There's probably just one friend

77
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,200
you could claim to be staying at his house,

78
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,720
And that's me.

79
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,560
Couldn't have been anybody else.

80
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Right?

81
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,890
How did you know I got back home?

82
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,370
I'm your friend, Guy.

83
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,240
I knew you wouldn't go anywhere far.

84
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,400
But what I didn't understand

85
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,310
was how you could dare to lie

86
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,480
to your parents these days.

87
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Wahl.

88
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
You know what?

89
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,720
Since you've known this guy

90
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,000
You've changed a lot.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,720
You don't seem like yourself anymore.

92
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,679
Wahl.

93
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,470
Come talk with me.

94
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Was I right

95
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,040
that he had changed you?

96
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,400
Listen to me, Wahl.

97
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,080
I admit that I've changed.

98
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,360
I used to be insecure

99
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,160
and had no friends

100
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,830
until I met you.

101
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,060
You were the friend that I cared about the most.

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,590
I tried to do the things you like.

103
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Applied to the same university as you.

104
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,640
Attempted to fit in with your friends.

105
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,910
Do you know why?

106
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,640
Because you told me

107
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,840
I would always be your first choice.

108
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,400
I've been holding onto your words for so long.

109
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,630
So long that I'm becoming tired of them too.

110
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,550
I want to have my own life

111
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,700
and someone that truly understand who I am.

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,480
Do you mean...

113
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,240
It's just as you think.

114
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,720
I've agreed to be Tew's boyfriend.

115
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,920
(I've agreed to be Tew's boyfriend.)

116
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,840
Why the hell do I have to be this upset?

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Looks good!

118
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll let you try first.

119
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Try it.

120
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,320
You still haven't told me about

121
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,880
about what you talked to him.

122
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,680
I've already cleared things up with him.

123
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sure he got it.

124
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,670
Did he really get it?

125
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,040
He gave off the impression of being upset.

126
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,920
I told him that...

127
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm in a relationship with you now.

128
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
It's my life,

129
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,780
I'm in charge of my own choices.

130
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,640
Whatcha smiling at?

131
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,080
You're brave these days.

132
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
Well, now that I'm your boyfriend,

133
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,200
I have to be bold and fearless.

134
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,400
Good, I like that.

135
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,450
Guy.

136
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,680
Can I have one item that's yours, Guy?

137
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
Which one do you want?

138
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,080
Anything.

139
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll go talk to my boss after this.

140
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,520
I need it for encouragement.

141
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,160
Is this one okay?

142
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,480
But I haven't washed it yet.

143
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,480
No worries.

144
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Because it has your scent.

145
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,610
Thanks.

146
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,170
I'm rooting for you.

147
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
Hey!

148
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,270
What are you doing?

149
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,250
A kiss goodbye.

150
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,470
Right here?

151
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,240
I thought you said you have to

152
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,890
be bold to be my boyfriend.

153
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,720
Are you chicken out now?

154
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,440
Be brave.

155
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Did you have to bite me?

156
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
I'll be back for you.

157
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Boss.

158
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,800
Tew has something to discuss with you.

159
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Let him in.

160
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,840
Have you done something wrong?

161
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,220
Tell me about it.

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,240
I'd like to resign.

163
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,270
What's that supposed to mean?

164
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,800
I no longer want to work here.

165
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,840
I want to do something else that's an honest work.

166
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,080
And what would you like to do, Tew?

167
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,960
The new restaurant that's about to open.

168
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,520
To be honest,

169
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,840
I wanted to make it legitimate.

170
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,290
But the other day,

171
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,810
You didn't say that to me.

172
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
This location

173
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,480
is not in our domain.

174
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,200
What were you thinking when you did this?

175
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,240
Do you want to leave me?

176
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,420
I've never thought of anything like that, boss.

177
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,900
Have you forgotten about our rules?

178
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,680
No, not at all, boss.

179
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,800
All this time,

180
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,810
You've been raising me,

181
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,590
Giving me food, and water,

182
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,040
and giving me a new life.

183
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,600
I never thought about being ungrateful

184
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
or betraying you.

185
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,640
But now,

186
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,240
I just want stop.

187
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,520
You're in love, right?

188
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,840
Are you sure about quitting?

189
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
I am.

190
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Follow me,

191
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,680
I have one last gift for you.

192
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,680
Return your gun to me.

193
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
This round,

194
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
for your lies.

195
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
This round,

196
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,360
for the life debt that I extended for you.

197
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,860
This round,

198
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,640
to let you know that

199
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,600
You've made a wrong decision.

200
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,960
And one more round,

201
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,600
for my satisfaction

202
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,370
to see a traitor die in front of me.

203
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,520
All this time, you've been raising,

204
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,160
and giving me a new life

205
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
You’ve got the balls,

206
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,920
I like that.

207
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Wanna come work for me?

208
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Once you pick up a gun,

209
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,720
You cannot go back to being an ordinary person.

210
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
Working for me,

211
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,440
You must not lie to me.

212
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,200
When you said you'd quit

213
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
You meant it, right?

214
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Dad!

215
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
I never plan on going back to normal life anyway.

216
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,710
You're still as lucky as ever.

217
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
You can go now.

218
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Go wherever you want to

219
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,080
and never show me your face ever again.

220
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,040
Thank you for everything

221
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,240
You've compassionately done for me all this time.

222
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,280
After you leave this room...

223
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
You will no longer be part of my family.

224
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,120
Remember that.

225
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
You know it's the rule.

226
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,740
But I can't promise what condition

227
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,200
You'll be getting out in.

228
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm planning to get out and live a normal life.

229
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,360
I'd like to open a restaurant

230
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,880
with you helping me

231
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
and be by my side.

232
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,440
I'll be back for you, Guy.

233
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,360
You promised?

234
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
Hey, Tony!

235
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,960
You'll die if you get in like that!

236
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,060
Wait for your teammates first.

237
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,140
This is bad.

238
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,560
Fuck this, I'm not playing!

239
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Tom!

240
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,640
Last.

241
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,480
Last!

242
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm furious.

243
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,160
Hot!

244
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,320
I thought you said that grilled pork would fix everything.

245
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
You should've blown first.

246
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,680
I've blown and it's still fucking hot!

247
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,960
Nobody was playing well.

248
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,600
What a bunch of noobs.

249
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Muffin.

250
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
I miss Guy and Tew.

251
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,960
Should we try inviting them in again?

252
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,170
Let's see if he joins.

253
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,360
Who's gonna invite him then?

254
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,590
The hag?

255
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,840
Voices too cracked, so no.

256
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,000
Muffin.

257
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,590
Way too playful.

258
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,660
You're the one doing it, Tom.

259
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,240
Raises your hand to vote.

260
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,590
You.

261
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,480
What a bunch of communist scumbags!

262
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,880
Two out of three votes were communist?

263
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,310
Whatever, I'll invite him.

264
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,720
Tew?

265
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,790
[Hello, Guy...]

266
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,760
[...Wanna enter the game? I miss you.]

267
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,000
[Sure, I'm free right now.]

268
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,160
Hey, Guy's free and going play with us.

269
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,880
Enter the game, then.

270
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,000
Tell him to invite Tew too.

271
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,400
Okay, okay.

272
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,790
[You should also ask Tew...]

273
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,840
[...to play so that our team is full.]

274
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,600
[Not sure if he can play or not..]

275
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,000
[..I'm also waiting for him right now.]

276
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Tew?

277
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Guy.

278
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,560
I've finally broken free.

279
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,280
Hey, Tew!

280
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
Guy didn't hit the accept.

281
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,720
What the hell have you done?

282
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,840
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

283
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
We're going to lose our points again for sure.

284
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,240
Goddamnit.

285
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,080
You grill it now, do it.

286
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,680
Muffin's so sad.

287
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,450
Muffin!

288
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Just a little bit.

289
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
You...

290
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,720
What happened to you.

291
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,760
How could it be this bad?

292
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm calling the police.

293
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Don't.

294
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
What do you mean?

295
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,740
Even when you've been beaten this bad?

296
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,280
It was my organization's stuff.

297
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,330
You told me they were treating

298
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,400
each other like a family.

299
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,240
What kind of family could've done something like this?

300
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,740
I was the one who broke the promises.

301
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,300
I lied,

302
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,360
so I had to get the punishment.

303
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
It was the rule.

304
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,840
This wasn't a punishment.

305
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,960
They were clearly torturing you.

306
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,900
Why are you crying?

307
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,400
I never want to see you hurt like this again,

308
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,040
It hurts me everywhere.

309
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Come on.

310
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,400
Don't cry, My big boy.

311
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,860
It doesn't hurt me at all.

312
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,560
I don't want to see you in pain anymore.

313
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,440
From now on,

314
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,950
I won't have to be hurt like this ever again.

315
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's all over.

316
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,690
Let's start over together, Guy.

317
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,600
Aren't that hot?

318
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,960
I've had hotter than this before.

319
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,710
Stop it.

320
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,850
Even when you're hurt,

321
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,720
You're still thinking about this stuff.

322
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,920
This stuff has been on my mind all the time.

323
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,440
Come on, eat.

324
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,480
You're thinking... eat.

325
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,610
Why don't you blow it first?

326
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Soon,

327
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,720
Your wounds will be completly healed.

328
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Wish they hadn't healed so quickly.

329
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,280
Wasn't that good?

330
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,000
No.

331
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,280
I want you to take care of me longer.

332
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,520
Want another bruise?

333
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Where'd you like the wounds to be?

334
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Here?

335
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,680
Here?

336
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,200
Here?

337
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Or right here?

338
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,320
Did that hurt?

339
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Guy.

340
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Tew!

341
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,040
What the hell is this?

342
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,200
It's even worse inside, boss.

343
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
Look.

344
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,040
Everything's messed up.

345
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,660
This is my fault.

346
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,760
I'm sorry,

347
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,600
for putting you guys through my trouble.

348
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,520
I'm alright, Boss.

349
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,700
No problem.

350
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm completly fine.

351
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,160
We've promised

352
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,000
that no matter what happens,

353
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,120
we'll make it through.

354
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
Come on.

355
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,600
We need to stop wasting time.

356
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,320
Let's make the place back to the way it was.

357
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
Even if there are just three of us,

358
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,390
We can get it done easily.

359
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,960
Tul!

360
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,170
In the flesh.

361
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,710
Did you...

362
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,240
I've quit just as you did.

363
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,750
As you can see, I'm in bad shape.

364
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,740
Don't be the next person to punch me, Boss.

365
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,760
Who's gonna punch you, huh?

366
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Boss.

367
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,520
Boss.

368
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,000
Be gentle with my bruises.

369
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
Thanks a lot.

370
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,080
Are you okay, Tew?

371
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,200
Is everything alright?

372
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,280
You should take a rest.

373
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,320
Don't force yourself.

374
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Please.

375
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,350
Tew still hasn't gotten better.

376
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,360
Tul's in that condition too.

377
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,200
I think it would take weeks...

378
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,760
for the place to return to normal.

379
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,470
we need to find some people to help.

380
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Boss is right.

381
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Who are you thinking of?

382
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,760
The support has arrived!

383
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,120
Cleaning is my specialty.

384
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,390
I've been practicing to be

385
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,800
a housewife for my future hubby.

386
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,680
Anyone interested

387
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,600
Can submit an application right now.

388
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,800
Thank you so much everyone.

389
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,320
Let's do this, guys.

390
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,960
You took away my thrill again!

391
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,080
This restaurant's yours, right?

392
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,239
Can I apply for a job here?

393
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,719
I want to be a part of a young businessman's success.

394
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,400
But If the job's position isn't open,

395
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,239
I'm fine with the place next to you as well.

396
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,239
Muffin.

397
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,710
Job's roles are full,

398
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,040
and the one next to me isn't available.

399
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,679
This restaurant isn't just mine.

400
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,000
Guy owns it too.

401
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,480
After the cleaning's done,

402
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,600
We must become the VIP customers, Okay?

403
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,880
Receiving the discounts

404
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,909
for the rest of our lives.

405
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,159
That sounds like a good deal for you.

406
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,469
Tom's life would last for another...

407
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,280
Five...

408
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,600
Four...

409
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Three...

410
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,199
Two...

411
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
And then he'll die.

412
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,140
Way too fast.

413
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,760
Do you wanna get the life-long discount?

414
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,000
So about the deal we've made...

415
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,400
Don't be like that, I was just kidding.

416
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,240
What was the deal, you guys?

417
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,320
They helped us clear the place,

418
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,880
so we had to return to

419
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,090
compete in e-sports with them.

420
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,680
If you're in the team,

421
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I wouldn't worry about any other team at all.

422
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Guy.

423
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,040
If anything else happens, call me.

424
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,160
Which one do you want, sis?

425
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,580
Take it lightly, the meat isn't yet done.

426
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,510
Sorry.

427
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,630
Boss likes to eat raw.

428
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,340
Ah.

429
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,160
Could I just apologize, bro?

430
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,620
Eat the fish so you'd get smarter.

431
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,600
How's my grandma recipe?

432
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,320
Super tasty.

433
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
I think it's a bit too spicy.

434
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,080
I couldn't eat spicy foods

435
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,440
because I would pass out.

436
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Muffin!

437
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Don't you know

438
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,840
that he's already dating someone?

439
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Who?

440
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,920
When did he get one?

441
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,070
We were in the store for days

442
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,360
and didn't go anywhere else.

443
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
See?

444
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Muffin didn't know.

445
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,390
Give me thousand, now.

446
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,440
So who's your girlfriend?

447
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,840
Guy's my boyfriend.

448
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,120
Just worried they wouldn't believe.

449
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,920
No!!

450
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,080
This isn't my boss!

451
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,920
Just eat, jerk.

452
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Cheers.

453
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Cheers!

454
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,720
Everything's out and I'm still not full yet.

455
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,850
You're still not full?

456
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,840
Anyone need anything?

457
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,120
I'm going to the store.

458
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Sure.

459
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,960
Come Tul, to the store.

460
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,680
Grab something, anything.

461
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,720
I'll drink to forget that my heart was broken.

462
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,400
We must go now.

463
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Let's go.

464
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,080
I'm not sitting with you.

465
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,760
Tul.

466
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,520
How did you end up being a part of the gang?

467
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,920
I don't wanna talk about it.

468
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,400
After you've left the gang,

469
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,040
what are you going to do next?

470
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,520
Helping the boss with his restaurant.

471
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,570
What about the future?

472
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,750
Have you thought about it?

473
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,280
But I think that in the future

474
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,520
You'll always have me by your side.

475
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
So you wouldn't feel lonely.

476
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,720
Do I look like alonely person to you?

477
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,400
Ever since we've known,

478
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,320
You've always flirted with me.

479
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Aren't you tired?

480
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
I'll never be tired.

481
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,480
Everything I'd done

482
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,040
was because I'm really into you.

483
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,560
What if I say I'm not interested in you?

484
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,240
Then I wouldn't mind at all.

485
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,240
But I won't stop trying.

486
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
Seriously,

487
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,200
What's interesting about me?

488
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Well, you're...

489
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,760
Hold on a sec.

490
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,560
Guy asked me to get some more sauce.

491
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
I'll go buy some first.

492
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
I'll leave this to you.

493
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,040
Just hurry back.

494
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Kenji.

495
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Yeah, it's me.

496
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,000
You've been having fun?

497
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,640
Traitor.

498
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,720
Looks like they wanted to buy this place

499
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,440
to start a business.

500
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,240
I suspect he'd collect the protection fee for himself.

501
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,280
Should we tell the boss?

502
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,640
Not yet.

503
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,880
Send in the infiltrator.

504
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,200
Collect more evidence.

505
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,880
Come inform me if you know anything.

506
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Calm down, Kenji.

507
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,160
I never intended to betray you.

508
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,560
I've always told you the information.

509
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,920
You've disappeared

510
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,720
since he asked to resign from the gang.

511
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,640
Mr.Tew has really retired, Boss.

512
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,080
And that shabu place is a normal business.

513
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,600
Nothing was covered up, just like I said.

514
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,730
We can't let him live a good life.

515
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,120
What he did to me...

516
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,310
he must pay for it!

517
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,400
Kenji...

518
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,720
Tew has already left the gang.

519
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
Please just let him go.

520
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,000
Don't tell me what to do.

521
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
If you want me to believe

522
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,880
that you didn't betray me,

523
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
then go take care of it.

524
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,840
But if you can't deal with it,

525
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,720
You're fucking dead.

526
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,840
Did you hear what I said?

527
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,440
You wanna die...

528
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
huh?

529
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
I got it.

530
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,080
What took you so long?

531
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Sorry.

532
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,040
I had a stomach ache

533
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,480
so I stopped by the toilet.

534
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,200
So...are you alright?

535
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I'm fine.

536
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Let's hurry back.

537
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,920
Here, let me help you carry the bags.

538
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Thanks.

539
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,800
We're back!

540
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,640
Bring out the food now.

541
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,640
There's no more beer.

542
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,720
I'll go fill up the jug.

543
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,920
Bring it.

544
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,880
Alright.

545
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,520
Fill up a bit.

546
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
Thanks.

547
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,680
That's enough.

548
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
You want some, Tew?

549
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,680
Come!

550
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Cheers!

551
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,280
Bring it on!

552
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,920
Cheers.

553
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Bottoms up.

554
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,160
I'm so sleepy.

555
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Guy.

556
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
Feel something's wrong?

557
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,600
I'm so sorry, everyone.

558
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,930
(In time that you are here)

559
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,140
(I am so grateful)

560
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,620
(It's warm and so gentle)

561
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,970
(Happiness in my heart)

562
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,360
(But it’s just yesterday,)

563
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,900
(Love is a delusion)

564
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:48,900
(It changed, The time is spinning)

565
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,000
(Here it comes today,)

566
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,420
(As he came into)

567
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,400
(He held all over my heart)

568
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,170
(It’s like he used to it)

569
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,620
(Now it’s so intense,)

570
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,030
(Cause I know he’s the one)

571
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:15,940
(But there’s another one, Who I still love)

572
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:23,040
(Now it’s time to choose, For my heart)

573
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,700
(Please tell me what I should do)

574
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,590
(What if I choose him, Will he break my heart?)

575
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:36,560
(Please listen to me, My heart)

576
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:43,710
(I can’t stand hurting anyone)

577
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,820
(It is too hard, What should I do?)

578
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,720
(What if to do?)

579
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,830
(It is too hard, Please tell me)

580
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:15,280
(It is too hard, What should I do?)

581
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,230
(Now it’s time to choose, For my heart)

582
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,020
(Please tell me what I should do.)

583
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:34,050
(What if I choose him, Will he break my heart?)

584
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:38,350
(Please listen to me, my heart)

585
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:45,160
(I can’t stand hurting anyone)

00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,630
(It is too hard, What should I do?)

587
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,840
(What to do?)

588
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,000

589
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,830
(Please tell me,...)
