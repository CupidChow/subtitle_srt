1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,560
Whose house is this? It's freaking huge.

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,320
Chief Sun's house.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,320
Wow.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,030
As expected of a high-ranking person.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,770
Wait for me here.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,119
I'll go in there alone.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,240
You're offering an additional income from shakedowns

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,430
and protection fees for me?

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,860
That's strange.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,210
You wouldn't offer that to me for free.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,640
What do you want?

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,660
You can have it for free.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,539
But there is one condition.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,840
I must be the only person in control of everything,

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,810
taking Mr. Paiboon's place.

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,979
You've got some balls.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,560
You must have been well-prepared

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,880
to talk to me about this.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,720
Mr.Paiboon is like an old-tiger.

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,440
He's lost his strength.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,180
The only thing keeping him alive is his former glory.

22
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,720
It's time for him

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,520
to finally get some rest.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
In this line of work,

25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,880
Death is the only way to rest.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,460
That's the reason I'm here, to beg a favor.

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,840
If you help me on this day,

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
I promise

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,920
I'll return the favor

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,280
more than Mr.Paiboon has done for you.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,760
More than a hundred,

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,050
thousand times.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,640
Anytime you need my men to help

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
or anything else, just let me know.

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,760
His face has also been sickening me for a while now.

36
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,280
I appreciated that.

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,380
When the time is right,

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,200
You'll hear from me.

39
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,380
(As when our eyes meet every time,)

40
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,440
(I have seen you and myself in there)

41
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,230
(As when your smile captured my heart,)

42
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,460
(From the day that we first met. I’ve falling for you)

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,040
(Your smile has healed and calm the heart,)

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,650
(From things that crashing down the heart)

45
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,820
(The answer that my heart will only need,)

46
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:36,240
(It is you. Only you and always you)

47
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,579
(Could not trade for the world)

48
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:43,890
(With the best thing I have cherish right now)

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,810
(And it is you)

50
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,470
(Have never seen no one)

51
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,720
(That’s the best thing that came across me and my heart)

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,520
(What should we call it...)

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,910
(The place where it’s only ours)

54
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,130
(The place where it’s you and me)

55
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,150
(From now and ever)

56
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,490
(The place where we leave our tears and wounds)

57
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,660
(Cause it is our area)

58
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,500
(And I)

59
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,800
Kenji is planning to murder Mr.Paiboon.

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,840
Where?

61
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,320
Take me there right now.

62
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,040
No!

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm not letting you go.

64
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,120
He hasn't acted yet.

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,080
After you had cleared things up with him,

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Kenji went back to Mr.Paiboon

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,360
and told him the truth that

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,200
You didn't kill him.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,480
And now,

70
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,560
Mr.Paiboon has promoted Kenji as his right-hand man.

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,880
He's in the place he always wanted

72
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,000
and I'm no longer in his way.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,920
What's the point of killing the boss?

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,680
That wasn't all Kenji wanted.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
His goal is to become number one

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,400
without having to be under anybody else.

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,080
Because of my nosiness,

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,600
I knew he intended to betray

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,960
and kill Mr.Paiboon.

80
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,840
We'll never know when he'll

81
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,110
he'll start striking.

82
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,160
We need to alert the boss right away.

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
The only person Mr.paiboon will listen to

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,640
is you, Tew.

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,080
Got it.

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
I'll go warn him myself.

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,220
Hold on, Tew.

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,450
Boss.

89
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
You can leave now.

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,510
Tew and I are going to talk.

91
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,410
Do you really have to go back there?

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,640
The boss has done many things for me.

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,040
Today he's in danger,

94
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,590
then I must save him.

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,820
Returning to repay the favors?

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,540
When will it be over?

97
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,640
This is a serious issue.

98
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a matter of life and death for my boss.

99
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,770
Will you be able to get out?

100
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,500
If you go there,

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,460
You'll risk losing your life again.

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,720
This problem is entirely his own.

103
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,650
It's his own doing,

104
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,340
You were never part of it.

105
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,120
You only care about who has helped you.

106
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,300
What about my feelings?

107
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,610
Don't you ever care about that?

108
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,880
You've promised me, right?

109
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,520
That you would quit

110
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,690
and leave everything behind.

111
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,750
Please don't ever do that again.

112
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,640
I beg you.

113
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,020
If something happens to you

114
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,830
How will I live?

115
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,860
Am I not that important for you?

116
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,000
It's not like that, Guy.

117
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,110
If it's not like that,

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,400
Then you don't have to go anywhere.

119
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,390
I'm not letting you go.

120
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,500
Alright,

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm not going anywhere.

122
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,630
You promise

123
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,110
That you'll never go back to them again?

124
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,280
I won't go back.

125
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,680
I want to be with you.

126
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,000
Guy.

127
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,450
If I had to choose,

128
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,620
Then you're the most important person in my life.

129
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,290
You're also my most important person.

130
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,280
[Call Boss,]

131
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,120
[He'll tell you everything.]

132
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,740
[Send me the word when they're going to start.]

133
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,340
Tew?

134
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,940
I'm over here.

135
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,880
Give me a minute.

136
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Are you hungry?

137
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,240
Were you shocked to wake up without seeing me?

138
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,830
You shouted really loud.

139
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,600
No need to be scared,

140
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,290
I won't be going anywhere.

141
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,120
Boss's got the news.

142
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Tew.

143
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
Kenji will strike this evening.

144
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,840
Get ready,

145
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,350
I'll call you later.

146
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,200
Tew!

147
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,360
It's burning!

148
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,560
Sorry.

149
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,800
I don't usually cook,

150
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,160
So I couldn't time it quite right.

151
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,530
Don't worry, Tew.

152
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,320
It's just a little crispy, I like it.

153
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,920
Want some?

154
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,740
Come, Guy.

155
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,750
I'll walk you there.

156
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,090
I'm going to class now.

157
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Hey, Wahl.

158
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,550
Why is he here?

159
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,360
Did he bother you with anything?

160
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,620
He and I...

161
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
are back together again.

162
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,800
When we communicate with each other

163
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,400
on social media,

164
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,040
which channel does it go?

165
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,359
You guys know that?

166
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,240
Raise your hand if you can answer.

167
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,970
Guy.

168
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,520
I have something I need to talk to you.

169
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,650
Personally.

170
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,720
I just coming to tell you that

171
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
I have to stop by the shop.

172
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,800
I need to discuss something with Tul.

173
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,560
When you're finished,

174
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,720
Tell me.

175
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Boss.

176
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,440
Check all the other guns too.

177
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,680
The gun's frame, center, and trigger...

178
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,570
Check everything.

179
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,240
Okay.

180
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,660
Are you hungry, Tul?

181
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,360
Anything you wanna eat?

182
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,960
I think that gun

183
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
fell down once.

184
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,920
Try racking the slide to see if it's still working.

185
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Tul.

186
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,140
You won't talk to me about anything

187
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,520
other than work?

188
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,200
I have nothing to talk to you.

189
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,580
Again, I apologize for lying to you.

190
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,600
But my feelings I have towards you,

191
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,310
They are real.

192
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,230
Won't you ever forgive me.

193
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,770
I don't want to talk about this right now.

194
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,900
We'll talk after this shit ends.

195
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
We're going to die soon.

196
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,800
Dying without being forgiven is bad, you know?

197
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,440
The hell do you mean dying?

198
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,600
That's terrible speech.

199
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
Because of you, Tul.

200
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,040
Quit your yabbing.

201
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Check the guns.

202
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,510
We haven't been up here for a long time.

203
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,810
Yep

204
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,080
Normally,

205
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,760
When we had something we wanted to vent

206
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,400
or talk about,

207
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,130
We would come up here.

208
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,850
Because this is our place.

209
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,760
Because before,

210
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,000
I had nowhere else to go.

211
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,900
So wherever your place was,

212
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,310
it became our place.

213
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Guess things have changed.

214
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,840
You've got your own place now, right?

215
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,390
Maybe it was too late when I realized.

216
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,560
So late that...

217
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,600
The person who's always been beside me

218
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,670
might really have to disappear.

219
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm not disappearing anywhere.

220
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,140
You and I will be friends as we are.

221
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,040
Friends that care

222
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,110
and wish the best for one another.

223
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,800
Being happy

224
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,720
When the others are happy.

225
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,080
Never feel sad

226
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,870
When they're with someone else.

227
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,120
And also...

228
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,150
Not thinking of them more than friends.

229
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,080
But if you don't want to be my friend anymore,

230
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,530
then I...

231
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,000
Respect your decision.

232
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,070
I won't be your friend in the same way,

233
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,800
I will be your friend in the better way.

234
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,000
A friend who will not cause you any discomfort.

235
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,720
A good friend,

236
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,580
As one should have always been.

237
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,230
Kenji is heading to the guild.

238
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,000
Then we need to hurry up.

239
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,390
Where are you guys going?

240
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,850
Guns?

241
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,520
You're going to get rid of Kenji?

242
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,000
But you've promised me.

243
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,910
Tew

244
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,200
What are you doing?

245
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,120
Let me out!

246
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,240
Sorry, Guy.

247
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
I have no choice but to go.

248
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,680
You guys should hurry up.

249
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,040
I'll handle this.

250
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,680
Tew!

251
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,480
You promised!

252
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Tew.

253
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,600
We're too late.

254
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,640
Let me go now!

255
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,360
No, Guy.

256
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,800
Boss!

257
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,680
I can't.

258
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,960
Tew gave me an order.

259
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Don't you worry about Tul?

260
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,080
What if he's in danger?

261
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,280
What if something happens to him?

262
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,040
What if he dies?

263
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Boss.

264
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,560
When orders go against how you feel,

265
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,960
You don't always have to follow them.

266
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,950
Both of us wouldn't want to

267
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,200
lose our loved ones, right?

268
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,800
Please let me go.

269
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Tul!

270
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,870
I'm fine, go save boss.

271
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Boss!

272
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,140
You're finally here.

273
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,440
Well, you've always been so loyal to the old man,

274
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,760
Even though he tried to kill you.

275
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,720
Morals got in your way?

276
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,080
You're the only one...

277
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,160
That bites the hand that feeds you.

278
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,200
I gave you life,

279
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,400
Food, and water.

280
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,280
And you were so ungrateful.

281
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,200
You gave me life, geezer?

282
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,350
The shit-holes life that you gave me,

283
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,070
You always treated me like a dog

284
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,010
That waits for your scraps.

285
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,270
When you weren't satisfied, you'd beat me...

286
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,380
I had to endure all the abuse...

287
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,230
In order for you to achieve greater power.

288
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,880
And you expected that one day

289
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,870
I'd be loyal to you?

290
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,090
This shitshow of a life...

291
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,380
I never wanted it!

292
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,570
Today...

293
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,520
I'll be replacing you.

294
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,680
If you pull the trigger on the boss,

295
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll kill you.

296
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Boss!

297
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
Are you alright?

298
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,520
It's nothing.

299
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,760
You're having a deathwish?

300
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,880
Stop!

301
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,750
Piss off.

302
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,760
Boss!

303
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Come here.

304
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Guy?

305
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,400
You're going to shoot me?

306
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,050
Make sure you hit the target.

307
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,340
Careful not to blast this skull.

308
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,080
Drop the gun.

309
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,000
Drop it!

310
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,720
Don't do it.

311
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,240
You've replaced me.

312
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,640
What else do you want?

313
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,440
Revenge.

314
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,920
Anyone who has wronged me,

315
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,640
I'll go kill every single one of them.

316
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,960
It was stupid of you to let me live in the first place.

317
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,560
If I can get rid of everyone here,

318
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,720
then everything will be mine.

319
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,920
All mine!

320
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Die!

321
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
Boss!

322
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,720
Are you okay, Boss?

323
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Just go.

324
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,090
That hurt!

325
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Guy.

326
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,060
Why did you follow me?

327
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,430
I was worried about you.

328
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,520
If something bad happened to you,

329
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,240
How would I live?

330
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,600
I had the same thought.

331
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,080
If something happened to you,

332
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
I wouldn't be able to live either.

333
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,790
This is finally over now, right?

334
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,310
It's over now.

335
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,200
Tul.

336
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,120
Can you get back on your feet?

337
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
I can.

338
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,320
Let me help.

339
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,560
Please begin inspecting.

340
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,140
If something else's happening again, call me.

341
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,810
Hello, Pai.

342
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,440
Please come to the station for the interrogation.

343
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,480
[Several days later]

344
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,520
After that day,

345
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,400
Mr.Paiboon was heavily investigated

346
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,300
for various illegal cases,

347
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,080
but he never told the cops about any of us.

348
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,360
He also gave useful information to the police

349
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,120
regarding the mafia network.

350
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,270
As a result, Mr.Paiboon was held as a witness.

351
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,820
Go live your life, Tew.

352
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,100
Thank you for everything, Boss.

353
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,400
After that day,

354
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,080
Tew felt like he had a chance to live his life again,

355
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,440
and no longer had to deal with gangster stuff anymore.

356
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,320
You'd guess that

357
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
he'd return to continue the shabu place.

358
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Wrong.

359
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,860
The place has been sold.

360
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,400
Actually,

361
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,070
He didn't feel bad about it.

362
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,000
Because he thought that...

363
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,030
he opened this place just for the cover.

364
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,480
So the two of us figured that

365
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,610
We should do something

366
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,470
that was really our passion.

367
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,880
[Many months later]

368
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,580
When is this going to be over?

369
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,110
Looking won't make time go by faster.

370
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,880
Whatever.

371
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,110
Nothing to do with you.

372
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
What?

373
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,150
Worried you won't make it in time?

374
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,770
I dunno.

375
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,270
I'm worried.

376
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,560
Recently, I've had a lot to think about.

377
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,110
Today is an important day.

378
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,860
Actually,

379
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,450
There is no class attendance check today.

380
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,570
You can just skip it.

381
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
It's fine,

382
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
I think the class's about to finish.

383
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,640
See you next week, students.

384
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,280
Oh, perfect timing.

385
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,040
Hey, you.

386
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,679
Yeah?

387
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,000
I saw that you'd written down everything.

388
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,880
I couldn't catch up, may I have a look?

389
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Sure.

390
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Here.

391
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,120
Hey, Guys.

392
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,440
What kind of owner came after everyone else?

393
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,790
The place hasn't even opened yet,

394
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,320
and it's already on its way out.

395
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,760
Hey!

396
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,560
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

397
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,240
Chill, Bro, Calm down.

398
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,820
We're not thugs anymore.

399
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,470
How many more insurances do I need to be safe here?

400
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,550
My deepest apology to Mr.Tom.

401
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,960
Don't get carried away the next time.

402
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,430
We're on the same team now.

403
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,040
You're abusing your power

404
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,800
when Pai isn't around, Tom.

405
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
You want some of this?

406
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
Help me, Guy.

407
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,960
I'm being bullied.

408
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,590
Where is the other owner?

409
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,000
Where is he?

410
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Step aside, Muffin.

411
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,720
Muffin, help.

412
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,830
Come on, don't tease my boyfriend.

413
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Tew.

414
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,950
Now I'm really envious.

415
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,680
Boss.

416
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,070
So cool.

417
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
What's that?

418
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,240
The strawberry cake looks so good.

419
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,840
Tew's very talented.

420
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,550
Can I try?

421
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,680
Muffin!

422
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,000
Try this first.

423
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,280
No!

424
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,880
Where are you going?

425
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,080
Let's go,

426
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,000
Our boss is going to need some sweet moment.

427
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,960
Guess we have to go now.

428
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,950
Is this for me?

429
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,250
Feed me.

430
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,010
Open up.

431
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
Quick.

432
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,720
How's my food?

433
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,440
Wow, Tew.

434
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,150
You're so great.

435
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,190
Super cool.

436
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,640
Keep it down a bit, Guy.

437
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,320
Anyway, guys.

438
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Eat!

439
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,000
Cheers!

440
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,960
No one's including me.

441
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,440
Boss.

442
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,600
Pass me the Jaew sauce.

443
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,960
So freaking tasty.

444
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,730
The texture is very tough.

445
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,580
Just kidding.

446
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,890
You gotta be kidding me.

447
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,600
You're on!

448
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Muffin!

449
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,720
Guy, cheers.

450
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Guy.

451
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Go!

452
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,280
I think it's a little quiet.

453
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,190
How about we hop in a ranked match?

454
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,440
Let's play some game.

455
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,400
Come on, Muffin.

456
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,840
But Pai's not here,

457
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,520
so there's one person missing.

458
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,810
What about nearby shop?

459
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,540
Hey, everyone.

460
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
Oh, Wahl.

461
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,280
Wahl, Let's play a game.

462
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,080
Of course!

463
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,830
There's a lot of food to eat.

464
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,520
Enter the game first,

465
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,160
Don't focus about eating yet.

466
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,080
Alright, Tom.

467
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,110
I invited you in.

468
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,960
Okay.

469
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,100
Invite me too, Tom.

470
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,510
All done.

471
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,080
I'm in.

472
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,260
Ready guys?

473
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,930
Ready!

474
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's go!

475
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,640
Come on!

476
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,710
Careful, Tom.

477
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,240
Me and my friends...

478
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,800
Spend our time together in both the real world

479
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,980
and gaming world.

480
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,690
This is the reason

481
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,280
Why Tew decided to open this restaurant.

482
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,000
To be the place for our gathering.

483
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,280
A place where we can be together,

484
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,520
Have a laugh

485
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,400
and a great time together.

486
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,400
I can still go on, Tom.

487
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,200
We'll get going now.

488
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,760
Thanks.

489
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,120
Once the restaurant opened,

490
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,800
Many people suddenly came.

491
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,030
Yeah.

492
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,770
I never expected

493
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,000
so many customers on the first day.

494
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,050
Maybe there aren't many places

495
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,120
like this around here,

496
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,520
So people are excited.

497
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,120
You also made the place look very nice.

498
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,890
People have been saying nice things too.

499
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,870
Really!

500
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,480
Who's complimented about this place?

501
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Me.

502
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,670
Quit it.

503
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,760
Like I said, you didn't have to help me today.

504
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
Just let me be the only one who is tired.

505
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,360
I couldn't let you be the only one who was tired.

506
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,640
We've made a promise

507
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,680
that we will live an ordinary life together.

508
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,350
The ordinary life is...

509
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,640
Kinda exhausting, right?

510
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,560
But my entire life

511
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,390
has always been exhausting like this.

512
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,120
You life

513
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,890
has really been exhausting.

514
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,040
So, do you think it was a bad idea

515
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,400
that you chose me?

516
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
I do.

517
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,530
Eh!?

518
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,680
Haven't you heard?

519
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,600
They said,

520
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,400
The more dangerous,

521
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,080
The more alluring.

522
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,560
And because you're so dangerous,

523
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,310
I could never get away from you.

524
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,010
Wow!

525
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,550
Did you get your aggressive habit from me?

526
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,410
You like that?

527
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,760
Mr.Gangster.

528
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,520
More than you could ever imagined,

529
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,120
Mr.Gangster's boyfriend.

530
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,120
My Dear..

531
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,000
Is this a good idea?
