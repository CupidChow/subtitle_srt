 Episode 10 

2
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,070
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

3
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,490
Are you a Royal Guard?

4
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,870
That sword.

5
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,470
Where'd you get it?

6
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,220
I said, where'd you get it?!

7
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,520
What use would it serve you if you knew?

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,540
 Hwang Jin Gi 

9
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,600
Is it you?

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,670
Are you that Hyungnim Tiger's disciple?

11
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,710
So you are.

12
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,110
You're that Kim Che Geon's disciple, aren't you?

13
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,900
Master...

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,170
You know my Master?

15
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,010
Do you think I just know him?

16
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,240
I...

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,190
have a lot of  interest  in your Master.

18
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,700
For one statue of Buddha, I'll take one life.

19
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,420
A kid that should be with the Royal Investigation Bureau...

20
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,180
So why have you come here?

21
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,790
Do I...

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,430
still look like a kid to you?

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,670
I'll take care of this matter, so you go on ahead.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,260
Master.

25
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,060
Hurry and go.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,470
Hey, you.

27
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,590
Make sure to survive.

28
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,630
That way we'll have a match with each other.

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,000
Were you looking for me?

30
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,750
What is this?

31
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,220
Go to Seoso Gate and meet the Ace of Sixes.

32
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,450
Wait... Why do you want me to meet that rotten bastard, Ace of Sixes?

33
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,900
 Ace of Sixes 

34
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,010
Orabeoni, long time no see.

35
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,320
You're still a kid.

36
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,730
Search this area thoroughly!

37
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,740
Yes, Sir!

38
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,560
I guess tonight's not the night.

39
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,470
 Prince Yeoning (later, King Yeongjo) 

40
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,900
Baek Dae Gil...

41
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,410
What is going on?

42
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,600
Why am I here?

43
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,500
The night is cold.

44
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,520
Since I have started a fire, just stay there and rest a bit.

45
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,340
Let me take a look at your wound.

46
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,960
Even though your bleeding has been stanched, if we don't treat it quickly, it'll be dangerous.

47
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,370
Why are you doing this?

48
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,120
What are you talking about?

49
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,460
Pretend that you didn't see this.

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,130
I'm telling you to just leave me alone.

51
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,210
Why should I do that?

52
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,250
Because we are...

53
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,670
enemies.

54
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,700
Hey now. I even started a fire,

55
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,030
and now you're going to reject the benevolence from this country's prince?

56
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,200
I never asked you to do this for me.

57
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,080
Just sit.

58
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,060
Since you've lost a lot of blood, you could lose  consciousness.

59
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,320
And if you wander through this forest with the stench of blood on you,

60
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,060
you could become wolves' food.

61
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,690
And on top of all this, let's say you get out of the forest safely.

62
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,990
How do you plan on escaping from the soldiers who are currently searching for you?

63
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,150
If someone has to leave, I'll take my leave soon, so you just stay here and rest.

64
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,770
Please stop.

65
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,220
What do you think I'm going to do?

66
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,670
Whatever it is...

67
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,650
please don't do anything.

68
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,750
But I'll need to get some medicinal herbs for you.

69
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,870
Just wait here.

70
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,050
Hey.

71
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,660
You came faster than I expected.

72
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,410
What is this?

73
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,670
It's a water jade leaf (medicinal herb). There is nothing better than that on this mountain.

74
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,940
It must have taken you quite some time to find this.

75
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,000
Why don't you take it to her personally?

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,330
What? Does this hurt your pride?

77
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,560
Why, you bastard... This isn't the first time you've looked down on me.

78
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,280
Just who do you think you are that you can treat me with contempt like this?

79
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,440
Just looking at you, you're obviously younger than me.

80
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,720
W-What did you say?

81
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,420
You don't have friends, right? This is why you don't have friends.

82
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,670
Do you think there are a lot of people who have the same status as me?

83
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,980
If you want, do you want me to be your friend?

84
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,580
I don't need a friend like you.

85
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,900
Alright, whatever.

86
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,320
Still that bastard is...

87
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,200
Dam Seo...

88
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,570
Take care of her well.

89
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,350
Because you're probably a better choice for taking care of her than I, right?

90
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,170
Besides, I'm also quite busy right now.

91
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,250
What are you going to do?

92
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,190
Then, do you plan to bleed out?

93
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,100
Do you want to spend the night with me here?

94
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,410
Just close your eyes, and just count to one hundred.

95
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,240
It will be over by then.

96
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,230
Sixty-five...

97
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,840
Sixty-six...

98
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,950
Sixty-seven... Sixtyㅡ

99
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,630
What are you doing?

100
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,180
Why are you still counting when the treatment has been over for quite some time?

101
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,560
Did you really like my touch  that much?

102
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,220
Stop.

103
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,950
I want to stop as well.

104
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,930
I tried to speak cruelly to you

105
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,970
and I even put my sword to you.

106
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,520
I asked myself if what I did was the right thing to do

107
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,050
a hundred and more than a thousand times.

108
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,460
But...

109
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,530
I just couldn't control myself.

110
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,690
I really want to stop as well.

111
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,390
Now...

112
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,300
Then...

113
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,600
Why don't you stop it?

114
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,960
Then it would be better for you to kill me.

115
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Then that way, I can actually stop.

116
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,860
You don't think I could?

117
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,490
Do it... if you can.

118
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,550
You can't... either.

119
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,630
♬    I wish to love you  ♬

120

121

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,580

♬    When I close my eyes and yearn   ♬

124
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,860

125

128
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,820

132
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,450
♬    For as long as my heart beats and my breath continues   ♬

133
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,290
 Is Lee in Jwa the one who killed Dam Seo's father? 

134
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,850
♬ Don't forget my heart will always be beside you.  ♬

135
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,120
Dam Seo.

136
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:01,050
 I felt the warmth, but I did not deserve to receive it.  

137
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,180
 Please forget me now. 

138
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,980
 That is my last request. 

139
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,120
Follow us.

140
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,480
Put your heart at ease. I have no desire to harvest the likes of your tender life.

141
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,890
Have you ever
 Sookjong   

142
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,070
even opened your eyes once?

143
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,450
Watch clearly.

144
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,180
This is the place.  The place I last saw your father Yi Soo.

145
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,900
You must still  believe

146
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,370
that I killed your father, Yi Soo.

147
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,240
A king speaks no false words. Hence, take this to heart.

148
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,420
The one who killed your father, Yi Soo,

149
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,720
is not me.  It was none other than your adoptive father who raised you.

150
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,650
Your teacher, Lee In Jwa.

151
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,820
Disregarding his fate, he suffered death at the hands of  the man

152
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,060
who flings himself under the madness of his hollow ambitions.

153
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,090
Hence, you shall also

154
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,530
stop playing puppet to a man like him.

155
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,470
Now open your eyes, I'm saying.

156
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,770
Your Majesty, it's His Highness, Prince Yeoning.

157
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,340
I came to fulfill my promise to you, Royal Father.

158
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,920
Since I failed to stop the assassin...

159
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,210
You...  What in the world have you been doing all night?

160
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,120
 You ran out of life. 

161
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,490
 Though the assassin has already died, 

162
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,100
 Ace of Sixes' Brand 

163
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,860
 it doesn't matter because it's not like you don't know who was the mastermind. 

164
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,810
I did send a small gift to that man Lee In Jwa.

165
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:29,250
You should forget that child named Dam Seo,

166
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,500
How does Your Majesty know...

167
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,750
 The one who killed your father, Yi Soo, 

168
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,450
 was not me but none other than your adoptive father who raised you.  

169
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,990
 Your teacher,  Lee In Jwa. 

170
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,350
How did it go with the corpse?

171
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,540
That Ace of Sixes is such a swindler.

172
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,450
It cost me 100 nyangs to get a corpse about the age of the miss.

173
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,190
They'll be completely fooled.

174
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,450
So, I heard you met Kim Che Geon.

175
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,610
You should've given  a forewarning

176
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,830
so I could've had my sword sharpened first.

177
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,660
Then that wouldn't be fun, right?

178
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,800
Don't rush.  You'll meet him again anyway.

179
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,110
Dam Seo.

180
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,570
Look.

181
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,130
That day...

182
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,690
 Your father Yi Soo chose death himself. 

183
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,830
That was your father's conviction.

184
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,120
And it must be your conviction as well.

185
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:03,160
No.  My conviction isn't such.

186
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,630
In addition, no longer

187
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,550
can I serve you as my teacher.

188
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,900
I will fare my way, according to my convictions,

189
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,370
as I travel my path.

190
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,240
The king!

191
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,560
Dam Seo.

192
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
I'm sorry.

193
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,710
Was Dam Seo the one thing you gave away in order to take the king's head?

194
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,850
You failed to slash the king's head and only lost Dam Seo.

195
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,670
In the end, it was you that lost, My Liege.

196
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:24,250
Dam Seo won't be returning.

197
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,720
- Forever.
- No.

198
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,060
Dam Seo will one day know this too.

199
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,300
In this world,

200
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,850
there is no everlasting foe or comrade.

201
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,610
Your Highness.

202
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,650
How are you so late?

203
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,110
Royal Mother.

204
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,970
But what brings you all here?

205
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,170
It was quite a sight.

206
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,700
What did you see?

207
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,280
Your activity last night, Prince,
 Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip 

208
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,510
and His Majesty's heart, the king's mind towards Your Highness.

209
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,480
Hence, from this day forever, our Noron ministers

210
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,010
have come to be Prince Yeoning's strength.

211
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:04,110
Your Majesty, will you accept our intention?

212
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:11,220
 Is this my Royal Father's intention?  

213
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,030
Prince Yeoning, have you been well overnight?

214
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,590
Have you been well?

215
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,890
 Crown Prince Yoon (later King Gyeongjong)  

216
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,320
What is all this?

217
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,800
That's just a token of gratitude for your care for us.

218
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,960
No other meaning to it.
 Heo Baek Gi (chartered merchant) 

219
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,330
I haven't yet had my proper rest from travel.

220
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,010
Return all these gifts at once.

221
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,820
Since Minister Kim Chang Jip's return to the nation, the chartered merchants' movements have been alarming.

222
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,030
It looks as tough the chartered merchants are making their fast calculations

223
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,420
based on their sensitive awareness of  His Majesty's inclination towards you, Prince Yeoning.

224
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,320
If it's the chartered merchants, it would be Lee In Jwa who's behind them.

225
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,320
If that's the case, Lee In Jwa won't stay put.

226
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,240
Monitor Lee In Jwa's activity with the chief of the chartered merchants.

227
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,780
Yes.

228
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,490
Are you in, My Liege?

229
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:09,270
My Liege, the chartered merchants have turned their backs, it seems.

230
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,240
It's for the better actually, since I actually need an example.

231
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,650
Why did you summon us?

232
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:49,470
So I hear you've stuck to the Norons in a hurry.

233
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Your livelihood hangs on political power, so I understand.

234
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,690
Crown Prince isn't showing much improvement from his ailment, and you must fear

235
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:04,800
the momentum of Minister Kim Chang Jip who's been seated as the chief state councilor immediately upon his return from abroad.

236
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:11,790
But who's the one who's been looking after you?

237
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:17,150
On whose account do you live in such luxury right now?

238
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,010
It's upsetting to us for you to speak that way.

239
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,730
What if we keep adhering to the crown prince and he dies? And when Prince Yeoning becomes King?

240
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,710
I'm sorry but we can't follow you.

241
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,610
We need to find our own path, that's what I'm saying.

242
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,030
Then...

243
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:51,630
You'll need to repay what I've given you.

244
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,660
Though your help wasn't absent,

245
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,030
in the end it was we who brought alive the  mercantile charter, and it is our property

246
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,410
as well our base.  Not just yours.

247
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,450
No longer can anyone touch us now.

248
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,590
Let's all get on up now.

249
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:26,810
The frog forgets it was a tadpole.

250
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:30,470
You are a perfect example of that.

251
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,570
Well, then. Good bye.

252
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,510
I will give you a chance.

253
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:43,920
If you will all follow me, I will forgive you generously.

254
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,680
May you take care.

255
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,890
Lee In Jwa!

256
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,900
May you have a blissful rebirth.

257
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,950
Please spare me.

258
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:59,970
Nak Jeom Bul Ip (drop point not allowed). 
Once a baduk stone is placed, it cannot be picked up.

259
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,050
Please spare me.

260
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,840
Those who insult me.

261
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,220
Those who betray this Lee In Jwa!

262
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,930
Who else?

263
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,400
What is it?

264
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,530
It's the chief of the chartered merchants.

265
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,490
It's been verified that he attended the chartered merchant's gathering held at Wolyanggak last night,

266
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,080
but his whereabouts since are uncertain.

267
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,070
So what?

268
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,640
According to the informant, Lee In Jwa was there.

269
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,920
Lee In Jwa.

270
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,880
Your Highness, why are you here at this hour?

271
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,970
Why? Did I come at an inconvenient time?

272
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,320
Your expression is a bit unpleasant.

273
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,550
Are you hiding something?

274
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,180
Of course not.

275
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:14,220
Then, you won't mind me looking around a bit. Go through everything throughly.

276
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,100
Yes, Sir!

277
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,780
 Let's get on up now. 

278
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,140
 Then...  

279
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,120
Bring me the high-density vinegar 
( an acid that reveals blood stains). 

280
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,970
Here you go.

281
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,060
Blood stains.

282
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,840
 What exactly have you done? 

283
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,030
Prince Yeoning?

284
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,720
Well, the smell of blood doesn't disappear that easily.

285
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,600
Prince Yeoning will certainly not let this one go.

286
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,960
Since it's the chief of the chartered merchants who died, the issue is not Prince Yeoning.

287
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,440
It's the king.

288
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,030
A murder incident?

289
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,800
Murders happen all the time, though.

290
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,760
It's not as though a minister of the court has died.  Why are you chewing on it when the police will manage it?

291
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,830
The Crown Prince's baduk teacher, Lee In Jwa,

292
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,820
seems to be implicated in this murder case.

293
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,320
Why do you think so?

294
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,110
Though they are people who fill the pockets of the ministers without regard to party affiliation—

295
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:03,280
Those who chase after money are faster than you in figuring out which way power seems to flow.

296
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,880
Why would these punks who stuff the back holes of the Soron

297
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,740
jump on the Noron ship overnight?

298
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:17,980
It's likely because they deem the greater power is leaning toward you.

299
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,760
However...

300
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,420
Did you say the chief of the chartered merchants is dead?

301
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,620
We have not found the body. However,

302
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:50,900
Royal Father, I want to investigate this incident personally.

303
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,090
No. Stay out of it.

304
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,140
Why does the Chief of the Office of Inspector General meddle in a civilian murder case?

305
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,930
You are dismissed.

306
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,070
But Father—

307
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,940
I said you are dismissed.

308
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,960
 Why? 

309
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,350
 I am no longer going to be your wife. 

310
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:38,050
Do you know why I took you for my disciple?

311
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:46,450
You resemble someone I used to know.

312
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,940
Who is that?

313
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,310
I met him when I was young, when he was just about your age.

314
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:04,120
He's a tiger. He and I went through everything in life.

315
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,950
You look like him.

316
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:13,730
He must have been a handsome and wonderful person.

317
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,420
A tiger among tigers. King of the mountain.

318
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,210
He's like a mountain.

319
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,460
I'll be like him too, certainly.

320
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,310
A tiger among tigers, and king of mountains.

321
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,740
The Great Tiger.

322
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,200
You seem to show a little sign for that.

323
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:51,680
Now, don't you think this area is too small for you?

324
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,400
Why don't you go down.

325
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,270
Don't skip meals, and don't get involved in fighting.

326
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:22,120
Always be careful with your sword, understand?

327
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,950
Thanks, Master.

328
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,330
I shall never forget your help with this.

329
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,820
I'm willing

330
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,550
to give up my life for you, Master.

331
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,460
Thanks, truly.

332
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,100
How can you cry like a shameful chicken?

333
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,620
The sun is going down now, go.

334
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,590
Sir.

335
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,540
It's not visible for me.

336
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,170
Even with your extraordinary power, it's not visible for you?

337
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,990
No. The energy of Baek Dae Gil is too powerful.

338
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:42,630
It's no longer visible to me, as it it not for you, Sir.

339
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,180
Sir,

340
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,550
What is it?

341
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,110
All the bad-tempered folk are gathered.

342
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,690
I see.

343
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,980
You're excused now.

344
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,780
Aigo. This may be a big win, you know...

345
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,350
Hey, wait a second!

346
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,490
How can you have such big win now?

347
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,670
Oh, well. Let get going...

348
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,750
Pass it around quickly.

349
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,790
It's another big win again. What should I do?

350
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,410
Should we try it again?

351
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,060
Now, let's take a look.

352
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,660
Let's see...

353
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,940
Okay...

354
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,390
Let's take it easy.

355
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,530
Hey, man!

356
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,850
Regarding that Dog Blade, even the threading needle, hiding cards...

357
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,990
Let's take things easy, I said.
 Dog Blade Hwang Hae Do 

358
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,470
Even others' facial expressions behind him, he catches them all.

359
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,350
The secret Royal Inspector is here.

360
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,730
Which village on earth are you in charge of?

361
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,580
Due to the succession of drought years, the people's bones

362
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,110
are about to pierce through their flesh and stick out.

363
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,340
But I already distributed rescue grain to them.

364
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,330
You are using that as your excuse right now?

365
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,830
We've moved them all to the wagon.

366
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,520
W-Wait.

367
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:28,210
The tax rice isn't something even the three state councilors can readily touch.

368
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,620
Where in the world are you taking them to?

369
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,810
The three state councilors?

370
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:40,120
Yes, they can't without His Majesty's order.

371
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,680
It's a royal edict.

372
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,780
 He's that swindler Golsa who can forge anything in the world. 

373
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,340
 If he's inclined to do so, he can probably sell this whole Joseon. 

374
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,930
 And that guy has a really fierce temper. 

375
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,690
Does that even make sense?

376
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,810
How can you keep getting sixes in a row?

377
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,150
Aren't you playing a swindle?

378
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,630
Why, I...

379
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,230
Then you want to bet with me?

380
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,240
If I played a swindle,

381
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,380
then take it, my head.

382
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,740
If not, then your head's mine.

383
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,040
What of it?

384
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,420
I got it.

385
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:43,450
 He looks bloody and his nickname is Ace of Sixes. But...  

386
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,760
 Why have you summoned all those gambling masters together? 

387
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,490
 That's what I'm curious about. 

388
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,790
Why, our gambling master lords came a long way.

389
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,420
Let's see.

390
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,020
Your color's gotten better.

391
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,010
An animal is masquerading as a human.

392
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,360
Not as much as you, of course.

393
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,610
Aigo, are you a bear or a human?

394
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,560
Hey Meongcheongdo.
  (belittling way of calling Choongcheongdo) 

395
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:35,650
Meongcheongdo? Why, you Ssangdo bumpkin...

396
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,440
That's enough.

397
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,750
Hey Dog Blade, do you want to lose your other remaining arm?

398
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,950
What did you say?

399
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,510
Have you been waiting long?

400
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,050
It's been a while, everyone.

401
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,060
Ace of Sixes,  Swindler Golsa.

402
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,690
Dog Blade.

403
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,420
Hey White-Faced Scholar, you look great.

404
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,020
What's the matter?

405
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:18,330
I know you are all busy, but I had no choice since this issue is quite urgent.

406
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:28,150
 Recently, there has been a man who has been breaking through (sweeping in big) my gambling house. 

407
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,890
 A two, and a seven, adding up to a high nine. And that man has a one and a ten, 

408
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:03,490
 which means he has a winning hand with a high eleven. 

409
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:07,200
 And... he has a double four. 

410
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,790
Shall we start revealing our hands now?

411
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,600
I have a high nine.
 Two, Seven 

412
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,180
Then I'll show you mine! It's a high eleven!
 Ten, One 

413
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,060
Mine is a double four.
 Four, Four 

414
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:41,420
Why don't you all just stop now? Even if you are swindling together, isn't this going too far?

415
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,600
What? What do you mean we're swindling?

416
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,940
Who said we're swindling?!

417
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,980
If you don't have any money, then you should hurry and leave.

418
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,940
It's not a swindle?

419
00:52:53,940 --> 00:53:00,110
Of course not. Now why don't you show us your hand? You might have a winning hand.

420
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,180
So you're saying that this isn't a swindle, right?

421
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,770
D-Double six...?

422
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,640
You said it's not a swindle though.

423
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,420
Well, thanks to you folks, I had an enjoyable time.

424
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,960
 Gyeongsang Province, Busan, and Sangju. 

425
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,600
 And also Jeolla Province, Mokpo, and Gwangju, and even Cheongju of Chungcheong. 

426
00:53:53,830 --> 00:54:00,570
 My subordinates' gambling houses around the eight provinces have all fallen into that man's hands. 

427
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:08,230
Since that man passed through Cheongju about 15 days ago, I'm sure he will soon arrive at Hanyang.

428
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:14,930
Did our tiger-like White-Faced Scholar suddenly become a little mouse?

429
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:19,640
What? Did you call us because you're scared of that guy?

430
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,690
Who is he?

431
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,310
I'm sure you all know who Baek Man Geum is.

432
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:35,900
I've heard rumors that this man, Baek Man Geum, died...

433
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,760
at your hands.

434
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:48,340
The person who is going around breaking through my gambling house is not Baek Man Geum,

435
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,910
it is that person's son.

436
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,780
Are you okay?

437
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,080
Now, this is the last round!

438
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,910
Everyone please bet your money on the gisaeng you like.

439
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,520
Aren't they betting too much from the start?

440
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,130
Oh, they are such high rollers.

441
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,130
Whoa, whoa, who's that? Creepy.

442
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,320
What? What the heck?

443
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:08,160
Okay now! If you're all done placing your bets, we will start the game!

444
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,180
Wol Rang will throw first.

445
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,130
Oh my! She got a yeot!

446
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:18,560
Now it's our Chang Seong's turn!

447
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,000
Aigoo, better luck next time!

448
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,370
It seems our Chang Seong got a do!

449
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,440
Now for the final turn. She'll win as long as she doesn't get a mo!

450
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,500
She rolled a gae! That means our Wol Ryang has won!

451
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,160
Aigoo, a lot of people did place their bet on Seong Bin!

452
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,730
How can this happen? Aigoo!

453
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,590
Did you come here to catch me, White-Faced Scholar?

454
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,270
I am...

455
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,840
You've come?

456
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,530
What's up with this guy?

457
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,880
That's the mask.

458
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,870
Isn't that your mask, White-Faced Scholar?

459
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:19,320
But why is he wearing that?

460
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,910
I'm sure we'll find out once we take the mask off.

461
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,710
You're... Baek Man Geum's son?

462
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,770
I am...

463
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:58,110
I am a hunting dog that will bite off Lee In Jwa's neck.

464
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:03,950
Then why is a a hunting dog wearing the White-Faced Scholar's mask?

465
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:07,790
I wanted to find you, but I didn't know who you were.

466
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:12,340
And so I predicted that if I wore this mask, you would recognize me.

467
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,650
Why were you looking for me?

468
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:25,190
Starting today, do you want to break him,

469
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:28,960
the White-Faced Scholar, Lee In Jwa?

470
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,430
Why has Baek Man Geum's kid come here?

471
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:38,170
Why have I come? I came to break your gambling house.

472
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,160
To break it? You're going to break our gambling house?

473
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,300
Right. I'm going to break all of it.

474
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,880
All of the gambling houses in Hanyang. I'll break them all.

475
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,590
Baek Dae Gil.

476
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,630
Have you now become a tiger?

477
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,340
Why would a person become a beast? I am just a human being.

478
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,930
So? Are you going to beat me?

479
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:23,960
