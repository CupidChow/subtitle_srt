1
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,750
 The apex of power is the throne. 

2
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,320
 The one who wants to protect the throne. 

3
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,280
 The one who wants to take the throne.  

4
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,550
 1728, Yi In Jwa's revolt. 

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,570
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki 

6
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,190
 Episode 1 

7
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,030
It's been a while, aloof scholar.

8
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,030
Yi In Jwa.

9
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,550
 Also, the one who wants to stop him. 

10
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,340
 Janggi, Korean "chess" 

11
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,230
You're losing your pieces way too easily.

12
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,930
You give up your flesh to gain the opponent's bones.

13
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,180
Don't you know? It's the basic of the basics.

14
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,000
Say you could catch the king of your opponent,

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,570
if you lose all of your soldiers which are like your arms and legs, then what's the point?

16
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:14,300
Well, where would you use all those soldiers, after you keep them all alive?

17
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,430
Here, Jang Goon ("check" in Janggi).

18
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,380
How would you defeat a king without the sacrifice of the soldiers?

19
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,870
This is exactly the sacrifice for a great cause, don't you think?

20
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,430
For whom would this great cause be, and for whom would this sacrifice for?

21
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,830
It's for Joseon and for the people.

22
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,850
The people? How dare you talk about the people?

23
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,800
You are the one who would trample on the dignity of the people from all across the eight provinces, just to sit on that throne!

24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,300
The throne is the only way to change this corrupt Joseon.

25
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,080
No, we don't need a king that ignores the people.

26
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,660
If you do to choose to stand in my way, you too will be slain. Mercilessly.

27
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,350
Of course that's what you would do.

28
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,180
You will do things the way you want them to be done.

29
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,120
If you don't like someone, you will kill them.

30
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,610
Do it. If you can do it, then do it.

31
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,660
Baek Dae Gil.

32
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,730
Yi In Jwa.

33
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,410
I'm going to the Capital.

34
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,420
There, we will...

35
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,450
   

36
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,910
meet again.

37
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,950
Yi In Jwa...

38
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,330
He's a nobleman, so he sure knows how to talk.

39
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,220
But by the way of the world,

40
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,890
the people always win at the end.
( jol - lowest ranking soldier )

41
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,010
 Jackpot 

42
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,180
 1693, the Capital (today's Seoul) 

43
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,710
It's still not done?

44
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,570
It's done!

45
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Hey! I won, I won!

46
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,640
Hey! I won! I won!

47
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,270
Honey!

48
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,930
Honey...

49
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,230
- Come outside!
- Wait, wait!

50
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,910
What's wrong?

51
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,400
Why don't you just hit me?

52
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,920
You're making me leave the house when I had such good luck!

53
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,880
Why are you doing this?

54
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,750
What? Who am I? Who am I?

55
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,860
I might be wearing old clothes and crinkled shoes, but I'm still from a noble bloodline.

56
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,070
I'm your husband. Even if you treat me like heaven itself, it would be insufficient. How dare you?

57
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,650
Even a gambler, is still a husband,

58
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,160
Who's the one who had to endure all this?!

59
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,570
It's me. It's me!

60
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,120
Why are you crying? It's so embarrassing in front of the neighbo–!

61
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,540
Darling, I'm not doing gambling because I want to.

62
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,500
The only things I can do are gambling and stealing. That's why.

63
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,570
I'm afraid that I might suddenly get pregnant in this situation.

64
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,770
What are you saying? Just give birth to a son.

65
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,210
You don't think I, Baek Man Geum, won't be able to feed his wife and child?

66
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,260
You sure know how to talk.

67
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,960
You must be tired. Let's stop it.

68
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,730
Here. Buy a chicken for us to enjoy.

69
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,860
I'll make a big money today.

70
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,790
Go inside, I'll be back.

71
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,940
 Just give birth to a son. 

72
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,240
 You don't think I, Baek Man Geum, won't be able to feed his wife and child? 

73
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,790
Sorry.

74
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,920
No matter how much I hate him, he's still my husband.  I can't make him starve.

75
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,770
Is there someone there?

76
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,790
Did you hear something?

77
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,670
Look at this orebeoni. Are you trying to fool us because you can't pay?

78
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,870
Let's see. It was a rabbit, wasn't it—

79
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,970
I'll get bad luck for three rounds if you look at my cards. And it's a wildcat, what rabbit ?

80
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,420
Pay attention to your own cards.

81
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,910
Really...

82
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,170
 10, 1, 3. 

83
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,600
This person just won.

84
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,420
Look!

85
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
 Stop! 

86
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,340
Oh!

87
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,430
Sister Hong Mae?

88
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,190
Orabeoni. (older brother, like modern oppa)

89
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,430
To me, men are three kinds.

90
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,230
Blood-related family, my underlings who work for me,

91
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,790
and, the guys who give me pleasure at night.

92
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,560
But my father lost everything because of gambling. I killed my husband while he was seeing another woman.

93
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,330
That's what happened because they played around with my money.

94
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,820
I'm the one who caught my father.

95
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,670
You think I won't be able to end your life? There's not even a drop of blood shared between us.

96
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,960
Sister, why are you saying those words so cruelly?

97
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,790
Maybe you don't understand me.

98
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,300
Do you know who I am? I'm Hong Mae. Hong Mae!

99
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,800
Who said I wouldn't pay you back?

100
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,660
You said you'd pay me back.

101
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,090
How are you going to pay me back? Are you going to sell your wife?

102
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,590
Wh-Wh-Why not, I can sell anything.

103
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,230
If I don't have money, well, there's still my wife...

104
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,360
Really?

105
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,290
Alright, then try it with that resolution.

106
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,060
A hundred nyang. I took 20 nyang off for interest in advance.

107
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,700
Since the the bookkeeping should be accurate.

108
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,310
That's poison.

109
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,030
You do know how to bargain.

110
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,060
Who are you? I think you've seen the wrong person.

111
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,640
You should eat. You have important things to do tomorrow at the Royal Palace.

112
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,610
How do you know that I work at the palace?

113
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,110
Of course, I do.

114
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,530
You won't have to starve any more.

115
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,760
You won't have to fight against the cold wind, while living in a crumbling three-room house.

116
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm saying that you no longer have to worry about being taken away for all your husband's debts.

117
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:38,350
What in the world do you want from me?

118
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,730
  You won't have to starve any more. 

119
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,940
 You won't have to fight against the cold wind, while living in a three-room house that's falling apart. 

120
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,940
 I'm saying that you no longer have to worry about being taken away for all your husband's debts. 

121
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,450
 Tongmyeong Hall 

122
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,920
  After a rainstorm, the king always takes an early morning walk. 

123
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,020
  He makes about two laps without any palanquin or parasol.  

124
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,230
  He then visits the Tongmyeong Hall, where the deposed  Queen Inhyun lived. 

125
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,430
  You will have to place the queen's shoes in the corridor of Tongmyeongjeong Hall.  

126
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,600
  Then put a big lotus leaf on top of them.  

127
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,560
  Then you'll need to wait. 

128
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,540
 He will definitely come to find you.  

129
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,110
 Once he is within five steps of you, you have to lift your head. 

130
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,740
  Look him in the eyes for exactly three breaths. 

131
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,340
Stand up.

132
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,000
Lift your head.

133
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,900
 You must make eye contact with him for three breaths. 

134
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,290
 His heart will shake at the first one. His heart will cling. 

135
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,190
 Then at the third one, his heart will be yours. 

136
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,810
Are you the one who put a big lotus leaf on top of the shoes?

137
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,700
Why did you do that?

139
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,200
The Queen used to...

140
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,330
The former queen used to put her shoes there.

141
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,180
If it rained, I always put a lotus leaf over her shoes, so that they wouldn't get wet.

142
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,770
It's a habit now.

143
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,610
What is your name?

144
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm Bok Soon.

145
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,450
Your Majesty.

146
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,380
What has caused the Queen to come here so early in the morning?

147
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,830
And you, Your Majesty?

148
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,960
Well...

149
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,090
I was just taking a walk.

150
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,670
 Jang Ok Jeong (Royal Noble Consort Hee of the Indong Jang Clan) 

151
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,760
 Is that all? 

152
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,400
  It is. Isn't it easy?  

153
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,330
 King Sook Jong 

154
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,380
Bull's eye!

155
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,880
That is, of course, to be expected of His Majesty.

156
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,970
Your Majesty, you're a natural-born archer.

157
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,290
Listen to those halfhearted words.

158
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,150
If you keep listening to them, your stomach will start to hurl.

159
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,950
Are they not your ministers who take care of you?

160
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,310
You have no idea.

161
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:52,590
What they want is not a king, but a puppet they can control.

162
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,520
So at the right time,

163
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,080
I will discretely sweep them out.

164
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,280
Bull's eye!

165
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,110
That is called politics, Yi Soo.

166
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,770
You, who is worse than a beast,

167
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,070
do you know how many lives have been sacrificed for you?

168
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,590
Do you really not know?

169
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,930
You. Why aren't you shooting?

170
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,190
 Restrain yourself. Even if you kill the king, the world won't change. 

171
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,040
  Changed and replaced whenever it's needed, 

172
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,660
  the king is such a thing that can be replaced. 

173
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,030
 There will be a day that will ease your anger.  

174
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:40,530
 There will be a day when your arrow will be embedded in this king's heart. 

175
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,280
 However, until that day... 

176
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,390
Bull's eye!

177
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,470
  You will have to be patient and hold everything in. 

178
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,350
Take it easy. No one will recognize it even if you do it that hard.

179
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,570
Isn't it great to have something to do? They give you something to eat and you don't have to worry about starving.

180
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,250
Even if we say nice things for 100 days, no one will acknowledge it.

181
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,190
Take it easy.

182
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,870
You're right.

183
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,290
 His Majesty the King is coming! 

184
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,970
You are called Bok Soon?

185
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,770
Then I'll see you again.

187
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,870
Isn't there any way I can get some money?  Damn...

188
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,880
My genealogical tree!

189
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:38,150
It's the genealogy of a noble family. I should get 50 nyang, at least.

190
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,480
What is this?

191
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,890
This witch!

192
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,110
Where did she get such a large amount?

193
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,390
I don't give a damn.

194
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,020
 Yi In Jwa 

195
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,620
Are you really expecting His Majesty to have a crush on me,

196
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,370
a lowly woman?

197
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,090
Yes, I am expecting him to do that.

198
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,940
I am a married woman!

199
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,960
Weren't you taken by a gambler when he won a game?

200
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,860
Married or living together, it doesn't matter

201
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,080
if we share a blanket, because doesn't just that make us a married couple?

202
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,410
No matter what, it's up to you.

203
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,350
What do you think of these two options? Baek Man Geum, gambling addict, or the King of Joseon?

204
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,490
Which of these two options will you pick?

205
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,150
You have mistaken me.

206
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,710
Even though that man is of low status and gambling addict, I cannot do that.

207
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,090
The money that I received will be returned to you by tomorrow.

208
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,230
Don't go too far.

209
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,030
You will come back anyway.

210
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,300
Okay, let's see what we've got.

211
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,360
One.

212
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,650
What am I supposed to do with those crappy cards! Nothing!

213
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,170
Then I can take it, right?

214
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,680
I have four. Four!

215
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,710
Hold on.

216
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,890
You haven't seen mine yet.
 (10, 10, ...) 

217
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,410
I won.

218
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,890
What are you looking for?

219
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,910
Are you really asking because you don't know?

220
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,500
If you don't tell me, how would I know?

221
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,310
Where's our pedigree? WHERE'S OUR PEDIGREE?!

222
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,530
How can you sell our pedigree?

223
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,770
Oh...

224
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,350
Our pedigree... I just put it out there.

225
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,840
Why are you making such a fuss over nothing?

226
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,820
You shouldn't have touched our pedigree.

227
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,090
What's so good about your high status? That's all you have!

228
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,310
WHY DID YOU SELL OUR PEDIGREE?!

229
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,380
Go get it.

230
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,120
We can't live without it.

231
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,950
Even if we live this way,

232
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,010
our child shouldn't live like us!

233
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,790
By the way,

234
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,010
about that bundle of money inside...

235
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,890
Do you know what kind of money that is?

236
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,990
Honey.

237
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,070
 Please tell me. 

238
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:32,630
What should I do?

239
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,090
I can't live like this any more.

240
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,570
Become the king's woman.

241
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,150
 What? 

242
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,250
His Majesty is with that damn palace maid again?

243
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,950
That wench...

244
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:16,030
How is it, Bok Soon? Don't you like it?

245
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,850
It's not that, Your Majesty.

246
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,090
Well, of course,

247
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,110
This is nothing compared to your gifted beauty.

248
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,450
Bok Soon.

249
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

250
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,150
Bok Soon.

251
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

252
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,230
What's wrong with you?

253
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,350
I...

254
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,790
I have a husband.

255
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,230
 I have a husband. 

256
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,510
Is anybody there?

257
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:45,670
Find out more about that girl Bok Soon.

258
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:52,330
Where she lives, who she's living with, and what she does for a living.

259
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,910
Your Majesty, Bok Soon of the Choi clan is from Jeolla Province

260
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,350
and she lost her family to the plague.

261
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,490
 She came into the palace when she was twelve years old as the palace maid for the deposed queen. 

262
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,390
 She was sold to a gambler, Baek Man Geum. 

263
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,430
 She prepares her husband's breakfast as soon she wakes up. 

264
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:18,590
 In the palace, she washes piles of clothes and dishes all day. 

265
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,030
 After the palace's work hour, she always works in the gisaengs' rooms. 

266
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,630
 Otherwise, she sews all night. 

267
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:30,630
 Even when it's like that, every three or four days, her money is stolen by her  gambler husband, Baek Man Geum 

268
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,890
 and he loses the money. It happens over and over. 

269
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,630
What kind of person is that Baek Man Geum?

270
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:44,050
He is from a noble family that lost everything.

271
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,810
He is now an idler at the gambling den.

272
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,150
How dare you stir up His Majesty's mind? You lowly wench!

273
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,810
Please spare me, Your Highness.

274
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,350
Please spare me.

275
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,570
You think you can ride in a palanquin thanks to this face?

276
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,730
You'd better not come back to the palace ever again.

277
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:35,750
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki 

278
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,410
You're Man Geum's wife, right?

279
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,890
Who are you?

280
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,550
I have something to tell you.

281
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,230
Your Majesty, is something bothering you?

282
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:15,030
I just have quite a lot to think about.

283
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,190
- If there's anything I can do— 
- No.

284
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,030
I appreciate it, but it's not something you can help me with.

285
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,630
Perhaps, is it about Maid Choi?

286
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,530
How did you...

287
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:46,370
 Yi Soo, you'll have to grant the king's wish soon. 

288
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,590
Your Majesty, I apologize for saying this,

289
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,660
but I visited gambling dens when I was younger,

290
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,590
so I know about gamblers' behaviors.

291
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,730
Do you?

292
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:15,070
Then do you know a man called Baek Man Geum?

293
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,630
 He's just a good-for-nothing who's addicted to tujeon (Korean traditional card game), nothing more 

294
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,970
 and nothing less. 

295
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,670
Did you perhaps...

296
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,670
Wife. Why? Wife!

297
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,430
Wife, why?

298
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,690
What the hell are you...  (Traditional wedding rings) 

299
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,010
How dare you treat your husband...

300
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,610
Are you planning to sell these rings at the gambling den, too?

301
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,950
Sell? I'm just thinking of using them for a while and putting them back.

302
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:22,150
How long are you going to live like this?

303
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,460
Did you ever, even once,

304
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,090
even just one time,

305
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:39,550
think of me as an important person?

306
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,770
Wife.

307
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,470
No.

308
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,890
I don't have a husband like you.

309
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:57,430
 Wife, just believe in me, Baek Man Geum. 

310
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,850
 I'll earn some money, and all the gold and the jade that I will find,  

311
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,190
 I will give them all to you. 

312
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,570
 For now, this. 

313
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,330
Those are the last things I'll give to you, Husband.

314
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,670
Wife.

315
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,030
You're really beautiful, Sister-in-law.

316
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,130
I was right, wasn't I?

317
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,300
Wife!

318
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,950
What are you doing right now?

319
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,210
You should've been good to her from the start. You're a bit late, aren't you?

320
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,380
Move aside. You're not moving? Move!

321
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,180
Dear! Bok Soon!

322
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:35,010
Why are you staying there? What a pitiful view.

323
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,800
You rotten woman.

324
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,240
What are you going to do with my Bok Soon?

325
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,710
At the rate you're screaming, you're going to break your vocal cords. Move your hand before I break your wrist.

326
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,360
Orabeoni.

327
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,800
What do you think I do with other people's wives? Eat them or something?

328
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,370
I'm this close to beating you up if you don't shut up!

329
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,450
Are you done talking?

330
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,930
Yes. Even so,

331
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:05,010
this witch is still thinking about you, so I'll tell you something.

332
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,260
Hanyang's biggest fool is coming to my gambling hall.

333
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,590
What gives you the right to say these things to me? Whose fault is it that I'm in this state right now?

334
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:19,060
This is a guarantee from me. He's such a fool that you can win enough for a tile-roofed house.

335
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,810
How about it? Let's try.

336
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,130
You witch!

337
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,630
Have you been waiting long, Sir?

338
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,110
I heard you run a big trade business with the Qing Dynasty.

339
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,730
This way please.

340
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,670
Do you want to play a specific game?

341
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,860
I don't care.

342
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,800
How about cards? I'll get a player.

343
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:28,340
Also, my cut will be ten percent of what you win.

344
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:34,150
You can just take that.

345
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,100
Oh, you could have just given this to me on your way out.

346
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,610
Have fun.

347
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,440
You don't look like a gambler. What's your occupation?

348
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,050
I'm a merchant. I go all around the dynasty.

349
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,130
Do you know how to play?

350
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,770
Yes, sort of.

351
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,080
Our meeting is fate.

352
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,570
- How about a drink first? 
- No, thank you.

353
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,170
My stomach doesn't feel good, so I'll pass for now.

354
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,750
Ah, is that so?

355
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,620
Let's play with fervor.

356
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,580
Let's do that. Take it slow,

357
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,260
and let's start.

358
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,300
 (8, 8) 

359
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,150
 (2, 7, 7) 

360
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,550
 (9, 2, 9) 

361
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,000
 Your Majesty, first, please make him be blinded by the gold. 

362
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,400
 Make him be blinded by the gold? 

363
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,150
 Baek Man Geum has a gambling debt that he cannot possibly pay back. 

364
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,810
 So if you want to spend some money on him,  

365
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,490
 he will bite that bait right away.  

366
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,150
I have quite a bit of money on me.

367
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,850
It's my first time playing cards.

368
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,620
You don't know how to play cards, but you still came here to gamble?

369
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,090
I have so much money, and there's really nothing I want to buy.

370
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,470
I'll think I'll just

371
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,960
spend it on my hobbies.

372
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,070
I'm thankful that you have such a hobby.

373
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,030
 Second, you'll have to make him lose his concentration. 

374
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,610
 The money you will lose will be just a bait. 

375
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:24,010
 Your goal is to make Baek Man Geum lose his sense of judgement. 

376
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,080
 Please keep offering him to drink. 

377
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:33,240
However, drinking alone...

378
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:39,670
It's no fun. Come on, have a drink with me.

379
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,550
Fine.

380
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,910
Since you lost quite a bit of money,

381
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,190
I'll have to be your drinking buddy.

382
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,080
You should have done this from the start.

383
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,600
You can't play cards.

384
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,850
Do you know  how to play Jjogi?

385
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,430
I don't.

386
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,600
How about majong?  Do you know majong?

387
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,390
I've never heard of it.

388
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,500
Aigoo... Ah! How about Ssang Ryuk?
 (a kind of backgammon) 

389
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,650
You don't know how to play Ssang Ryuk either?

390
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,340
I've never heard of that either.

391
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,440
You don't know any of those?

392
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,750
I can play Tu Ho.
 (pitch-pot) 

393
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,340
I know it.

394
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,440
The type of game where you throw arrows at an empty pot?

395
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,800
A lowly peasant like myself has never played such aristocratic games, nor do I know how.

396
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,880
What are we going to play then?

397
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,630
We can't do any of those.

398
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,530
Shall we stop?

399
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,100
 Gamble on an easy game to clearly show him that you have no skills in gambling. 

400
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,320
 You have to make sure he wins it. 

401
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,100
Ah, I have a good idea.

402
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,310
- What is it? 
 - What if we played a betting game with this wine?

403
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,770
We'll pour alcohol and water each in a similar bottle.

404
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,990
The person who can pick out the wine bottle is the winner.

405
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:25,470
The chance of winning and losing is fifty-fifty. This game is very fair.

406
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:30,290
Shall we try? It's fair...

407
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:34,660
I was the one who suggested it, so I will let you choose.

408
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,850
- I can?
- You can choose the next bet if you'd like.

409
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,900
How about it?

410
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:51,370
Anyway, the chances are half and half.

411
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,560
Alright let's do it!

412
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,200
Those two pieces are worth 100 nyang.

413
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,060
You are putting down 100 nyang at once?

414
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,680
Why? Am I not allowed?

415
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,000
No, you can, but...

416
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,880
Here, bring one bottle of wine and one bottle of water.

417
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,580
You will choose first, go ahead.

418
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,600
 I got it. 

419
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,740
 It's the one with water that has condensation. 

420
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,540
 That one with old dry stopper is the wine bottle because it has never been opened. 

421
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,330
 Wife, I will keep my promise. 

422
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,670
 I'm finally winning. 

423
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,680
This is the wine bottle.

424
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,170
This wine is very well ripened.

425
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,880
Won't you have a cup?

426
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,400
You have such great luck, Sir.

427
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,860
Have you chosen now?

428
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,440
This is no fun, I haven't won yet.

429
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,760
Don't be so hard on yourself.

430
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,050
Have some more to drink.

431
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,590
Then should we, for the last time...

432
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,770
Do you want to play just one more game?

433
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,660
What about spinning a coin?

434
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:58,940
This is also a fair game because the chance of getting either heads or tails is 50/50.

435
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:10,150
 This coin, the same kind from the Royal Mint, that I have been using for so many years. 

436
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,560
 Look at this, it is from Euhyeong-Cheong (Royal Mint). 

437
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,210
 Right! When you spin it, 

438
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,470
 this coin always comes up tails, 9 out of 10. 

439
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:31,270
 Heads! Heads! Heads! Heads! 

440
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:42,250
 This coin comes up tails nine times out of ten. 

441
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,320
What about raising a stake a bit more?

442
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,690
 If I win this game... 1,100 nyang? 

443
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:59,460
 If I use all this money to pay off my debt, I'll still have 700 nyang left over. 

444
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,780
 The heavens must really be helping me. 

445
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:16,560
Since you suggested this game, I will choose first. May I?

446
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,580
You may. However, I will be the one to toss the coin.

447
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,930
I agree. I bet tails.

448
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,550
Then I will bet heads.

449
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,500
Since I am the last to win, the happiness is doubled, is it not?

450
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,880
It is probably because of this feeling that people gamble.

451
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:13,480
 This is just a coincidence. Just one-time-only coincidence. Probability never lies, it never does! 

452
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,370
If you are fine with it, how about repeating this bet?

453
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,350
One more time?

454
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,200
Well, I don't really care.

455
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,670
  This is a specially forged coin from our armory, so please believe me.  

456
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,810
  It will always come up heads. 

457
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,810
Then...

458
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:52,500
I will bet 200 nyang on tails, again.

459
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,980
Then I will bet on heads.

460
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,500
Here I go.

461
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,960
You have lost. This time, it's heads again.

462
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,640
Let me try again.

463
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,000
I don't see why I would refuse.

464
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:59,240
I already took back what I had lost, and it seems my luck is good too.

465
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,740
Your life depends on this money, don't you know that?

466
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,510
I know. I know.

467
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:13,260
 Our orabeoni has to live long, though. 

468
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:23,820
This time, what will you choose?

469
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,020
I choose heads.

470
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:33,030
Heads? Well, it did come up heads twice.

471
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,930
- Then, I'm—
- No, no.

472
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,960
I bet tails.

473
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,880
I don't think it will come up heads three times.

474
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,640
We'll see. You don't know that.

475
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,220
Wait!

476
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,130
Let's change the coin.

477
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,210
Let us use this one.

478
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,970
Let's use this one.

479
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,620
As you wish.

480
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:13,400
This has been fun, thanks to you.

481
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,250
Wait! Wait! Let's do one more! One more!

482
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,590
One more game!

483
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,900
You look like you have nothing.

484
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,670
No! I will bet my wrist!

485
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:30,940
What do you want me to do with your wrist? It's useless to me.

486
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,750
Of course.

487
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,770
What do you think of this?

488
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:54,640
Can't you find those cheap things anywhere?

489
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,000
This will not do,

490
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:05,510
unless you intend to offer up the owner of these rings.

491
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,140
I will bet her on it!

492
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:45,210
I will bet my wife!

493
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,670
So instead of money, you will bet your wife?

494
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,670
Are you serious?

495
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,400
I am serious!

496
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,670
Of course, I am!

497
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:30,290
  Well, even if you lose Bok Soon, you should have nothing to say.  

498
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:36,270
Since you have bet your precious wife,

499
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,750
I will bet 10 pieces of silver, 500 nyang.

500
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,090
I agree.

501
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,400
Then,

502
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:08,030
I will choose the game, and you will play it first.

503
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,270
Hey, you.

504
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:19,350
Give me that bottle and cup.

505
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:29,250
This alcohol. How many cups will it fill?

506
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,410
  Isn't it six cups? 

507
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:37,070
  No. 

508
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:42,260
 First he filled his cup... one, and the next, two, 

509
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:48,490
 three, four, five, six.  

510
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:55,610
  Seven. It's seven cups.  

511
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:03,370
- It is seven cups.
- Then I will guess six cups.

512
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,590
It is six cups.

513
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:35,270
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki 

514
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,730
 - Preview -  

515
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,400
 A premature baby of 6 months, Your Majesty? I never heard such absurdities! 

516
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,700
 This child will die soon. 

517
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,090
 Baby, please grow up healthy. 

518
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,210
 Leaving the cause of future problem bothers me.  

519
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:06,200
 - The child is alive.
- You have to kill him.
- This baby must die. 

520
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,510
 You will be punished! 

521
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,950
 - Who are you? Who sent you here?
- Your Majesty. 

522
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,280
 Bring that man's head to me. 

523
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,110
 - What happened to my child? 
- SHUT UP! 

524
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:19,550
 If you want to save the baby, come to the gazebo outside of the Great Western Gate.  

525
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,400
 Lord!
