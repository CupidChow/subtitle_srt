1
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,610
 Joseon's best tajja player, Gae Ttong 

2
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,170
 has finally arrived in Hanyang!  

3
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,380
 Gae Ttong, no, Dae Gil,  

4
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,430
 you rascal, are my son.  No matter what anyone says,  

5
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,690
 you are my son, Baek Man Geum's son.  

6
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,970
 Dae Gil.  

7
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,370
Father.

8
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,440
Father, Father!

9
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,880
It's already too late.

10
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,120
What...

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,490
What do you mean?  Are you crazy, Grandpa?

12
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,660
Are you crazy? I said!

13
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,360
Where's Father? I can't leave without Father.

14
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
It's too late, I said.

15
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,570
It's been over two hours already.

16
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,780
Please tell me.

17
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,850
Why on earth did you kill that man?

18
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,190
Back off.

19
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,230
I can't back off.

20
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,310
Baek Man Geum should have already

21
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,230
died 20 years ago.

22
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,500
Just regard it as a sacrifice for the Great Cause.

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,010
Is that the only reason?

24
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,570
Just over such a reason...

25
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,790
Dam Seo, that's enough.

26
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,870
Please tell me.

27
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,380
One who sucks the bloody pus of the people to fill his greed.

28
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,820
One who is worse than a beast. One who deserves death.

29
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,440
Shouldn't those be the people that I kill?

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,140
Are you angry on my account?

31
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,360
Then you should slash me.

32
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,250
Are you choosing to kill yourself before me?

33
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,050
My Liege.

34
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:53,350
If that's what you believe, then it's better that you slash me with that sword.

35
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,010
Why do you falter!

36
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,920
What is this you're doing?

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,970
Please tell me.

38
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,950
Why did it have to be that man's father?

39
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,650
That child Baek Dae Gil... is of the reigning king's bloodline.

40
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,260
The reigning king's child?

41
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,810
That rascal is none other than the first child of Royal Noble Consort Sook Bin Choi.

42
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,310
Hence it can be said that he is the hidden treasure card

43
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,710
who can stand against the current king and Prince Yeoning.

44
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:41,250
Still, I cannot fathom the death of that father.

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,020
Isn't he an innocent man?

46
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,680
How are you so foolish when you have seen it already?

47
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,150
Can that immature delinquent be the opponent of Prince Yeoning?

48
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,450
Nothing can make a person as strong as hatred can.

49
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,150
For the sake of the Great Cause,

50
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,880
the likes of human lives and beliefs

51
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,260
can just be let go?

52
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,150
What is your belief that you say such a thing?

53
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,670
How is it you couldn't kill Baek Man Geum?

54
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,610
How is it...

55
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,900
you couldn't slash me?

56
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,740
That weak mind of yours will come to hurt you,

57
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,350
and come to hurt me.  Do you really not understand it?

58
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,610
Is it not enough?

59
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,720
Still?

60
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,230
I have endured and endured these years on that hatred.

61
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,550
But is it still not enough?

62
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,550
What exactly is the Great Cause?

63
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,390
And Teacher's belief,

64
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,430
what is it that...

65
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,610
Dam Seo, you are my daughter.

66
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,270
And you are my life.

67
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,440
And you are my everything.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,730
That is my Great Cause.

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,460
And that is

70
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,310
my belief.

71
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,960
You bastards!

72
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,840
Save my father!  Save my father!

73
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,540
FATHER!!!!

74
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,760
Why that sickle?  Why are you holding it?

75
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,250
To avenge. After I find that punk who did that to my father.

76
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,710
Hey, you punk. You'll get in big trouble carrying that around.

77
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,810
Put it down.

78
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,960
Then I should just endure it?

79
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,480
Endure it after seeing that plight?

80
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,800
My father died in front of my eyes?

81
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,700
I don't even know which punk did it or why he died!

82
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,890
A gambler died.  What reason is needed?

83
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,650
Death by beating, death by knife, death by starvation.

84
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,120
Blinded in sight, limbs cut off,

85
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,730
half-cripples are rampant (among gamblers).

86
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,050
Reason? What reason?

87
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,180
Gramps,

88
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,560
don't look for me.

89
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,950
Dae Gil.

90
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,190
That punk again?

91
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,100
You got yourself a pretty boy next to you instead of a chit today.

92
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,180
But who in the world could you be

93
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,630
that you come and grind my money away every fortnight,

94
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,470
when you're not a moneylender or a jackal?

95
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,670
What?  Did I commit some wrong?

96
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,110
No, not really, but in case...

97
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,050
Could you be some infamous high-roller I don't know about?

98
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,800
I sometimes do gamble to cool my head.

99
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,380
But I'm just a student who lives by books.

100
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,310
Alright.

101
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,920
Your good looks say otherwise.

102
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,980
What are you waiting for? Roll out a table for him.

103
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,740
Yes.  This way.

104
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,160
 Where in the world...is all that large amount of money... flowing into?   

105
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,210
Back off, you all!  Or else on your boss's throats,

106
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,180
I'll scratch the character 'one' (ä¸€).

107
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,020
Back off now, everyone.

108
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,240
We've already seen enough bloodshed. Why are you doing this?

109
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,480
It's scary. Let's talk it out.

110
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,300
I won't give a long explanation.

111
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,530
Where's the bastard who did this to my father?

112
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,990
Your mean the lord,  White-Faced Scholar? (meaning "a scholar reading books only, but not involved in politics")  

113
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,920
White-Faced Scholar? I don't know who that is, but

114
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,710
it looks like you're going to have to lead the way to his house.

115
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,910
I sure know that, but...

116
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,980
Fine, let's go.

117
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,030
It doesn't matter to me if you die or he dies

118
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,090
or just both of you die rapidly.

119
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,760
What has happened? It's way past the time he should find me.

120
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,130
Move aside. If you don't want to croak.

121
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,850
Lord, please save me.

122
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,150
 A man who knows the true importance of one nyang is a true gambler.  

123
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,150
Are you sure it's him?

124
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,210
I didn't see it with my own two eyes but...

125
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,660
You killed my father? Is that right?

126
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,010
What if it were?

127
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,010
Why did you kill him? Why?

128
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,050
What did my father do so wrong to deserve death?

129
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,900
If you know, will Baek Man Geum rise from the dead?

130
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,200
Shut that mouth, White-Faced Scholar!

131
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,120
Don't speak my father's name lightly.

132
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,630
I have buried your father's corpse in a sunny place on a hill behind your house.

133
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,270
You should go pay your sincere respects.

134
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,700
If you want to obtain revenge against me, become a Great Tiger first.

135
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,240
I mean you should go garner the strength to break me.

136
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,080
I will always be here.

137
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,290
Stay right there!

138
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,240
I'm sorry. I can't feign ignorance.

139
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,450
If you want revenge, pick up that sword.

140
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,150
Don't regret this later.

141
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,810
Right now, without mentioning the teacher,

142
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,870
you can't even touch me.

143
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,050
Move.

144
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,480
Do I look like a dog to you?

145
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,620
Crazy bastard. You must really want to get killed.

146
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,490
Yeah, you little punk  still wet behind the ears.

147
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,780
Who am I? I'm Hong Mae!

148
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,990
You thought I'd croak from the sickle act of a thing like you?

149
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,290
Stop.

150
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,600
We can't let such a ill-mannered bastard live.

151
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,040
Like father, like son.

152
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,680
He's going to come put a knife into my belly one of these days.

153
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,000
So I must kill him. At least make him a half-cripple.

154
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,900
Customer, why are you here?

155
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,050
As for me, I came because I'm fond of that girl.

156
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,340
Let's not overdo it.

157
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,270
The moonlight and night are nice.

158
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,070
Can you save him?

159
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,570
Yes.

160
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,860
What brings the Prince to a shabby place like this?

161
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,150
I came because I heard a rumor that a tiger lives in these foothills.

162
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,600
I must've found the wrong place.

163
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,640
There's no tiger, just a wildcat.

164
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,310
And are you confident you can handle meeting a tiger?

165
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,440
That's true.  I'll be lucky if I don't pee my pants,

166
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,740
if it's a real tiger.

167
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,130
However, once the sun is up, at the gambling den,

168
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,060
and once the sun is set, as a ginyeo (gisaeng) of Wolhyanggak.

169
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,500
What is this girl's identity?

170
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,350
It's true that she is a gisaeng.

171
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,620
She is also an archery teacher to the mesdames of high-ranking officers.

172
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,780
She's also my student.

173
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,050
This woman's many talents could allow her to jump over the palace walls as well.

174
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,460
What?  Is she harboring a grudge against His Majesty?

175
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,760
Your joke went too far.

176
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,890
What do you mean a joke? Your family was exterminated during the Gapsul Hwanguk Change of State (1694).

177
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,350
It wouldn't be strange to say you might harbor a grudge against His Majesty.

178
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,520
Am I wrong?

179
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,260
 What is it that you wish to earn by taunting me?  

180
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,710
 Show your claws. 

181
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,290
 The claws you're hiding. 

182
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,440
 The likes of a mere prince... 

183
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,340
 Do you think you can touch me? 

184
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:15,750
 At least I can cut out your potent tongue. 

185
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,040
How is he?

186
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,610
There's no place where he's not injured.

187
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,390
Even breathing like this is a miracle.

188
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,200
When he wakes up, don't mention me.

189
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,800
Yes, I understand.

190
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,120
 (King Sook Jong) 
You want me to give you the powers of inspection?

191
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,750
 Prince Yeoning (later, King Yeongjo)  

192
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,360
This is the  daily inspection log.

193
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,980
What on earth do you wish to do with the inspection authority from the Office of the Inspector General?

194
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,920
   Daily Inspection Log 

195
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Do you know the reason for the easy death

196
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,400
of a motherless tiger cub?

197
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,350
It's because they easily reveal their claws too soon.

198
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,030
I'm sorry,  Royal Father.

199
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,580
When you were young,

200
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,830
I used to often tell you something.

201
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,190
The tale about the monster who controlled the rain.

202
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,240
Do you remember?

203
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,180
Are you talking about the monster with 100 ears and 1,000 eyes?

204
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,190
 Yes. 

205
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,590
 The monster looked so strange 

206
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,580
 that their fear overpowered their gratitude for the rain. 

207
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,780
 So there were those who threw rocks 

208
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,150
 and those who poked him with spears. 

209
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:17,680
 The monster could only tolerate so much, and made it rain enough 

210
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,660
 that he could come out of the well, 

211
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,760
 and he swallowed those who tormented him. 

212
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,770
Fearful that the sky will dry up if one is to kill it,

213
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,780
but fearful of future troubles if it is allowed to live.

214
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,250
What shall we do with this monster?

215
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,150
The monster seems to have a good nature to begin with,

216
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,550
so I would persuade him well and send him to a distant ocean.

217
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,820
What about you?

218
00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:00,960
Father, you cannot appease or kill that monster.

219
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,270
Moreover... I cannot even speak of him.

220
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,420
Why so?

221
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,800
Because that monster is none other than...

222
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,790
you.

223
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,950
 Daily Inspection Log  

224
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,980
From this day forward, you are to serve as a high-four ranked officer in the  Office of the Secretariat,

225
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,450
As of today, I will appoint you as Chief Inspector at the Office of the Inspector General.

226
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,130
I will do my very best,

227
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,590
and I will not betray Royal Father's expectations!

228
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,380
Look at me straight in the eye.

229
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,120
What do you mean, "Chief Inspector"?

230
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,140
Did what I said mean nothing to you?

231
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,430
Why would that be the case?

232
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,200
"Don't get involved in politics."

233
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,130
"When visiting King Father for the morning greeting,

234
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,430
refrain from saying anything but the greeting, how has he been overnight?"

235
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,050
"Make sure to drink a lot and play with girls every night,

236
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,580
and become a complete

237
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,010
hooligan and a playboy."

238
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,680
I know. I've heard it so often my ears became raw.

239
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,250
And for hundreds and thousands of times

240
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,460
I've tried to become that.

241
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,360
But what difference has it made?

242
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,990
Just what did I gain from doing that?

243
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,440
For these past years, I have listened to Royal Mother's words

244
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,220
and have lived the life of a hooligan and a playboy.

245
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,950
Just what have I gained from that?!

246
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,830
Prince Yeoning.

247
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,320
Do you not know that that is the only way that can help benefit youâ€”

248
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,370
No, it is not.  I have grown up now.

249
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,200
I am an adult.

250
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,730
As for the path that I must now take,

251
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,520
I will find it on my own.

252
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,400
Your Highness...

253
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,610
Your Highness!

254
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,920
I have heard that Prince Yeoning brought in a patient last night.

255
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,010
Ah... T-That is...

256
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,750
He was definitely here about two hours ago... Where did he...

257
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,150
 I have buried your father's corpse in a sunny place on a hill behind your house. 

258
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,690
 You should go pay your sincere respects. 

259
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,400
Father!

260
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,880
Father...

261
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,800
Aigoo, this person...

262
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,010
Father...

263
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,880
Father, I have come.

264
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,140
Your son,

265
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,570
Gae Ttong.

266
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,550
Your son, Gae Ttong has come!

267
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,760
FATHER!!

268
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,660
Father...

269
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,590
Do you remember this?

270
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,750
The time when Father, Grandpa, and I

271
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,890
traveled the eight provinces carrying a chicken?

272
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,360
It was really fun back then.

273
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,590
Right, Father?

274
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,510
Aigoo...

275
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,440
Why did you prepare such a hearty meal?

276
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,190
Just eat.

277
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,410
Wait.

278
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,970
Is this a funeral meal?

279
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,710
Did you prepare a funeral meal so you could die?

280
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,210
Hey, you brat. After you prepare this funeral meal

281
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,250
and stare at me with an eye that wants to die,

282
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,960
do you think I will be able to eat this?

283
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,820
Do you think I can?!

284
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,120
Hey, you...

285
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,650
What do you think you're doing?

286
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:17,920
Grandpa. Thank you for  feeding me,

287
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,850
taking care of me, accepting  my immature behavior, and comforting me up to now.

288
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,800
But...

289
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,820
My heart, right here...

290
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,740
my heart hurts so much that I can't live this way any longer.

291
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,590
It's so unfair and I'm so full of anger

292
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,980
that I can't even breathe properly.

293
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,060
I don't care even if I die.

294
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,950
Either that scholar dies, or I die.

295
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,090
This will all be over if one of us dies.

296
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,120
You do what you need to do.

297
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,250
You don't even know gratitude for my taking care of you up to now.

298
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,000
You ungrateful little bastard.

299
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,340
You know that already, Grandpa.

300
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,440
That I have always been a hooligan.

301
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,960
Don't wait for me or look for me.

302
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,450
I, Baek Dae Gil, will end everything today.

303
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,950
Dae Gil, you bastard!

304
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,390
COME OUT, WHITE-FACED SCHOLAR!

305
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,590
You came a lot sooner then I expected.

306
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,180
Step aside.

307
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,450
Don't hesitate if you are determined to kill me.

308
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,980
I will give you a chance.

309
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,180
Now...

310
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,080
Shoot.

311
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,370
That is not how you shoot an arrow.

312
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,040
Your legs must be spread shoulder-width apart to be balanced.

313
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,770
And when you pull on the bow, it is not with the arms,

314
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,650
it is through your shoulders.

315
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,750
Also, you must aim at  forehead, philtrum, uvula, and heart

316
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,950
with firm resolution to end everything in one shot no matter what happens.

317
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,440
Shut up!

318
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,430
I don't need your petty lectures!

319
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,870
So, you're saying you're prepared for this, are you?

320
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,740
I will give you another chance.

321
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,080
Kill me with that arrow.

322
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,290
But! This time, you must be prepared to risk your life as well.

323
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,730
Do you still want to continue?

324
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,860
And what if I do?

325
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,820
Think carefully, then decide.

326
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,490
This decision can either end my life,

327
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,300
or cut off your limbs.

328
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,410
Now. Which hand is it in?

329
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,530
You crazy bastard. JUST DIE!

330
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,570
I will give one more chance.

331
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,420
Stop this playing.

332
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,190
You should have seized the chance when it came to you.

333
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,950
By the age of nine, I had finished the Four Books and the Three Chinese Classics, and at ten,

334
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,880
I have memorized all of the contents of the Chinese Historical Almanac.

335
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,070
What have you done?

336
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,560
Just under your gambling father

337
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,480
you must have played the baby.

338
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,410
At the age of 15,

339
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,260
I mastered the Eighteen Fighting Methods

340
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,950
and discussed  politics with the renowned scholars.  What have you done?

341
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,950
Shut up.  What do I care what you did?

342
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,850
Die. Just killing you is all I need.

343
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,390
My father's enemy.

344
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,330
I had already watched clearly with my own eyes

345
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,400
the disaster of my whole family being exterminated.

346
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,350
A month, a day, an hour, a second,

347
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,490
not even once until now,

348
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,050
have I ever forgotten the enemy!

349
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,030
I clearly told you that you'd become a great tiger.

350
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,750
Go home if you don't want to lose your two legs.

351
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,540
Why? Is there any reason for you not to kill me?

352
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,120
 Whether you die or I die, 

353
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,860
one of us must die.

354
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,440
Definitely!

355
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,130
Do you still intend to keep doing this?

356
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,860
From now on, apologize to him on your knees!

357
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,810
Right! You should be like this.

358
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,160
Take this punk to his home.

359
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,070
Let me go.

360
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,350
The risk to lose my life,

361
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,450
I've already thought about that more than several hundred times under the blanket (last night).

362
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,250
So let's finish today, you f**king bastard.

363
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,420
I'll do it again even if I am maimed

364
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,140
or I become a cripple.

365
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:16,150
Until I stab your neck with a knife, I will come again.

366
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,420
So if you want to kill me, kill me now.

367
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,930
Fine. If that's your wish,

368
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,410
I have no reason not to do it.

369
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,850
We had this kind of situation before.

370
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,210
I had aimed the arrow at you.

371
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,470
But, you survived being stabbed by a knife and

372
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,150
overcame even my six-nyang (tael) arrow with your extreme luck.

373
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,330
You were only a baby.

374
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,850
I'm just curious. Really,

375
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,620
how will it go today?

376
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,950
Your extreme luck only comes this far.

377
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,450
My Liege, he is alive.

378
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,330
I saved your life.

379
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:57,050
This coin saved your life.

380
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,680
What should we do with this man, My Liege?

381
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,870
Throw him off.

382
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,330
Teacher!

383
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:26,300
Let's see, since he has such good luck as this,

384
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,710
whether he can survive falling off this bottomless cliff.

385
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,850
Teacher, he'll die. There can be no chance of survival.

386
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:40,650
If he dies, that, too, is his fate.

387
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,250
Hey, White-Faced Scholar!

388
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,690
Is it too easy?

389
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,870
Since you so easily trample on a person

390
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,240
who doesn't have anything or power nor any worth,

391
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,210
you don't have any fun, do you?

392
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,760
So how about betting one game with me?

393
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,410
You like a bet.

394
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,660
Betting on Baek Dae Gil's, my life...

395
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,880
What kind of bet?

396
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,360
With this wrecked body,

397
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,990
if I fall off that cliff, it's  a 100% chance that I'll die.

398
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,050
If I survive, you'll grant my wish.

399
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,010
Fine. Let me hear your wish.

400
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,630
At my father's grave,

401
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,250
you make an apologetic obeisance to my father on your knees.

402
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,360
Then I'll forgive you.

403
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,450
It isn't a grand wish.

404
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,710
Alright, I'll accept your bet.

405
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,150
However, before that, I do intend

406
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,600
to stab your heart one more time.

407
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,860
Do you still want to bet?

408
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,810
Even now, beg him for your life.

409
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,910
Then, you can live.

410
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,340
I'll be back alive.

411
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,450
Without fail.

412
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:09,150
I'll wait for you to show up after you become a great tiger.

413
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,300
Dae Gil's sandals...

414
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:12,000
Does that mean... Dae Gil is dead?

415
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,680
Dae Gil.

416
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,080
Dae Gil! Aigoo.

417
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,610
I can't live without you!

418
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,450
You called me.

419
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,390
He is probably alive.

420
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,120
You broke his arms and legs and stabbed him in the chest.

421
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,890
You threw his ruined body off the cliff,

422
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,890
so how could you believe he's alive?

423
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,710
It's impossible, if he's human.

424
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:57,270
As long as I don't give up on him, he won't die.

425
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:04,450
Without my permission, he won't die and can't die,

426
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,710
so you need not feel guilty, Dam Seo.

427
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,730
Teacher, do you truly believe he is still alive?

428
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,400
That... we shall find out.

429
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:18,050
Why are you here so late at night, Prince Yeoning?

430
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,060
Were you waiting for me?

431
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,980
Are you looking for something here?

432
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,260
You  hid the gold,  money, and ledgers away quickly.

433
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,140
What are you talking about?

434
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:51,080
To where have you smuggled all of that large amount of money?

435
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,320
I don't know why, but I feel offended.

436
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,790
- If you're a prince, can you enter someone else's estate without permission?
- What?

437
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:06,320
Please leave. My good will ends here.

438
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,760
Has he left?

439
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,500
Yes.

440
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,560
Prince Yeoning moves faster than I thought he would.

441
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,640
The side that's lacking is always more diligent.

442
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,600
The tiger cub slowly reveals his claw.

443
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,840
Then an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

444
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,100
Dam Seo, you meet Lady Sook Bin.

445
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,780
Pardon?

446
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,800
Don't worry. You don't need to climb over a wall.

447
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:20,390
My Lady.  Is the fortune that's told  by the master of Wolhyang Restaurant really good?

448
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:25,770
She is a good fortune teller and a scary woman as well.

449
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,660
My Lady, the master of Wolhyang Restaurant has arrived.

450
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,480
Tell her to come in.

451
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,050
I was a bit surprised.

452
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,350
I didn't think Your Highness would look for me.

453
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,270
I called you because I have something to ask you in secret.

454
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,350
Who is that child?

455
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,890
She is my family member whom I cherish.

456
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,450
My name is Dam Seo.

457
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,830
How pretty.

458
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,330
Wait outside.

459
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,250
Yes. Lady Master.

460
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:45,890
Who's inside?

461
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,170
The master of Wolhyang Restaurant.

462
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,310
The master of Wolhyang Restaurant... Do you mean Hwang Gu's mother?

463
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,870
Why would Mother meet her?

464
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,340
What is this?

465
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,780
A boy's birth year, month, day and  hour, the four pillars.
 (which influence a person's fortune or fate) 

466
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,000
October 13th, Gyeyu year (1693),  Chukshi (1â€“3 am).

467
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,920
Does this child really lean his back against the world?

468
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,370
I mean, is he dead?

469
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:31,160
My Lady,  can dying or living  be dependent on someone's order?

470
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:50,290
  Go and bring Prince Yeoning's daily inspection logs. 

471
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:58,180
 Turning left around the corner of  Lady Sook Bin's residence, you'll find the detached building at the end... 

472
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,060
 That is Prince Yeoning's residence. 

473
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,950
Have you found it?

474
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,550
You were looking for this daily inspection log, weren't you?

475
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,630
At night, you treated me like a mouse.

476
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,810
How entertaining it is to see your expression now that the positions have been reversed.

477
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:02,890
I... got lost on my way back from meeting Lady Sook Bin.

478
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:09,830
If you're going to lie, at least put some spit on your lips.
 (implying that one's lips get dry when lying) 

479
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,280
I'll take my leave now.

480
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,380
You should stop here.

481
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,680
What do you mean?

482
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,440
Stop risking your life here and there,

483
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,420
and just live an ordinary life.

484
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,900
I don't like it either.

485
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,600
Everywhere my feet touch. The literary and martial officers' burning eyes and ears.

486
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,260
Those who interfere with everything, my royal father,

487
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:49,010
and my royal mother's attendants included, I loathe them all.

488
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:57,710
If I could, I would have thrown away everything and left.

489
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:08,700
But you. You can do it, can't you? You can throw away everything and leave.

490
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,270
I move according to my beliefs.

491
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:18,100
No, the wrong belief will end up hurting you in the end.

492
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,020
 What do you know? What on earth do you think you know?! 

493
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:28,400
Your Highness! Are you in there? It's Sang Gil. I'm coming in for a moment.

494
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,260
Your Highness! Your Highness!

495
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,260
Where the heck did he go?

496
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,730
Let's get out.

497
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,090
I'm pretty sure he was in here...

498
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,230
Aigoo...

499
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,340
What on earth do you think you're doing?!

500
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:28,680
Why this... I even lowered my dignity to help hide you,

501
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,770
and you repay me with a slap in the face?

502
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:38,690
Why? Do you want me to call that guy over again? Tell him that a thief has entered my chamber?

503
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,830
Is that so? Then... Heyâ€”

504
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,690
And don't take this the wrong way.

505
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,620
You're not even my type.

506
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:07,640
His Highness has disappeared! Hurry and find him!

507
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,120
What commotion is this?

508
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,230
I just... Just a moment ago, Iâ€”

509
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,020
I was taking a nap. Why are you making such a loud commotion?

510
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,160
Okay...

511
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,590
Ah, and also Sang Gil. Go get me a bucket of water.

512
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:36,740
Huh? A bucket of water?

513
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:42,730
That's right. M-My throat is parched. Very parched.

514
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,250
Okay...

515
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:09,810

516
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:21,220
Now, after you turn by this pavilion is my mother's residence.

517
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:27,020
For what happened today... I would prefer if nothing had happenedâ€”

518
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,780
Did you not come here to steal this? Hurry and take it.

 Daily Inspection Log 

520
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,390
Why would you...

521
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,910
We'll need to know more about each other. What we want,

522
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:45,220
and what our objectives are. Or...

523
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,090
what we like.

524
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,420
Go. This is as far as my mercy goes.

525
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:15,700
Dae Gil's fate. So, have you looked into Baek Dae Gil's fate?

526
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,180
Yes, Samhyeongsal.  (triple kill) 

527
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:23,290
The fate of a king born with triple swords.

528
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:28,910
That kid... You're telling me he is born with a king's fate?

529
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:34,870
However, since the fate he was born with is so strong, if he meets an auspicious fate, he can be king.

530
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:39,040
But if he meets an inauspicious fate of moving around, not settling down at one place,  then even if a breeze blows,

531
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:47,180
he is to have the most wretched fate of falling off a bottomless cliff.

532
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:55,930
So, how is he? Is he still alive?

533
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:01,310
He is dangling from the brink of a precipice, but he is still alive.

534
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,040
So he is still alive...

535
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:11,600
How is he? In your eyes, how is he?

536
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:43,590
Born under the triple-kill fate...

537
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:49,380
the fate of a king, on the path from falling off a cliff,

538
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,280
he has met an auspicious fate.

539
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,320
An auspicious fate.  He's taken the sword in his hand then?

540
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,000
Yes.

541
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:09,690
 That which slashes the mountain and divides the seas, the best martial power under the skies. 

542
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:13,040
He has met the King's blade.

543
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,420
W-W-Water...

544
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,590
Your eyes are definitely that of a tiger... Who are you?

545
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:11,870
Shall we make a bet? A bet whether I will live or die?

546
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:30,080
â™¬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  â™¬

547
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:36,590
â™¬  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  â™¬

548
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:41,910
â™¬  Because the words which have not yet been said  remain  â™¬

549
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,530
â™¬  Because I cannot  â™¬

550
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,450
 Jackpot 
â™¬  live a time without you  â™¬

551
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,000
 - Who are you ?
- Where is this? 

552
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,300
 You don't even know the name?  I'm Seol Im.  Gye Seol Im. 

553
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,980
 The day you get caught running away from here will be the day you die. 

554
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,240
 You punk, again? Survive.  

555
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,480
 Wronged?  

556
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,380
 What are you waiting for?  Go capture the punk at once. 

557
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,400
 Go by yourself. 

558
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,520
 Is there a law that says a crown prince must be king?  

559
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,190
 Do you wish to be king?  Yes or no?  

560
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,300
 I'll concede the throne.  

561
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,050
 That idiot bastard is a gambling master?  

562
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,940
 How about a round?  With him as the wager.  

563
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,390
 - Baek Dae Gil? 
- Why did you kill my father!!
