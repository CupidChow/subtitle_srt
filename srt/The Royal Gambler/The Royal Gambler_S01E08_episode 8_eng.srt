 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,360
 Kim Che Geon 

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,240
Master...

5
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,100
With this much, you're done with the basics.

6
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,080
When you can cut a flower petal in half with your eyes closed, your training will be done.

7
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
When you can shoot through a coin, your training will be done.

8
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,920
When you can best me with a sword, your training will be done.

9
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,200
Back!

10
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,260
When you can do 1,000 push-ups, your training will be done.

11
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,020
At this rate, I won't even be able to do 100!

12
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,120
If you have enough strength to talk, do one more!

13
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,340
Three!

14
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,020
But Master, how many are there?

15
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,560
How many what?

16
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,340
People who are stronger than you.

17
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,400
People who are stronger than me? I don't think there is anyone in Joseon.

18
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,280
How could there not even be one?

19
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,560
There isn't, you bastard!

20
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Actually, there is one person.

21
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
He wasn't up to my level,

22
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,340
but this guy was almost up to my foot.

23
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,700
 He used to be a military officer who served the King, and his strength was great. 

24
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,760
 He can beat tigers with his bare hands. 

25
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,360
 Hwang Jin Gi 

26
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,940
Master, can you beat tigers with your bare hands?

27
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,680
Why wouldn't I use a sword when I have it, and foolishly attack a tiger with my bare hands?

28
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,460
Then what would you do if it confronted you when you were bare-handed?

29
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,280
Your stare.

30
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,000
You have to oppress it with your stare.

31
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,500
Even a tiger would piss itself with this kind of a stare.

32
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,140
Why? You don't believe me?

33
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,040
There are two people then. Two people I have to surpass.

34
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,580
Thank you very much.

35
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,220
Why are you here today?

36
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,680
I've brought some people to your house, My Lord.

37
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,940
It's probably ten times as much as this.

38
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,140
 Lee In Jwa 

39
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,900
My Lord. Please use your hands in the Royal Investigation Bureau.

40
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,320
Royal Investigation Bureau?

41
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,980
What's in there?

42
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,550
 A sword. 

43
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,950
 The sharpest and most dangerous sword in the world is in there. 

44
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
 Since you request it of me, 

45
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,440
  I will help you, but it will not be easy. 

46
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,680
If you go around back that way, it will lead you to the basement section of the prison.

47
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,300
Who are you guys?

48
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,640
My Lord is looking for you right now.

49
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,440
A Lord? Who is this Lord?

50
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
The White-Faced Scholar has sent us.

51
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,820
White-Faced Scholar? Lee In Jwa?

52
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,040
I need a sword.

53
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,720
Hey you! Where's my sword?

54
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,820
I'm an idiot for even asking.

55
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,880
Quickly!

56
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,640
What happened?

57
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,420
What the heck is going on?!

58
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,460
 All you need to do is just cover our backs, My Lord. 

59
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,740
But where is the White-Faced Scholar?

60
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,680
Are you looking for me?

61
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,600
Are you Lee In Jwa?

62
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,700
As I lived in jail, I couldn't sleep for worrying about my aging mother all alone.

63
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,870
You even held a funeral for her in place of this foolish child of hers. I am very grateful.

64
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,020
Tell me what you want. Anything at all.  If it is within my power,  I will do it.

65
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,460
From now on, you will have many things to do.

66
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,280
However, before that...

67
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,880
Please excuse me for what I'm about to do.

68
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,770
What is this for, you wielding a sword without any reason?

69
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,420
Well, the reason isn't important.

70
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,920
Will I get  a real taste of the blade after so long?

71
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,450
Enough.

72
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,980
Would you care to have a drink with me?

73
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,690
Drink?!  A drink is good!

74
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,950
I'm no slave girl.

75
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,140
Now they're even asking me to deliver them some drink? Damn it.

76
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,660
How important is your guest that you...

77
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,290
You must be really strong, eh?

78
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,380
Then, I'll see you next time.

79
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,370
Here. Eat.

80
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,150
Thank you.

81
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,990
The ruler is good-for-nothing, such a suffocating life.

82
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,950
So did you break the Ganghwa Gate out of rage?

83
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,410
Ah... Well... Since the gate was too strong, I couldn't break it.

84
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,580
Even so, a skilled man like you shouldn't have been caught so easily.

85
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,780
If only I hadn't drunk that day, really!

86
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,200
That's what happened. Drink is my enemy.

87
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,860
If I hadn't drunk that day, I would have done things to that guy.

88
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,610
Your job is to catch him.

89
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,580
The first man named as Joseon's Best Swordsman since the founding of the nation.

90
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,140
Slice his throat.

91
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,410
Hold your breath, hand under the chin, legs apart.

92
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,200
Give it to me.

93
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,450
Watch carefully.

94
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,900
Master, can you avoid a flying arrow?

95
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,080
Even at close range, can you evade an arrow?

96
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,790
Shoot.

97
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,390
Are you being serious?

98
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,530
No matter how you train, arms and legs can't be faster than human instinct.

99
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,250
However, there is one thing that is faster than that instinct.

100
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,330
How did you do that?

101
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,840
The thing that moves faster than instinct in a human body is...

102
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,030
the gaze.

103
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,090
Your gaze.

104
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,400
Gaze?

105
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,700
What's your purpose in being my disciple?

106
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,760
My purpose?

107
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,590
Of course it is to get that Lee In Jwa's head...

108
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,140
Then, get off the mountain immediately.

109
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:38,230
With your current skills, you should be able to pluck the likes of his head off in the middle of the night.

110
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,080
At the salt merchant's house,

111
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,320
what do you suppose was the reason I decided to accept you as my disciple?

112
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,900
I told you this. Vermin like Lee In Jwa

113
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,170
won't be eradicated no matter how hard you try.

114
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,070
 Look at these vermin. 

115
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,700
 They will not be eradicated just because you step up alone. 

116
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,910
 No, I'm not alone. 

117
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,430
 These... 

118
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,100
 These... These bastards. 

119
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,750
You've already received a lesson no money can buy.

120
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,540
But you still only amount to this?

121
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,890
 I will wait. 

122
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,870
 Until you become a Great Tiger and appear. 

123
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,860
 Find a bigger, more grand meaning, and become a Great Tiger. 

124
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,810
 It's useless to be a royal offspring to start off with. 

125
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,050
 If you want to shed that shell of hypocrisy... 

126
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,990
 I will have you grip the sword. 

127
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,170
 The heirloom treasure sword. 

128
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:07,200
 Just wait.  The time will come soon. 

129
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,230
Your Highness! Your Highness!

130
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,500
There was a prison escape last night.

131
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,770
Who was the criminal in the jail break?

132
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,210
It was Royal Messenger Hwang Jin Gi.

133
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,560
Hwang Jin Gi?

134
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,880
And we found this sealed letter in the jail.

135
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,190
 Your Highness. You must have heard the news from last night. 

136
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,640
  I want to see you for a little while.  

137
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,530
  Please spare some time for me. 

138
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,850
Excuse me.

139
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,720
Excuse us for passing by.

140
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,590
Unni!  (older sister) 

141
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,240
- Unni!
  - Why is she lying down? What happened to her? 

142
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,940
Aigoo. She stole the floral leather shoes and got caught.

143
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,140
 Aigoo. 

144
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,430
What happened, then?

145
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,080
Aigoo, what will happen to that little girl then?

146
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,860
Unni!

147
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,560
Unni!

148
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,950
Why did you help the traitor Hwang Jin Gi escape from prison?

149
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,530
You took him, what are you going to use him for?

150
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,610
Your Highness, are you afraid of his sword, too?

151
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,920
Do you think I am afraid of just one sword?

152
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,060
What if it's not only one sword?

153
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,060
Your Highness, on your way coming here

154
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,780
weren't you bothered at all?

155
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I am warning you now, Your Highness.

156
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,940
It's not that you don't kill me

157
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,890
but that you can't kill me.

158
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,540
The person that I fear most in this world

159
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,290
is in fact the one you fear as well.

160
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,210
I'm talking about my Royal Father.

161
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,600
I don't deny that.

162
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,790
The king is a real monster.

163
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,890
That's why I have become a monster as well.

164
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,790
To surpass the King.

165
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,880
I, who have become a monster,

166
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,250
do you think you can stop me, Your Highness?

167
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,400
Just wait.

168
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,960
You won't have to wait too long.

169
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,030
Then don't just sit there and watch.

170
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,100
How about you and I

171
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,040
fight each other risking our lives today?

172
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,060
Your Highness.

173
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,400
The Tiger Sword cuts the Seven-Star Sword.

174
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,150
The Seven-Star Sword cuts the  Military Sword.

175
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,340
The Military Sword cuts the Ceremonial Sword.

176
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,950
The Ceremonial Sword cuts the Civil Sword and the Civil Sword cuts the Wooden Sword.

177
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,640
How about it?

178
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,860
Today, with me, Lee In Jwa,

179
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,990
will you play one game on those swords?

180
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,920
Fine. Then on this spot,

181
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,380
let's test your fate and mine.

182
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,310
You want to hold a real sword?

183
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,920
Try holding it.

184
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,580
  It's the Tiger Sword. 

185
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,350
 Is it the Wooden Sword? 

186
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,830
More than the sword,

187
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,710
the quality of  the person holding the sword matters.

188
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,590
This is the gap between you and me.

189
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,670
With that kind of ability, before you could even catch a beast,

190
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,780
your body would be slaughtered first by its paws.

191
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,960
Lee In Jwa.

192
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,210
Lee In Jwa.

193
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:57,310
Your Highness Prince,  the King's sword still seems too heavy for you.

194
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,550
Accompany the Prince back to the palace.

195
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,620
Halt.

196
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,960
I said to halt right there!

197
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,230
What is it?

198
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,990
Did such a small incident as this

199
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,890
hurt your pride

200
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,670
and make you feel unfairly wronged?

201
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,470
What do you really want to say to me?

202
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,270
Can you not see?

203
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,300
Does Your Highness

204
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,910
not hear the cries and see the blood of your subjects?!

205
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,030
Unni!

206
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,610
Unni!

207
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,000
Unni!

208
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,460
Unni!

209
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,660
Unni!

210
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,910
Just for stealing a pair of floral leather shoes,

211
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,070
a girl was killed.

212
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,450
Does Your Highness really not see the injustice here?

213
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,850
You are rushing.

214
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,510
I can see why you are frustrated.

215
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,380
And you must feel as if you can't even set one foot out of here.

216
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,840
Your father Yi Soo felt the same way.

217
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,130
However, Dam Seo,

218
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,550
it's not like you can achieve your revenge, then the great cause,

219
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,240
but you can achieve your revenge in achieving the great cause.

220
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,130
But—

221
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,980
I see.

222
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,700
I believe it's okay to try a little bit.

223
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,400
Try to influence Prince Yeoning and make him act.

224
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,820
Take care of this well.

225
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,900
Ah... yes, Sir.

226
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm sorry.  When you become an adult,

227
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,010
I hope the world will be a better place.

228
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,790
Please forgive me.

229
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:28,150
Please forgive me who can only do this much.

230
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,800
What is it now? Are you here to nag at me again?

231
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,080
It's a little too late, but you've done a good deed.

232
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,230
Why? Do I look pitiful?

233
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,320
Stop wasting my time, and tell me what you really want.

234
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,320
You have such a twisted mind.

235
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,910
- What did you say? 
 - It's not like I was speaking ill of you.

236
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,330
But that's what it looks like. The way you really view me.

237
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,820
Please look into my eyes.

238
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,350
Can you really see my heart?

239
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:09,270
If there is something I want, will you be able to heed my request?

240
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,060
A tour of the palace?

241
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,610
I do believe you've been here before.

242
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,930
Let's go back now.

243
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,340
We can't go that way.

244
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,090
Don't you know?

245
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,380
That way is where my Royal Mother  (Sook Bin)  lives.

246
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,570
Then I must at least greet her properly.

247
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,350
I have met her before.

248
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,900
You are really pretty.

249
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,930
So what brings you here?

250
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,590
The prince is giving me a tour of the palace.

251
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,350
It just happened that way.

252
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,770
We ladies need to talk, so please step outside.

253
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,770
- But— 
- Go on.

254
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
What is your reason

255
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,520
for sticking so closely to the prince and coming to see me?

256
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,560
You know why.

257
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,740
The supporter of the Crown Prince—

258
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,720
- No way. 
 - Yes...

259
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,540
He is my teacher now.

260
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,980
You wench. How dare you come here?

261
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,230
I know Lady Sook Bin's past as well.

262
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,800
Your hidden son, and even his father, Baek Man Geum.

263
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,560
I know every little detail.

264
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,860
What do you want from me?

265
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:16,340
Let me meet His Majesty the King.

266
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,180
His Majesty?

267
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,880
What's the reason for this?

268
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:29,120
Your Highness, my father's name is Kim Yi Soo.

269
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,080
You are the daughter of General Kim?

270
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Yes.

271
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,760
He used to escort His Majesty and was killed by His Majesty.

272
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,240
That very person was my father.

273
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,820
 Please exchange it. 

274
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,340
 Please exchange this child for a child who died of the plague. 

275
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,150
 I am begging you. 

276
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,760
 Don't you also have a daughter? 

277
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,900
 Foolish wench. 

278
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,950
 Your provocative behavior has cost the innocent General Kim his life. 

279
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,830
I am indebted to him.

280
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:19,400
But what do you mean General Kim was killed by the King?

281
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,760
What evidence do you have to dare accuse the King of this crime?

282
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,650
Did you see it with your own two eyes?

283
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,530
Since it's something that happened a long time ago, I have no evidence, but—

284
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,000
With no evidence, how do you know of it?

285
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,370
Is that what your teacher told you?

286
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:41,310
That the King killed your father?

287
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:48,540
Not all people who are raised by beasts become beasts.

288
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,020
By any chance, with that gaze of yours, which I can read so easily,

289
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,390
what do you think you can do to His Majesty?

290
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,030
Have you ever seen His Majesty?

291
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,350
Even once?

292
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,130
I'm asking if you've ever met the king even once.

293
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,050
I guarantee you this.

294
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,150
You won't even be able to breathe.

295
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,840
Prince Yeoning, are you outside right now?

296
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,890
 Yes, Royal Mother. 

297
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,540
His Majesty is with Prince Yeonryeong right now.

298
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,180
Since she wants to see His Majesty, even from afar,

299
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,260
Prince, you guide her there.

300
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,820
Yes, Royal Mother.

301
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,530
  What do you mean General Kim was killed by the King? 

302
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,890
 Is that what your teacher told you? 

303
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,570
 Never forget, 

304
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,470
 and never forgive. 

305
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,630
 That a wretched person, who is even worse than an animal,  

306
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:25,730
  is this country's King. 

307
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,530
What are you brooding about?

308
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,180
He is over there.

309
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,700
 Was it you? 

310
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,290
 The person who killed my father. 

311
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,190
Would you like to go and greet my Royal Father?

312
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,440
 Just confirm what he looks like. 

313
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,620
 Get familiar with the layout of the palace  by luring Prince Yeoning. 

314
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,640
 And just confirm how the king looks. 

315
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:31,300
  Except for that, you can't do any heedless things. Do you understand? 

316
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,390
No, thank you. I think I'm done for—

317
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,940
What do you mean "no"? This was a difficult opportunity I had to arrange.

318
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,910
So you should at least give your greetings to him.

319
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,730
Royal Father!

320
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,370
Your Highness!

321
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,350
Royal Father!

322
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,080
Royal Brother!

323
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,470
 Prince Yeonryeong (Yi Hwon, King Sookjong's sixth son) 

324
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,820
Have you been well, Royal Brother?

325
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,320
Yes.

326
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,890
Who is she?

327
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,730
I am Kim So Yool.

328
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,790
-  So Yool? 
- You have a pretty name.

329
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,770
By the way, you look familiar.

330
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,760
Among my most cherished friends,

331
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,430
there is a military officer whose name was Yi Soo.

332
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,550
You look like that person very much.

333
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,770
I seem to recall he also had a daughter about your age.

334
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:01,920
Her name was Dam Seo, was it?

335
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,030
 Five steps.  The King is only five steps away. 

336
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:19,850
 The one person that I have most wanted to kill is only five steps away. 

337
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,260
 Have you ever seen His Majesty? 

338
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,450
 I guarantee you this.  You won't even be able to breathe. 

339
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,800
Why is your face looking so uneasy?

340
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,440
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

341
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,480
Put out your hand.

342
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,710
You two are well-suited.

343
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,540
Very well-suited.

344
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,020
Hwon, let us go for a stroll.

345
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,840
So you are Deputy Kim Yi Soo's daughter?

346
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,280
What an unreasonable thing to say.

347
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,000
You couldn't have

348
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:17,010
thought Father King didn't know, or did you think he brought up General Kim

349
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,080
as a coincidence?

350
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,940
What about it?

351
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,380
What has changed?

352
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:30,700
If you believe my father killed your father, you are wrong.

353
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:35,520
And do you have evidence to think otherwise?

354
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:42,870
Father King's gaze in recollecting General Kim.  You also saw it.

355
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:49,070
 Among my most cherished friends, 

356
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,580
 there was a military officer by the name of Yi Soo. 

357
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:01,190
You've misunderstood, under the falsehoods of Lee In Jwa.

358
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:08,600
No. It couldn't be a misunderstanding or a lie.

359
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,020
And it must never be so.

360
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,520
Then I shall take my leave...

361
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,180
Have you seen him?

362
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,700
Yes.

363
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:36,290
So how is the king's royal countenance?

364
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:42,640
 You've misunderstood, under the falsehoods of Lee In Jwa. 

365
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,940
I am wavering.

366
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:54,150
I am wavering, Sir.

367
00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:00,840
 What I believed to be true is no longer true. 

368
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,850
 What I deemed  irrelevant to me is  no longer irrelevant. 

369
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,830
I have become fatigued from waiting.

370
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,450
Grant me permission, Sir.

371
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,740
Before I crumble from this,

372
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,750
I wish to draw the sword.

373
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,240
Can you accomplish it alone?

374
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,050
Then do as you wish.

375
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,660
Do you mean it?

376
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,350
Have you ever seen me repeat what I said?

377
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,310
 Eight 

378
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:10,230
 When given a gambling tag, you wager everything on the one tag in your hand. 

379
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,980
 Six 

380
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,940
 Six, six 

381
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,920
 Six, six, six. 

382
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,580
 If you take up the sword, that sword and your fate become one. 

383
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,510
 The only thing you can believe in 

384
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:37,340
 is the one tag in your hand, the one sword, and nothing else. 

385
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,590
 Whether it is martial arts or gambling, once you master it, 

386
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:05,190
 you will see they are not so different. 

387
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,240
 From now on, remember these three things. 

388
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,500
 First is breathing. When the sharp blade reaches the flesh, 

389
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,420
 and the smell of blood starts, 

390
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,570
 your desire to live will cause your breathing to become diffuse. 

391
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,780
 The moment your breathing begins to become diffuse, 

392
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,730
 the opponent's blade will pierce your body. 

393
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,480
 However, if you seek to die you will live. 

394
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,480
 You must free yourself from your desire to win and live. 

395
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,810
 That's when you will finally hear it. 

396
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:47,490
 The sound of your opponent's sword.  The sound of your opponent's heart. 

397
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:16,300
The second is the gaze. Your life and death hang on the gaze, so you must read the gaze.

398
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,300
First is breathing and second is gaze.

399
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,500
Then what's third?

400
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,580
- Audacity. 
 - Audacity?

401
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,030
But don't worry about it.

402
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:02,790
You were going to pounce at the tiger with just a rod, so in audacity, you are Joseon's most audacious.

403
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,410
Master, then am I all done with the training now?

404
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:12,440
Didn't I tell you?  Slash the pedal, pierce the bronze coin or beat me before you can leave the mountain.

405
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,650
Stop the dog talk and let's get out, for a change.

406
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,150
Outside?

407
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,660
This one!

408
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,880
This one! And this one!

409
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,760
Oh my, thank you so much sir!

410
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,680
- And also this one! 
 - Oh my! Thank you so much once again, sir!

411
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,980
Wait, you're going to buy all of these?

412
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,740
Don't worry about it, you bastard. I'm going to eat it all myself!

413
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,600
And you're not even going to carry it yourself. Okay, hurry up and give it to me quickly.

414
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,760
This is good. Let's go.

415
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,600
 Buy some. 

416
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,900
Buy some.

417
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,040
So this is why he brought me.

418
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,180
Take this!

419
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,120
How long has it been since I last saw some meat? Thank you!

420
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,820
 Aigoo, look at that. 

421
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,780
Get out of the way.

422
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,780
Hey what are you doing? Hurry up!

423
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,420
If there is something you want to say, spit it out.

424
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,640
I thought it was strange.

425
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,820
A master swordsman like you, living in this shabby little town.

426
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,960
Who exactly are you, Master?

427
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:09,460
Bureau of Military Training, Captain Kim Che Geon?

428
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,040
At one point in my life, I was also a military officer who served the king.

429
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:19,820
I even pledged my life to serve this country. But then...

430
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:36,080
 Hey, Jin Gi. Since your skills are better than most, I'm sure you'll hear good news this time. 

431
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,440
 Thank you. 

432
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,520
 - Officer of Veterans, Shin Gil Soo. 
 - Yes, Sir! 

433
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,680
 - Officer of Military, Lee Dong Joon. 
 - Yes, Sir! 

434
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,380
 - Officer of Bravery (8th rank), Choi Eun Gi. 

435
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,580
 - Officer of Justice (7th rank), Lee Jae Heon. 

436
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,420
 - Officer of Construction, Bang Gyeong Won.
 - Yes, Sir! 

437
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,420
 - Officer of Veterans, Jeong Tae Hoon. 
 - Yes, Sir! 

438
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,080
 That's all. 

439
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,220
 My Lord. I think there is one officer you left out. 

440
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,740
 Left out? 

441
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,440
 Was there not the name, "Hwang Jin Gi" in there? 

442
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,520
 Isn't he the one without any sponsor? There's no need for me look again. 

443
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:37,480
 The unfair treatment would always repeat itself year after year, and the corruption of the court would never cease. 

444
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,000
  So I could no longer stay in the palace. 

445
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,900
And then what? You became a traitor?

446
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:50,400
I plan to kill the king. Just like you have your own reasons, I too, have my own reasons.

447
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,200
So don't think about stopping me.

448
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:02,820
"Hear my words! The King whom you serve...

449
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,980
The King whom you serve, deserves death,

450
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,900
s-so I personally plan to kill him.

451
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:17,040
This will take place on Cheongmyeong (April 5th) during the hour of Jashi (11 PM to 1 AM), and if you think you can stop me, go ahead and try."

452
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,550
Even a month prior, we'd already started to investigate  assassination attempts, 
 Crown Prince Yoon 

453
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,560
including Suyang Palace, Bohun Pavilion and even Haeyeong Palace.

454
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,240
There have been signs that assassins have broken into the palace.

455
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,720
Your Majesty, isn't today Cheongmyeong (April 5th)?

456
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,180
You're right. Since this issue has become urgent—

457
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,120
What are you all worrying about?

458
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,480
Hm?

459
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:55,620
Since they were kind of enough to tell us the date and even the time, what are you all scared about? Hm?

460
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,800
- Minister of Defense. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

461
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,240
- Royal Guards. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

462
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,620
- Royal Investigation Bureau. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

463
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,080
- Bureau of Police. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

464
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,100
Are you really so lacking in confidence?

465
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,780
You pathetic kids.

466
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:21,680
Your Majesty, your son will utilize the Five Military Defense Bureaus and the Royal Guards so that no harm will befall you.

467
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,400
No.

468
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,760
There is no need for you to do that.

469
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,900
You mustn't do this, Your Majesty!

470
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:39,440
How could you give such a crucial task to your son?

471
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,440
Did you not say that you would become my sword?

472
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:52,520
 Your son, instead of wearing the crown, will hold the sword. 

473
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,840
 I will cut the arms and legs of the corrupt officials who torment the people, 

474
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,960
 and I will also catch the traitors to the king, 

475
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,800
 and I will be the first to open the road 

476
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,000
 which you, the king, must take. 

477
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,440
But even so, Your Majesty!

478
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,740
It's Saingeom (Four-Tiger Sword).

479
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:28,440
Your Majesty, this sword is too heavy for your son.

480
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:34,380
If you're not confident of protecting me with that sword,

481
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,980
then you will not be able to protect anything,

482
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,520
including yourself.

483
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,780
 Father... 

484
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,560
Have you prepared yourself?

485
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,500
 Remove the sheath and throw it away. 

486
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:40,380
 I'm telling you to wield that sword as much as you want. 

487
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,720
 If I stop you... 

488
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,400
What will you do if I try to stop you?

489
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,860
Then one of us will die.
