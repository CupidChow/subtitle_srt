3
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,250
 King Gyeongjong (Joseon's 20th king) 

4
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Though there is no way to express our sadness over the former king's passing  (Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip) 

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,600
the position of taking care of the nation's people, the throne,

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,700
 cannot be left vacant for long. 

7
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,730
 For this nation's vitality and to continue proper administration, 

8
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,810
Crown Prince Yi Yoon will be the newly appointed King.

9
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,300
Hurrah.

10
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,370
Ten thousand years

11
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,040
Hurrah again.

12
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:41,240
Thousands of thousands of years.

13
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,780
 Prince Yeoning (future King Yeongjo) 

14
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,210
What is it?

15
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,480
Think it through and speak.

16
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,700
That life of yours could possibly be spared, depending on your answer.

17
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,880
 Jeong Hee Ryang 

18
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,020
So it is evidence to catch Yi In Jwa that you seek.

19
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,390
Someone like you who is more suspicious than anyone else,

20
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,100
you wouldn't have  joined an alliance with Yi In Jwa without any cause.

21
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,740
Where is it? The proof of your alliance.

22
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,650
WHY SHOULD I

23
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,920
give you my lifeline to you?

24
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,360
So you do have one (a cause).

25
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,450
Want to bet whether I'll find it or not?

26
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,140
 Gyeongjong (Joseon's 20th king) 

27
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,920
Your humble subject is deeply moved

28
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,950
to be in an audience with Your Majesty ensconced on the throne.

29
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,260
You have kept your promise.

30
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,150
 I will protect Your Highness the Crown Prince. 

31
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,610
 I will give you all.  If you will protect me. 

32
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,050
 Everything I have. 

33
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,500
 Even if that is, if that is, 

34
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,680
 the royal throne. 

35
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,610
You said this to me at the time.

36
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,220
That you'd only take my heartfelt thought.

37
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,340
Your feeling.  Is it the same now?

38
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,220
Your Majesty, my mind when I swore to protect Your Majesty

39
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,220
has not changed one bit.

40
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,750
I can wager my life swearing on it.

41
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,830
Thank you.  You may leave now.

42
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,660
Bullseye.

43
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,680
Will you wager with me as well?

44
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,330
Why? Jeong Hee Ryang is fine

45
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,940
but I'm not.

46
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,140
Bullseye.

47
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,100
If you win, I will buy you a drink

48
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,150
and grant you a wish.

49
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,540
However, if you lose...

50
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,470
 One of the Jong royal bloodline has ended, 

51
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,760
-   so only three remain. 
 - Baek Dae Gil. 

52
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,620
Lay bare your truth.

53
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,260
Where did this entanglement start?

54
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,440
Do you really think I am interested in the royal throne?

55
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,690
Well, are you not?

56
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,410
There are things in this world that must be done even if you don't desire to,

57
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,240
if it is what the people want.

58
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,840
Have you the confidence you can still decline it then?  The royal throne.

59
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,230
Royal throne.  King. Tell me.

60
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,080
What exactly is a king?

61
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,580
The king is the father of the people.

62
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,070
The nation's foundation. The unwavering root.

63
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,940
- And for the sake of the people, spending his entire lifeâ€”
 - The foundation of the nation is the people.

64
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,720
And for the people to be unwavering, they need to eat and live well.

65
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,280
Look.  This sumptuous feast. Those who are one footstep away from death.

66
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,620
Their images haunt me dozens and hundreds of times, and I can't eat.

67
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,630
Did I not say it? It is the king's lot to worry over the people.

68
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,490
That's why you covered up Prince Yeonryeong's death?

69
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,580
For the people? In order to promote national stability?

70
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,000
Do not speak of it so lightly.

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,190
I have given it hundreds and thousands of thoughts.

72
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,070
 When I shoot my arrows,  

73
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,180
 am I to lose as a subject,  

74
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,940
  to lose as brother? 

75
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,330
But I had to win.

76
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,490
I have a wish I want you to grant for winning.

77
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,650
Bullseye.

78
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,920
What is it? Your wish.

79
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,860
Trust me.

80
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,210
Not for my sake, but for your sake. That is my wish.

81
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,590
And from now on, I plan to show my respect as your subject.

82
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,100
 I can't grant you that wish. 

83
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,840
  I can't trust you is what I'm saying. 

84
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,780
What?  Your heart feels numb?

85
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,880
A trivial distrust in your heart
 Kim Che Geon 

86
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,760
will become a large calamity.

87
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,320
When you fight, don't turn back with doubts.

88
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,880
I know.

89
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,900
It's nothing for someone like me who has nothing to lose.

90
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,070
But I suppose that isn't the case for His Highness, who has a lot to lose.

91
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,460
What is your plan now?

92
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,260
What else?

93
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,640
I need to catch him.

94
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,010
His Majesty has ascended to the throne,

95
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,850
and it is now your lordship's world.

96
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,200
We're back, My Liege.

97
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,720
How did it go?

98
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,700
We ransacked Jeong's mountain lodge inside and out.

99
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,170
No.
 Hwang Jin Gi 

100
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,240
But we failed to find the blood pledge.

101
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,840
Of course, Master Jeong is not so slipshod.

102
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,680
His life hangs from this rope, so he must be clenching it tightly with both hands.

103
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,780
Welcome.

104
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,800
You trusted Baek Dae Gil too much and courted calamity.

105
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,260
You don't seem to be all that trustworthy a person either.

106
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,910
I'd love to release you at once, but I have no justification.

107
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,510
Do you plan to abandon me?

108
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,500
Did you forget? We have shared blood.

109
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,930
I will think of a way to have you released somehow. So please wait.

110
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,370
I can't give you the blood pledge.

111
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,890
In case you let go of my hand,

112
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,610
that blood pledge will become my lifeline.

113
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,440
That pains me,

114
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,240
how you speak those words to me.

115
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,240
Give me a farthing. Give me a farthing.

116
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,960
 Remember. If you want to see me,  

117
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,140
 take this to the beggar in the market streets. Understand? 

118
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,980
Give me a farthing.  Give me a farthing.

119
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:34,230
 Hong Mae is a dim-witted wench but be careful of Mother Hwanggu. 

120
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,790
 She can see the spirits too. 

121
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,250
 Watch out for Yi In Jwa especially. 

122
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,350
 Not even a minor error can be acceptable. Got that? 

123
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,040
Sister!

124
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
What? A guest is here?

125
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Not a guest, but a wretch.

126
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,560
Huh?

127
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,200
Boss Hong, have you been well?

128
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,860
The gambling den is pretty slack.

129
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,480
That's because the nation is in this bad predicament.

130
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,500
You betrayed me to save yourself,

131
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,160
just to suck your fingers?

132
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,400
That's my business. Did you ever scoop a meal for me?

133
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,640
Just state your business and go.

134
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,430
Did you already forget?

135
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,750
I clearly said if you did three things for me,

136
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,930
I promised to return this gambling den to you.

137
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,430
Was that some promise I wanted to make?

138
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,890
You half-forced me to do it after striking all sorts of swindles and swallowing my den.

139
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,140
Where is it? The blood pledge Jeong placed in your care.

140
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,430
 Take care of it for me. 

141
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,910
 What is it? 

142
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,770
 A strong rope. 

143
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,370
 You have many grievances against Yi In Jwa, right? 

144
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,460
 Since he's made a gambler den boss into a lowly errand runner.  

145
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,060
 Disgusting.  

146
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,140
 As long as you have this blood pledge that can pluck Yi In Jwa's neck,  

147
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,400
 this rope, will you grip it or not? 

148
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,070
I'll pay you a handsome amount for it.

149
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,730
Your Lordship's lifeline hangs on that blood pledge?

150
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,150
Money doesn't talk anymore.

151
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,500
You seem deluded.

152
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,180
What this means is, if you cough up the blood pledge, I will spare you.

153
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:45,300
Then I will give you until tomorrow.

154
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,050
Hong Mae?

155
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,570
Yi In Jwa met Hong Mae.

156
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:16,590
I thought their relationship ended after Yi In Jwa was jailed.

157
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,470
At any rate, thank you.  Is Father well?

158
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,650
When the work is done, go to the place that is written there.

159
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,710
You can meet Chief Man Geum there.

160
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,590
Nice to meet you.

161
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,740
You've entered the royal palace.

162
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,260
It's a pleasure to see you like this, Special Cavalry Officer Baek Dae Gil.

163
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,920
Enjoy all you want, but your wings will soon be snapped.

164
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,710
I have made plans for the ages.

165
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,250
Prepare yourself.

166
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,650
Prepare to be king.

167
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,170
So we've all gathered in one place like this.

168
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,510
Is it time?

169
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,800
I will mobilize on your order.

170
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,090
Come in.

171
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,010
I should have acknowledged your merit sooner.

172
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,830
I am a bit late.

173
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,130
Your Majesty. I am not qualified to receive a government position.

174
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,330
You don't think you're qualified?

175
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,000
Your humility is abundant. When you could have ambition for a bigger position

176
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,710
than a lowly special cavalry officer.

177
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,520
It is because I failed to capture the man who conspired to commit treason with the traitor Jeong.

178
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,540
Yes, it is Yi In Jwa.

179
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,300
Are you sure? Can you be responsible for what you say?

180
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,520
How would I dare to speak false words during an audience?

181
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
Your subject will surely find the evidence.

182
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,580
Yi In Jwa is my teacher.

183
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,300
If Yi In Jwa was not involved in treason,

184
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,720
you will have to pay with your life for the crime of holding the royal throne in contempt.

185
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,740
I will bear what you say  in mind,  Your Majesty.

186
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,040
Before Royal Father ascended to Heaven, he held a private audience with you, I heard.

187
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,980
Yes, I met him.

188
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,760
 Baek Dae Gil. 

189
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:37,560
Your Majesty, please postpone the traitor Jeong's punishment for the time being.

190
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,520
To allow Yi In Jwa to show his tail.

191
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,280
 Yi In Jwa. 

192
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,340
So what is your reason?

193
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,900
The reason your humble subject came to Your Majesty's audience today is for the sake of Prince Yeoning.

194
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,500
Prince Yeoning?

195
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,960
Seje (Royal Successor Brother as Crown Prince).

196
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
 Seje = Crown Prince. 

197
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,200
Install Prince Yeoning as Crown Prince? For what reason?

198
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,020
Your Majesty has no heir.

199
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,700
Hence, the Noron ministers will seek to have Prince Yeoning installed as Crown Prince.

200
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,580
Give them what they want.

201
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:49,780
Then you can separate the foes clearly.

202
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,460
This is the most suitable timing right now.

203
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,880
His Majesty's health is dwindling by the day.

204
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,280
He also has  no heir, so the Crown Princeâ€”

205
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,640
Crown Prince Installation.

206
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
Where do you think you are!

207
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,380
That should be done. The installation of a crown prince.

208
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,800
I will assist you.

209
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,260
Your offering of goodwill makes me wary.

210
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,700
The judgment is for you ministers to render. Well...

211
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,840
Your Excellency, isn't this an opportunity?

212
00:23:52,360 --> 00:24:00,140
His Majesty has no heir. Hence he's deemed Noron to be in favor of power.

213
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,720
Yi In Jwa's intention seems untrustworthy.

214
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,140
Why do you falter? Let's push forward with it.

215
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,020
Installing the royal brother as the crown prince. There is more than abundant justification.

216
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,140
Hence I will give it a try.

217
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,280
Your humble subject seeks to bring to Your Majesty today

218
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,000
a matter of utmost importance on which the survival of the nation depends.

219
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,760
Are you speaking of crowning the royal brother as the crown prince?

220
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,840
I understand, since my health isn't faring well and I have no heir.

221
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,800
Your Majesty.

222
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,660
What is your thought, Prince Yeoning?

223
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,760
Your humble subjectâ€”

224
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,300
Your Majesty. Expedite installation of the Crown Prince

225
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,060
and plan for a successor.

226
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,140
It is not possible, Your Majesty.

227
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,440
Your Majesty is in the prime of youth.  Installation of royal brother as Crown Prince?

228
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,620
This can't be.

229
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:33,800
In the case of a monarchy without a successor installed, that is only for barbaric nations without foundations.

230
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,820
This nation Joseon is a patient Confucian state with roots.

231
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,980
How can you teach His Majesty the way of the barbarians?

232
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,560
What did you just say?

233
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,500
Do it.

234
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,460
Your Majesty.

235
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,240
I will install Prince Yeoning to be Royal Prince Successor Brother (Crown Prince).

236
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,920
Your Majesty. You mustn't.

237
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,500
You mustn't.

238
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,840
You mustn't, Your Majesty.
 Choi In Seok, Cho Il Soo 

239
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,940
You mustn't.

240
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,520
Your Majesty.

241
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,060
You mustn't.

242
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,860
You mustn't.

243
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,280
Take it.

244
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,000
But you won't change your tune after taking this blood pledge, will you?

245
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,880
 Hong Mae is no longer my person.  Kill her. 

246
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,840
What the heck is this now?

247
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,940
I'm sorry.

248
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,840
Baek Dae Gil.

249
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,940
Is a human life such a laugh to you?

250
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,180
You bastards! Stop bullying me, you rotten wretches!

251
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:04,060
Yeah, I don't need the gambling den or anything, so let's see the end of this.

252
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,720
The blood pledge was burned and is gone?

253
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,920
Yes.

254
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,520
Boss Hong has quite a tenacious lifeline.

255
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,800
It's fine this way,

256
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,560
since I was going to destroy it anyway.

257
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,040
It spared my hand.

258
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,200
Are you inside?

259
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,380
What brings you here, Your Excellency?

260
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,980
Was that you? The one who moved His Majesty.

261
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:12,900
What is your reason? I can't seem to figure out your gain.

262
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:20,200
Your Excellency, gathered heads become a herd of beasts.

263
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,640
Then one prey doesn't satisfy and instinct comes out.

264
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,500
That beast is Noron?

265
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,460
We know greed has no end. The craving for more and more will continue

266
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,740
without knowing life or death.

267
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:51,140
I will command. I have received a great awakening. Considering the heavens and the Confucian duties,

268
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,300
it is necessary to appropriately install an heir successor.

269
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,280
I bestow onto Prince Yeoning, Yi Geum,

270
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,340
the title of Crown Prince.

271
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,680
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

272
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,580
Your grace is immeasurable.

273
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,960
Your Highness, I offer my sincere congratulations.

274
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,740
Congratulations

275
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,960
Truly, my heart is heavy.

276
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,900
Since your position has changed, the responsibility is tremendous.

277
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,540
Isn't that the weight that you must continue to bear on your shoulders?

278
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,340
 When the work is done, go to the place that is written there. You will be able to meet Merchant Man Geum. 

279
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,550
Oh, is that so?

280
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,420
Isn't that Sire?

281
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,180
Yes it is. Sire Baek Dae Gil has arrived.

282
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,070
Sir! Sir!

283
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,470
I'm really glad!

284
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,110
Sir Baek Dae Gil! Sir!

285
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,180
Aigoo! Sir Baek Dae Gil!

286
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,900
Sir!

287
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,360
Nice to meet you, Sir!

288
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,750
Sir!

289
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,190
You have finally come!

290
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,570
You're here.

291
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,220
Father.

292
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,210
- Play nicely with one another. 
 - Yes!

293
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,980
They all will become your subjects.

294
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,150
You saved up so that those people could eat and survive?

295
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,540
Why would I create that difficulty for myself?

296
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,040
They're not ones to come if I asked, either.

297
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,290
To those people you are their savior,

298
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,210
because you were the one that let those whom the nation abandoned live.

299
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,910
Now you get it, right? What I meant when I said your life isn't just your own.

300
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,710
Father, I have no desire in my heart to become such a thing as a King.

301
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,590
Turn those people away.

302
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,120
They don't exactly have anywhere to go and they're not ones to leave because you tell them to.

303
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,330
Then. You want me to create an act of treason or something?

304
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,680
What can be done? It says it's in your fate.

305
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,690
Says who? Yi In Jwa?

306
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,480
No Oldman Southern Goblin said so.

307
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,070
What?

308
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:39,380
It's a joke. You know very well that you are of royal blood, right?

309
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,790
So what. What are you doing here, Father?

310
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,690
Did you gather all those people to rob or something?

311
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,320
You really. Though I may look like this, your father

312
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,470
is the Head of the Provincial Merchant League of the eight provinces.

313
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,160
In the Honam Region (present-day Jeolla Province), there's a man with the surname Park.

314
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,300
I am chasing after that guy.

315
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,580
Clansman Park in Honam?

316
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,870
That guy is the other half of that animal, Yi In Jwa.

317
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,840
There was such a guy?

318
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,760
Until he rears his head,

319
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,940
this has to remain an absolute secret. Got it?

320
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,570
 Carry it well and don't drop it. 

321
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,690
 Aigoo. You are going far away. 

322
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,190
Thank you, Father.

323
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,250
Aigoo, Sir. Come again, Sir.

324
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,780
Aigoo, Sir. Thank you.

325
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,030
Have a safe trip!

326
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,090
Seeing that things have sorted themselves out more easily than expected,

327
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,950
doesn't it make you anxious?

328
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,640
The height of power has shifted in our favor.

329
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,360
They say to strike while the iron is hot.

330
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,030
Let's go ahead and push a regency on him.

331
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,100
- Let's do so. If we ride this wave outâ€“ 
 - Tsk, tsk...

332
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,090
Don't act recklessly. Be reserved in your speech and actions.

333
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,350
At a time when His Majesty's condition is worsening by the day,

334
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm saying don't interfere and make trouble.

335
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,750
That is exactly why a regency is urgently needed.

336
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,140
That's right. When will we receive another such opportunity?

337
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,160
Don't forget. If you become drunk on the easy wind, you'll be hit with a strong opposing wind.

338
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,300
What do you mean regency?

339
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,100
His Majesty has just made a great decisive measure  in the installation of the Crown Prince.

340
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,710
How can you suggest a regency?

341
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,410
Though there was some noise temporarily,

342
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,650
I told them to reflect and be withdrawn.

343
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,860
Don't worry.

344
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,720
The Crown Prince appointment itself was too early.

345
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,790
Don't say those weak things.

346
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,730
His Majesty is gravely ill. He has no heir.

347
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,470
Someday, Your Highness will become a strong king

348
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,750
and sit on that throne.

349
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,300
I had promised the late Highness Royal Noble Consort Sook

350
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,880
that I would firmly protect you, Your Highness.

351
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:49,020
I, Kim Chang Jip, will certainly keep my promise to Her Highness.

352
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,580
Your Excellency

353
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,790
Your Highness, believe in me, Kim Chang Jip.

354
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,670
 Someday Your Highness will become a strong king 

355
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,920
 and you must sit atop that throne. 

356
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,040
Congratulations, Your Highness.

357
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,150
Your dragon robes look excellent on you.

358
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,740
If you have something to say, say it quickly.

359
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,320
You had asked whether if the people wanted it, I would be able to refuse.

360
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,760
Have you come to give an answer to that question?

361
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,230
I, your lowly servant, cannot refuse.

362
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,570
The hands that the people extend, the courage to reject that gesture,

363
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,890
is not something I have.

364
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,140
However, there is one realization I had.

365
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,980
When it comes to looking after the people,

366
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,760
the position of a throne is not needed.

367
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,250
What did you say?

368
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,390
In my position,

369
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,080
I will do my best to take care of the people.

370
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,160
Is that all

371
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,790
that you want?

372
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,890
It is my great and lofty wish.

373
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,760
Your wish...

374
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,640
 Have faith in me. Not for me,  

375
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,750
 but for you. That is my wish 

376
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,230
I will grant it.

377
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,960
I'll put my faith in you.

378
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,530
 You have found a way to truly benefit the people. 

379
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,330
 Then as for me, what kind of path should I walk? 

380
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:38,650
 Mother, I will surely protect my younger brother. 

381
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,320
  Yi Yi Myeong, First Minister of Central Council 

382
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,530
Let's keep it a secret from the Prime Minister.

383
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:01,990
As for His Highness the Crown Prince, he must also certainly never know. ( Yi Geon Myeong, Left Prime Minister) 

384
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,320
Only we must know of this. 
  (Jo Tae Chae, Second Minister of Central Council) 

385
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,110
A regency!

386
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,050
Do you truly not view me as King?

387
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,310
How much more must I yield?

388
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,260
I asked, just how much more do I have to yield!?

389
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,630
Your Majesty, how can you call this "yielding"?

390
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,020
Because the Great King Myeongjong passed without naming an heir,

391
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,410
have you forgotten how waves big and small shook the court?

392
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,590
What did you say?

393
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,260
I urge you. Please demonstrate your decisiveness befitting a great king.

394
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,230
Please take a decisive measure, Your Majesty.

395
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,240
Take your leave, all of you.

396
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,610
Your Majesty!

397
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,340
Didn't you hear me tell you all to go!

398
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,930
What did you three conspire to do?

399
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:31,090
For His Highness, we only fulfilled our duty as loyal subjects.

400
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,310
Do you truly not know who lies behind the Current Crown?

401
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,150
That fellow Yi In Jwa's poisonous reach

402
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,950
will ultimately maim Prince Yeoning. How can you not be aware of that!

403
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,280
Not even a court position.  Just the likes of a lowly teacher.

404
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,780
My, my.

405
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,680
Installation of Royal Successor followed by Regency.

406
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,900
Why don't you just ask me to hand you the royal  throne instead?

407
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,100
Your Majesty, I did not participate in either the request to be installed as royal successor or the request for regency.

408
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:24,060
However, I do not judge the will of the Norons to be wrong.

409
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,120
What? You dare to hold me in contempt.

410
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,860
I am just speaking of Your Majesty's reality of lacking a successor.

411
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,880
What is your truth?

412
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,760
Do you truly want the royal throne?

413
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,720
Do you covet this position, I ask!

414
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,560
Your Majesty.

415
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,260
Prince Yeoning won't even dream of it,

416
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,400
that his life is what's at stake.

417
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,420
My Liege, what about Baek Dae Gil?

418
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:21,360
Don't worry about it. In slaying a group, if you don't focus on one at a time,

419
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,920
you will be stabbed in the back.

420
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,860
Stab the White-Faced Scholar in the back? What do you mean?

421
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,560
Well, I'm that expert in back-stabbing, am I not?

422
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,440
You live so simply.

423
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,340
Where do you think you are to be waving your skirt around here.

424
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,360
I summoned her.

425
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,620
Traitor Jeong and Yi In Jwa's blood pledge.

426
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,440
This blood pledge is the end of Yi In Jwa.

427
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,800
So I agonized over it.

428
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,900
 Kill me?  Why? Because of the blood pledge? 

429
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,400
 But you already know Yi In Jwa would do that and then some. 

430
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,080
 Then what do you want? 

431
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,260
 The blood pledge. 

432
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,480
 So you are the same bastard. 

433
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,000
 Different. 

434
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:31,020
 I will never kill my person even if the blade is at my neck. ,

435
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,740
I have no desire to live kindly, unlike someone else.

436
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,400
But I have even less desire to croak in the gutter.

437
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,960
Good luck.

438
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,800
Then again, this is the joy people live for.

439
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,420
Even if you all are crowded together eating, butt to butt, it's what's nice.

440
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,080
Yi In Jwa.

441
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,740
If you wish to catch Yi In Jwa with this blood pledge, it's best you hurry.

442
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,750
The atmosphere in the royal palace is amiss.

443
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,460
There's been an uprising by Noron ministers with a request for Prince Yeoning to become regent.

444
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,340
His Majesty personally summoned Prince Yeoning to rebuke him.

445
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:32,000
That's strange. It hasn't been that long since he was installed as the crown prince, but regent too?

446
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,940
Is this Yi In Jwa's conjuring?

447
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:45,780
I can't confirm it isn't. If the matter bulges out, it will bring trouble to His Highness for sure.

448
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,060
First thing tomorrow, go see His Majesty and reveal the truth.

449
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,500
 Conspirators' lair: Korean folk village 

450
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,800
What are you all gathered for at this hour?

451
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,360
Tomorrow, we will try to draw the sword.

452
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,500
By sword?

453
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:12,880
Strike the entire lot of Noron ministers.

454
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,780
Let's hear it.

455
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,540
What is it?  Have you some great method?

456
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,660
Come on in.

457
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,640
Who is this?

458
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,440
I'm Mok Ho Ryong.

459
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,500
A Noron.

460
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,520
The Norons will be struck by a Noron sword.

461
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,980
Give me the details. What are you thinking?

462
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,560
Have you heard of the Three Pressing Hands?

463
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,300
Three ways to kill the king.

464
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:11,420
I will report to His Majesty tomorrow...

465
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:17,940
That the Norons have a plot to kill the king.

466
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:30,580
You ministers just need to help Mok Ho Ryong from behind.

467
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,960
Are you out?  Bring me water.

468
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,540
Who is that?

469
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,320
Is no one outside?

470
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,520
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

471
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,780
Senior Court Lady. Senior Court Lady!

472
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,400
Your Majesty, please kill us.

473
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,940
The tasting court lady has collapsed and today's general cabinet meeting has been cancelled.

474
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,300
What?

475
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,260
You're late.

476
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,000
Master.

477
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,340
Someone seems to have poisoned His Majesty's food.

478
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,960
Poison?

479
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,600
It's Yi In Jwa's doing.  I'm sure of it. I must see His Majesty at once.

480
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:57,820
Your Majesty.  It's mountain herbs.

481
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,860
Its not poisonous like monkshood or the arsenic plant.

482
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:08,000
But if you eat it wrong, it causes seizure and...

483
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,360
You can't see His Majesty at this time.

484
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,780
It's an important matter that requires a meeting now.  Please let him know it's Baek Dae Gil.

485
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,180
Come back in the afternoon.

486
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,180
Don't seek His Majesty's audience?

487
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,940
For now, it's best you don't make an appearance at the Convening Hall either.

488
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,500
Tell me the exact reason.

489
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,920
With the tasting court lady collapsed, there could be some misunderstanding.

490
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,580
Your Highness, please steer clear of politics for the time being and remain in your manor.

491
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,840
This is all for you, Crown Prince.

492
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,950
For those who act in my personal interest,

493
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,880
how could you have acted so foolishly?

494
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:13,890
Since it has already happened, resolving the issue comes first.

495
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,280
You must not meet with His Highness.

496
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,190
The issue has already become a bigger problem.

497
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:28,680
How could you know of the situation, special cavalry officer, to come here?

498
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,850
Yi In Jwa is scheming.

499
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,440
It is as expected. Now that he has power,

500
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,280
he will be desperately clamoring for more.

501
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,590
It's a dangerous situation. If something goes wrong, then even for His Highness the Crown Princeâ€”

502
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:47,090
Has it occurred to you that your interference would make things even more difficult for him?

503
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,770
We must stop him as best as we can.

504
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,380
I will protect His Highness, the Crown Prince.

505
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,880
It means that the Noron faction will protect him to the end.

506
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,170
Are you inside?

507
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,780
You came just in time.

508
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,120
Last night, His Majesty was not able to go to bed.

509
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,560
This morning the tasting court lady also fainted due to vomiting.

510
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,490
As you mentioned, using a sword is the highest priority method

511
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:28,350
and using a poison is the middle priority.

512
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:32,390
Then what is the last method left?

513
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,250
It's an ill rumor.

514
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,340
Ill rumor?

515
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:41,210
Don't you know there is an ill rumor floating around in the palace?

516
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:44,660
I mean the late King's will.

517
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,460
The late King's will?

518
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,530
To dethrone the Crown Prince and make him Prince Dogyang,

519
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,670
and to make Prince Yeoning succeed to the throne.

520
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,640
I heard that's how the King  left the will.

521
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,320
Already there is probably no one who lives in the palace who does not know.

522
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:14,550
His Majesty is no exception.

523
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,710
Now that the preparations are over,

524
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,490
which of you will take the lead?

525
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,820
I will have an audience with His Majesty.

526
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,580
Follow me.

527
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:56,460
First a sword, then poison. Now an ill rumor is being used to kick me out.

528
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,390
Is it a truth without the slightest trace of a lie?

529
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:03,430
How can I dare report a falsehood in front of this audience.

530
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,820
It is a sure truth. With my own two eyes and ears

531
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,430
I have seen and heard clearly.

532
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,160
Kim Chang Jip.

533
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,270
Yi Yi Myeong, Yi Geon Myeong, Jo Tae Chae,

534
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:21,250
as well as a hundred other core ministers of Noron, conspired together to commit treason?

535
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,480
Prince Yeoning is also no exception.

536
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,670
Your Majesty,

537
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,270
show us your decisive measure.

538
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,550
With a ruler's authoritative mighty blade,

539
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,850
behead the traitors!

540
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,630
This instant

541
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:44,410
arrest all the Noron ministers who were involved in the act of treason,

542
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,290
without leaving a single one out. Right now!

543
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:49,440
Your Majesty,

544
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,020
what should be done with His Highness Prince Yeoning?

545
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,810
Prince Yeoning.

546
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,510
It'll be better for you not to go.

547
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,880
What are you playing at?

548
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,160
It's not play, it's the King's command.

549
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,150
Why aren't you arresting the special cavalry officer?

550
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,890
Yes, Sir.

551
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,260
Do you dare draw your sword

552
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,010
in the palace?

553
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,150
Obediently allow yourself to be tied up.

554
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,840
Then nothing will happen to you.

555
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,880
-  Arrest them!  
 - What are you doing?

556
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,400
Let go of me. What do you think you're doing, bastards! Let go!

557
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,540
Let go! What are you doing, you bastards?

558
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,100
 Move aside. 

559
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,860
The situation is of the most pressing urgency, so you must immediately seek an audience with His Majesty.

560
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,610
Kim Che Geon,

561
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,930
you dare to oppose the King's command?

562
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,510
Whether it be the King's command or your trick,

563
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,150
we'll wait and see.

564
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:47,900
This time it won't be so easily resolved.

565
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,450
Your Majesty!

566
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,920
Tell me.

567
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,810
Have you truly drawn your sword in treason?

568
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,220
Speak!

569
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,270
Have you drawn your sword in treason, I ask you!

570
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,050
Your Majesty!

571
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,810
What are you talking about?

572
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,980
Rather,

573
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:24,380
why don't you say that you had your eyes on the throne?

574
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,750
Tell me to give you the throne.

575
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,700
If you do, then at least my heart will be at ease,

576
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,710
for killing you,

577
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,110
your older brother's heart.

578
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,530
Your Majesty!

579
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:56,690
Please spare the life of His Highness the Crown Prince.

580
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,800
Step aside,

581
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,950
because I am going to strike the neck of that traitor.

582
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,600
Your Majesty. If you are going to slay His Highness the Crown Prince,

583
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,950
strike me first!

584
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:27,980
You will give your life? Why?

585
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,220
Did you also partake in this treasonous act?

586
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:36,920
Baek Dae Gil, what on earth is your intention?

587
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,550
You cast away Yi In Jwa and cast me away.

588
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,840
After all that, you try to put that bastard up as King?

589
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,140
That's an absolutely unreasonable remark.

590
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,500
If not, since you are the royal bloodline of the Three Jongs,

591
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,000
do you think I'd spare the lives of you two brothers?

592
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,200
Did you think I didn't know?

593
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:07,030
Today,

594
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:11,800
I'll break off these tiresome and disgusting ties.

595
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,850
Move aside!
