1
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,270
 Episode 7 

2
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,990
Thankfully, the Crown Prince has accepted the regency,

3
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,380
and it went as we planned.

4
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,190
But it is still hard to read his (the King's) thoughts.

5
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,520
If we don't know the King's thoughts, we can just change them.

6
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,030
Changing the King's mind?

7
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,630
Even so, if we can't change the King's mind,

8
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,300
what will you do then?

9
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,500
If that's the case, then we must change the owner of that mind.

10
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,860
Heaven's will is determined by the people.

11
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,400
Are you going to change the king?

12
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,610
Your Highness, do you know the precepts of Mencius?

13
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,770
- What did you say? 
 - The monarchs are the boat, and the people are the water.

14
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,210
It is ultimately the water's decision to either flip or sink the boat,

15
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,020
so it's okay for iniquitous (bad) monarchs to be killed.

16
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,390
We were merely discussing the precepts of Mencius.

17
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,720
I definitely heard you say—

18
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,670
Was it a coincidence that you were involved

19
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,930
in the personal discussions of the Ministers or ...

20
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,850
have you been spying on us?

21
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,400
Since I think Your Highness has misunderstood, why don't you join us?

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,330
Do it in moderation.  Your acts seem risky in my eyes.

23
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,270
Your Highness, are you really just going to leave them alone like this?

24
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,510
It's not the right time yet.

25
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,290
I need to find strong evidence that can lock those people up.

26
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,010
Evidence.

27
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,560
Do you really not know how bold and shameless that Lee In Jwa is?

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,390
Have I not told you all this time  to not associate yourself with that man?

29
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,770
Did what I said mean nothing to you?

30
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,150
Royal Mother.

31
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,520
That man is planning to hide behind the Crown Prince and control the King and the court.

32
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,230
And he even kills people for his own personal interests.

33
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,330
He killed people?

34
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,680
I don't have any evidence, nor do I know why he did so,

35
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,900
but it seems he has killed a gambler named Baek Man Geum.

36
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,720
If it's the gambler,

37
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,190
Baek Man Geum...

38
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,830
Do you know him?

39
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,280
No.

40
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,480
How would I know him?

41
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,580
Please be careful.

42
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,300
Catching Lee In Jwa will not be easy.

43
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Besides the chief officer at the Left Branch Police Bureau, there are 12 police officers

44
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,660
and 20 prosecutors under the chief prosecutor at the Bureau of Prosecution.

45
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,500
And also a total of 10 inspectors including the chief at the Bureau of Inspection.

46
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,420
Keep this in mind.

47
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,830
It is the duty of the Office of Inspection to catch any traitors.

48
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,600
Tonight, Lee In Jwa definitely has to be captured. Do you understand?

49
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,890
Yes, Your Highness!

50
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,750
The proof has been shown, and you bet your hand, right?

51
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,320
Owner, what are you doing? Hurry up and cut this man's hand off.

52
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,820
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?!

53
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,450
Aigoo... What should I do now?

54
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,540
What's so difficult about cutting someone's hand off?

55
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,060
Hey noble, I am Demon, an actual demon.

56
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,000
Remember that well.

57
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,750
Baek Dae Gil...

58
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,800
What are you doing? CUT IT OFF!

59
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,530
Cut it off! Cut it off!

60
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,270
What the...?

61
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,670
This wench. What do you want?

62
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,550
Hold on a moment.

63
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,230
You were just a kid who didn’t know the difference between water and fire.

64
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,620
I am surprised at how fast you’ve grown up.

65
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,230
But I am also quite disappointed.

66
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,800
Even till this day, I've never used any underhanded methods.

67
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,900
So I dislike anyone who uses any underhanded methods or swindles.

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,600
So I cannot forgive whomever ruins a game through tricks.

69
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,110
But that tag came from your sleeve!

70
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,760
 When you grabbed my collar, 

71
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,040
 you probably secretly slipped it into my sleeve then. 

72
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,700
But it's also my fault for not noticing your gimmicks.

73
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,560
So I will forgive you this time.

74
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,340
They say the person who farts is the one who blames.

75
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,380
And now a person who swindled is the one who forgives?

76
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,110
It seems you still don't understand.

77
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,870
Then, I will prove it to you.

78
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,660
Owner Hong.

79
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,930
Blindfold me.

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,500
 What is he trying to do? 

81
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,560
The 10-point tag. If you're that confident, draw that one.

82
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,100
 10 

83
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,570
What? What the heck?

84
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,780
He really drew the 10-point tag.

85
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,550
Do it again.

86
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,630
The 1-point tag.

87
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,290
So you want the 1-point tag...

88
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,510
What do you think this tag is?

89
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,050
Stop speaking nonsense, and hurry up and reveal that tag!

90
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,350
 1 

91
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,500
What? Seriously?

92
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,050
Is he a ghost or something?

93
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Is this proof enough?

94
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,710
 What? How the heck did he do that? 

95
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,950
How did you do that?!

96
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,830
If you're curious, you figure it out yourself.

97
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,910
You came quite close this time.

98
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,230
 You came close to the truth you desired, by luckily being able to choose the nine. 

99
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,720
 What are you doing? CUT IT OFF! 

100
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,280
 And even using methods which aren't like you, 

101
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,670
 you cornered me into a difficult predicament. 

102
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:06,650
But if your final blow had been stronger, you could have caught me.

103
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,700
But it seems your luck and skill could only bring you this far.

104
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,140
In the end, you won't be able to find out the reason behind your father's death.

105
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Lee In Jwa.  It's not over yet.

106
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,800
Did you forget?  We have an agreement.

107
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:42,130
 With a messed up body like this, if I fall down from that cliff I will die for sure. 

108
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,000
 If I survive, I'll take it that you'll grant my wish. 

109
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,920
The promise that I will go ask for forgiveness at Baek Man Geum's tomb.

110
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,810
What will you do if I don't do it?

111
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,600
You've been acting almighty and awesome by yourself,

112
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,960
but in the end you're also just a cunning person?

113
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,290
Are you hypocritical chaff junk?!

114
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,580
Still, I wanted to save you.

115
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,960
What nonsense is that?

116
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,350
If I really intended to kill you, I would not have stabbed you here but here.

117
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,050
Or I would have slit your throat.

118
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:43,940
You survived not because you were lucky, but because I let you live, you punk.

119
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:52,140
No matter how much you show your claws, a tiger's cub is just a cub and not a tiger.

120
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:58,700
Just a tiger cub who can't even cope with the teeth of a hungry jackal.

121
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,930
Stop right there!

122
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,520
Darn it. Who is that now?

123
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,230
I'm sorry for spoiling the party,

124
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,730
but you guys would refuse someone dying but won't refuse someone joining the game.

125
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,750
Lee In Jwa.

126
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,300
Isn't this something you've seen many times?

127
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,850
What are you doing? Arrest these men this instant!

128
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,470
Yes!

129
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,950
- Let's go.
- Protect him!

130
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,160
Sister! Sister, this way. Move aside!

131
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240
Go out!

132
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,430
Arrest everyone without missing anyone!

133
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,830
I said go out!

134
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,170
 Father, did I lose? 

135
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,040
 Did I lose again? 

136
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,810
Lee In Jwa!

137
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,300
Let go!

138
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,880
Let that guy go.

139
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,130
What about you?

140
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,230
Don't worry.

141
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,920
Let's leave for now. Hurry!

142
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,320
Let them be.

143
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,470
Take that away.

144
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,120
It will only take a while.

145
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,220
Don't act like you worry about me.

146
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:26,860
For calling the man who killed my father your teacher, Dam Seo, you're just the same beast.

147
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:33,740
That's right. I must be that kind of person to you.

148
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,060
I'm sorry.

149
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,530
I take it back. I take back saying that I'd take you for my wife.

150
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,130
 I've marked this lady to be my wife from today on. 

151
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:58,240
 Anyway, you're this Gae Ttong's wife, so don't have any other thoughts. 

152
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,010
Even if I should die, even if you come after me with a sword, I will do it.

153
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,090
Whether it's 100 or 1000 tries, I'm going to stand up against Lee In Jwa again.

154
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,580
So don't think about stopping me.

155
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,880
At least say something.

156
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,340
Your Highness, no matter how much evidence you have,

157
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,350
things won't work out as you wish.

158
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:10,850
Illegal gambling, taking lands, cornering and hoarding salt, ginseng and water buffalo horns  (used for bows). 

159
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,590
Even with the list I just mentioned, you will face a death sentence. Why?

160
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:27,380
Will you feel relief after I investigate the death of Baek Dae Gil's father as well?

161
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,520
You probably should slay me with a sword right now.

162
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,370
Right now is the only chance for you to kill me.

163
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,790
Fine, wait here for a moment.

164
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,130
I will punish your disgusting mouth with the righteous laws.

165
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:08,590
 You survived not because you were lucky, but because I let you live, you punk. 

166
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,350
 No matter how much claw you show, a cub is just a cub, not a tiger. 

167
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,970
 You are just a mere cub that cannot even cope with the teeth of a hungry jackal. 

168
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Dear God who controls Joseon from the south to the north,

169
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,480
if our Dae Gil has died, please let him accept this food.

170
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,270
And if he is alive, please take good care of him.

171
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,110
Take care of me, my ass. I just came back from death.

172
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,000
This old man is now hearing things.

173
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,210
No way, who are you?

174
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,920
It's you, Dae Gil!

175
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,620
Dae Gil, Dae Gil!

176
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,660
You came back alive. Let me take a look.

177
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,240
Let me look.

178
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,070
Let's see if you've lost any teeth.

179
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,720
Aigo, my face is going to wear out, stop touching it.

180
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,910
Is getting worn out the problem? Let me take a look.

181
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,360
Come here.

182
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,910
Here, eat quickly. It was made for your memorial food anyway.

183
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,740
Since you have come back, everything is yours. Enjoy it.

184
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:08,120
Grandpa... Dad's enemy... I wanted to get revenge.

185
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,790
I really wanted to get revenge, but...

186
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:20,600
It's okay, you've done enough. Your father won't want much more either.

187
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,100
No... It is not because of Father, but now I cannot endure it myself.

188
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,980
I... I want to overcome that guy.

189
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:48,450
I'm really gonna die!

190
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,160
Stop!

191
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,470
Your Highness, what brings you here?

192
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,560
I came to see if the investigation was going well.

193
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,370
How come there are only these people?  Where is Lee In Jwa?

194
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,750
Who?

195
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,830
These guys' leader, Lee In Jwa.

196
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,820
That man must be in the Royal Investigation Bureau.

197
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,610
The  Royal Investigation Bureau?  Why is only that man in the  Royal Investigation Bureau?

198
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,850
I'm not sure. Well, for that,

199
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,880
don't you think the prosecutors would know?

200
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,700
Sir!

201
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,000
Let all of these guys go!

202
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,720
Yes!

203
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,000
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

204
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,460
The prosecutors have forgiven their crimes.

205
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,820
So we no longer have any power over this situation.

206
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,350
He's not here either?

207
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,120
It is true that he was sent here, the Royal Investigation Bureau, to investigate the truth of the ledger book.

208
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:51,260
But as soon as the ledger book was confirmed, the Inspector General took him personally.

209
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,060
What do you mean the Inspector General? You mean from the Bureau of Inspection?

210
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:03,830
Your Highness, you belong to the Bureau of Inspection but you did not know that?

211
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,470
 Why did the Inspector General do that? Why on earth? 

212
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,800
The ledger book. Where is the ledger book?

213
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,890
As you can see, all these are fabricated ledger books.

214
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,420
 Revenue and Expenditure Account Book 

215
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,540
There is not one single true record.

216
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,210
The ledger books and information in them are all fake,

217
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,750
and the people that were listed as receiving bribes

218
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,220
from Lee In Jwa, all their names and positions were all fake.

219
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,550
This just means that this is fake.

220
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:31,720
Lord, how could you share drinks with a criminal?

221
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,480
Criminal?

222
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,070
Your Highness, who are you saying is  a criminal?

223
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,840
Lord!

224
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,680
You should sit as well, there seems to have been some misunderstandings.

225
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,260
Right Branch Police Chief!

226
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,140
Your Highness, I heard that you made a big mistake today.

227
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,090
A mistake?

228
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,230
Are you saying arresting that man was a mistake?

229
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,410
Isn't that right?

230
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,980
First of all, you arrested an innocent man without any evidence.

231
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,580
Second, you neglected your duty at the Bureau of Inspection, where you are supposed to keep your eyes on the corruption of the officials,

232
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,390
and seized a gambling place that has nothing to do with your duty.

233
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,470
Third, you exceeded your authority by giving the police and the prosecutors orders for personal matters.

234
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,310
I am not sure how big, but there'll be quite a commotion in the royal court due to this matter tomorrow.

235
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,320
Right Branch Police Chief! What did you just say?

236
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,480
Your Highness, perhaps you took action after receiving  approval from the crown prince?

237
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:46,960
Huh, you arrested the crown prince's teacher without evidence, but you didn't even say a word to him?

238
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Hmm... that is...

239
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,360
He seems to have a lot he wants to say to me,

240
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,970
so will the two of you step outside for a moment?

241
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,180
Let's do that.

242
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:27,970
How much did you really give to those guys?

243
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,340
First of all, calm your anger and take one glass.

244
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:44,730
Your evil influence, how far has it spread? Where's the root of it!?

245
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,630
Where the heck is it?

246
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:52,440
Do you really think that I am the root of the evil influences?

247
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,760
He's acting up fearlessly when he is just the son of a mere water maid.

248
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:06,200
He doesn't know how things work. It just shows that he couldn't shake his lowly origin, just like an ox that is set free.

249
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,080
That is why I kept his leash tightly tied to the Bureau of Inspection.

250
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,000
Keep this in your mind, Your Highness. No matter how smart you are,

251
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,840
the truth is that you cannot do politics alone.

252
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,460
On top of that, your origin is...

253
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Stop there!

254
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,100
You were talking about the righteous national law, but end up wielding a sword?

255
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,820
That is also not much different from the king.

256
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,670
What did you say?

257
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,590
Well then, try slaying me.

258
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,100
I will stay right here.

259
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,330
I can see it in my eyes.

260
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,300
You'll slay me, slay the Sorons (New Learning faction), slay the crown prince.

261
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,200
In  the end, isn't it that you want to sit on the throne?

262
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,250
Shut up!

263
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:38,120
I will take my leave now, Your Highness Prince Yeoning.

264
00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:00,270
What did you say? Kick out Lee In Jwa?

265
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,450
When it's not even enough even if you ask for forgiveness, but you are asking an absurd...

266
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,060
Your Highness, how much do you really know?

267
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,250
What are you talking about?

268
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,930
What kind of man he is, what kind of ambition he has, and what his goals are

269
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:26,090
and how far he has spread his roots in this royal court.

270
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,450
Do you know about it?

271
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,970
That man Lee In Jwa is—
- That man Lee In Jwa is my friend.

272
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,360
What more do I have to know?

273
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,530
 I will definitely protect you, My Prince. 

274
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,570
 You are? 

275
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,880
 Yes, My Prince. 

276
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:57,490
 However, if I save you from the pit, what will you give me? 

277
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,440
 I will give you everything. 

278
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,470
 If you save me, I will give you everything I have. 

279
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:11,620
 Even... Even... Even if that is the throne, I'll give it to you. 

280
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,920
 You have to sit on the throne. 

281
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,290
 I'll just take your considerations. 

282
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:31,900
That man Lee In Jwa is my right hand, left hand and a man who has hold of my heart.

283
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,070
I will not regard your mistake today as an issue.

284
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,920
Hence, no matter what Lee In Jwa does,

285
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,940
feign ignorance and let it pass.

286
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,800
That is for my sake.

287
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,090
and for the sake of the royal court

288
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,940
and for the sake of this nation, Joseon.

289
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,770
I mean it is not your concern, Prince Yeoning.

290
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,900
 Is there nothing 

291
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,830
 that I can do? 

292
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,410
 Despite being a prince of the nation, 

293
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,450
 indeed there is not a thing 

294
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,330
 I can do of my own accord? 

295
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,040
 Indeed? 

296
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,900
 King Sookjong 
Are you crying?

297
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,890
So you are finally growing some sense.

298
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,830
Are you unharmed?

299
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,320
What became of it?

300
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,700
Baek Dae Gil, right after the ruckus, returned home.

301
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,560
That bastard Ban Poon, we need to get him.

302
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,750
Demon and the minions from the salt field as well.

303
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,430
They returned to Ganghwa Island upon release from the police bureau.

304
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,620
The gambling den as well.  Tomorrow they will open as a normal business.

305
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,060
I feel fatigue.  You should go and rest as well.

306
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,610
Yes, Teacher.

307
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,490
Moo Myeong.

308
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,200
Keep watch over Baek Dae Gil.

309
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,270
Whom he meets where, and what he does.

310
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,270
Every little detail.

311
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,280
What became of that child?

312
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,480
I wonder.

313
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,020
By that child, do you mean, Yeong Soo?

314
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,890
Prince Yeoning said Baek Man Geum, the father who raised that child,

315
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,960
died at the hands of Lee In Jwa.

316
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,850
If that is the truth...

317
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,330
My Lord.

318
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Sit.

319
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,320
Tell me what happened to Prince Yeoning today.

320
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,600
I'll keep this a secret.

321
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,200
And you must do so as well.

322
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,820
He ran a sweep at the gambling den and successfully captured Lee In Jwa.

323
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,470
But the Police Bureau, the Royal Investigation Bureau and Office of the Inspector General  colluded as one.

324
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,630
And in the end, he was released.

325
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:24,950
Hence he is in His Majesty's audience, crying?

326
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:29,980
The unfairness and the infuriation?

327
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:41,120
According to Prince Yeoning, the gambler named Baek Man Geum

328
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,220
was killed at the hands of Lee In Jwa.

329
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,840
Do you know the story behind it?

330
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,600
Though Baek Man Geum's corpse hasn't been discovered,

331
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,620
a man who is his child kept going against Lee In Jwa in the name of revenge.

332
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,270
His child, did you say?

333
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,810
Yes, a man named Baek Dae Gil.

334
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,070
However, why do you...

335
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,820
Baek Dae Gil.

336
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,780
You were alive, child.

337
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,660
He got it right at one go?

338
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,780
How did he do it?

339
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,500
You think you know something but you don't.

340
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,630
A visible sign is something that novices use.

341
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,700
Then...

342
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,480
Can't be...  The weight is different?

343
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,030
Weight?

344
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,990
See.

345
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,670
Look. These gambling tags.

346
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,940
They are made with dozens of thin paper sheets.

347
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,910
They are hardened with a brush of oil.

348
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:27,860
Now, depending on how many more or less thin sheets were used,

349
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,900
the weight could change.

350
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,980
But it would still be only a difference of one sheet of paper. How can he know that tiny difference?

351
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,770
That's not an act a human can commit.

352
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,950
White-Faced Scholar, Lee In Jwa.

353
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,740
You should know too since you saw him.

354
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,570
His gaze isn't that of a human.

355
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,790
 Never in my life even until now have I ever used a trick. 

356
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,660
Lee In Jwa?

357
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:19,240
Grandpa, how do you know the name of the White-Faced Scholar?

358
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,010
Lee In Jwa? I don't know him.

359
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,680
You better speak now.

360
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,820
Alright, I got it.

361
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,850
There are ill fates in my life.

362
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,600
The first ill fate is the one that snatched away my eye.

363
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,700
The second ill fate is the White-Faced Scholar. Lee In Jwa.

364
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
 In the eight provinces of Joseon, 

365
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,510
 he is a gambling master among gambling masters, ranking in the top five. 

366
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,570
 At the time I was known as Namsan Goblin 

367
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,960
 with quite some fame as well. 

368
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,070
 But somehow before him, I could never garner any power. 

369
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,560
 So why did he kill my father? 

370
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,290
 What was the reason? 

371
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,800
 I don't know the details of that either. 

372
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,690
 However, one thing is for certain. 

373
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,160
 It's that on that day, he said something strange to Man Geum. 

374
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,920
 Bear that in mind. Once that child is fully grown, 

375
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,880
 I will take your life away. 

376
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,840
But why haven't you told me all this time?

377
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,610
Because I was worried about you.

378
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:16,200
In order to save you, I've kept my mouth tightly shut about it.

379
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,800
Grandpa, listen clearly to what I'm about to tell you.

380
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,810
 I am going to get stronger. 

381
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,700
 White-Faced Scholar.  I will become twice as strong as him and return. 

382
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:04,630
 Alright.  You are a rascal who even defied death.  

383
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,790
 You will do well. 

384
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:11,500
Don't skip any meals, Kid!

385
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,230
 Dae (big) Bak (ship) =  Jackpot 

386
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,840
Jackpot!

387
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,970
The rascal is going on his path!

388
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:55,420
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

389
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:19,620
 No matter how you show your claws, a tiger cub is still a tiger cub and not a tiger.  

390
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:26,590
 Just a tiger cub who can't even cope with the teeth of a hungry jackal. 

391
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,970
So did you find out?

392
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:45,900
He is Hwang Jin Gi, who once served as military officer of the Bureau of Declaration. In martial skills, he is tops by far.

393
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,500
As you know, he was deemed a traitor, and is currently locked up in  the  Royal Investigation Bureau.

394
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,610
Indeed, he would be a perfect choice as your underling.

395
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,530
Furthermore, this man

396
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,010
also shares an ill fate with the king's sword.

397
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,970
What is it?

398
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,290
I, Baek Dae Gil, who was supposed to be Joseon's best gambling master,

399
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,390
shall serve you as my teacher starting today,.

400
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,300
Why would a guy who wanted to be a gambling master serve me as his teacher?

401
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,200
You've got the wrong guy. You should go back now.

402
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,180
Today, I will die.

403
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,930
Why should I care whether you die or not?

404
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,180
You should care.  Because I'm about to become your disciple.

405
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Why, you rascal! Listen to what you're saying—

406
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,500
Your only disciple is going to go die now.

407
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,790
It's up to you, Master, to let him die or live.

408
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,490
What a lame fellow.

409
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,870
Tonight is the last chance.  The last chance to leave this place.

410
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,120
Let's go.  How long will you live like this?

411
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:26,990
I'll block them so you guys run away together without looking back no  matter what.

412
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:31,400
You... why are you doing this?

413
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,910
You should go back to your hometown.

414
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,300
What are you guys doing?

415
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:06,560
Ban Poon, I'm grinding my teeth whenever I think about the lashings I got because of you.

416
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,090
You came on your own feet.

417
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,000
What are you waiting for? Get them.

418
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,350
Yes, Sir.

419
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:34,820
What are you doing?  You're not going to open the door?  How long will you live like this?

420
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,760
What are you waiting for, you idiots!  They're all getting away.

421
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,900
Get him!

422
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,300
After them!

423
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,440
Ban Poon, did you have a good sleep?

424
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,430
Dae Gil.

425
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,730
What?

426
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:38,960
It's not Ban Poon.  It's Dae Gil.  My name.

427
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,200
Alright, Bae Dae Gil.

428
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:51,000
But doing when ordered to do, scarfing down when given food,  barking when told to bark, biting when told to bite.

429
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:57,490
That's how they're supposed to live. Who are you to take over their lives?

430
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,440
Huh? Do you own this country?

431
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,810
What about you? Why do you treat people like animals? A mere thing like you.

432
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,830
That is the order of the world.

433
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:15,500
Ones who lack get stepped on. Ones who have more get to do the stepping.

434
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:22,260
You know that?  They're all going to croak because of you.

435
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:28,680
Because of you, those guys will all get captured and die.

436
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,540
Caught one so soon?

437
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,170
Seol Im.

438
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,960
What happened to you?  I'm sorry.

439
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,220
What?  This bastard Ban Poon haunts you so you couldn't run far?

440
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,770
Bring the sickle.

441
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,570
Stop.

442
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,740
What? Can't watch?

443
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,870
You...  you're going to die by my hand.

444
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,160
The bastard.

445
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:24,400
The nerve you have!  What do you have to rely on for you to be so full of yourself?

446
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:31,120
Alright, we'll find out soon whether you die or I do.

447
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,680
Watch it well.  This wench here,

448
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,810
she dies because of you. Got that?

449
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,550
Help me!

450
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,800
Help me, please. Help me, please.

451
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:57,600
This grace, I will, with the rest of my life, repay you a hundred, a thousand times.

452
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:02,860
So don't just watch and help me! Help me!

453
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,390
This bastard's really gone nuts.

454
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:14,400
Watch.  Seol Im, this is all self-inflicted.

455
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,410
Understand?

456
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:23,650
What the?

457
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,900
What the?

458
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,480
I'm a little busy.  Come all at once.

459
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,410
That bastard's eaten something wrong.

460
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,390
What are you waiting for, you goons?

461
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,540
You came to my house on purpose, right? So I'd come here.

462
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,710
Don't be so impertinent.

463
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,430
Get him.

464
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,320
Look.  These vermin.

465
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,990
They will not be eradicated just because you step up alone.

466
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,830
No, I'm not alone.

467
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,470
What the?  These bastards.

468
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,520
Go!

469
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,710
Even a worm will squirm if you step on it.

470
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:28,710
Even a mouse, when cornered, will bite the cat.

471
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,270
Much less the people.

472
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,100
Look! Do you know what this is?

473
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,280
The wench has gone crazy.  Put that down or else!

474
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,800
 Slave Contract 

475
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,100
- Kim Bok Ttol. 
 - Here!

476
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,270
Grandpa, go back to your home to see Grandma now.

477
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:19,260
Crazy...

478
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,600
- Kim Gan Nan. 
 - Yes.

479
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,100
- Park Se Hong. 
 - Here.

480
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,300
- Jang Chang Yong. 
  -That's me.

481
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,700
- Go Gap Soe. 
 - Right here.

482
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,500
- Lee Gil Beom. 
- That's me, me!

483
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,000
- Yoo Soon Jin. 
 - That's me, though.

484
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,160
 Gye Seol Im Slave Contract 

485
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:04,150
 Born on Year of Gap-oh, Month 2, Day 3 with healthy body. 

486
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:09,320
Seol Im. Gye Seol Im.

487
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,510
That...

488
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,080
Watch.

489
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,930
We are now free.  Free.

490
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,400
The wench wants to croak.

491
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,830
Hey.

492
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,540
You are all crazy.

493
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,190
Crazy.

494
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:46,040
Now we should go back to our home towns.

495
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,010
To our home towns.

496
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,500
Home town!

497
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,800
We're going back. We are.

498
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,390
♬    How many tears must I shed    ♬

499
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:10,210
♬   How much more must I ache     ♬

500
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:15,410
♬   Will I be able to forget you and erase you    ♬

501
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,780
♬    I will turn my back at time   ♬

502
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,990
♬    so I can't see you     ♬

503
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:30,350
♬    so my foolish heart can forget you   ♬

504
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:38,410
♬   My heart can'd forget you distant heart  ♬

505
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:49,830
♬   Like a fool approahcing my heart    ♬

506
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,630
♬   Even if I weep soundlessly   ♬

507
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:56,700
Let's meet again for sure.

508
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,690
For sure.

509
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:07,950
♬   I miss you, miss you, more so today than yesterday     ♬

510
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:12,870
♬   I miss you, oh my love     ♬

511
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:20,540
♬   I miss you, more so today    ♬

512
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,030
You said you wanted to be my disciple, right?

513
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,860
Follow me.

514
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,470
Kim Che Geon?

515
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,760
That king's sword you spoke of must be Kim Che Geon then.

516
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,090
It's getting interesting.

517
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,620
How's Prince Yeoning?

518
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,580
He's immersed in collecting information.

519
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,210
Every little thing related to you, Teacher.

520
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,580
Is this all the information on Lee In Jwa?

521
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:37,420
Yes, other than the census registry at Hanseongbu  (today's Seoul) , the information here is everything.

522
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,310
But why all this...

523
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,650
Because I need to know

524
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:46,200
what kind of a person the prey I plan to hunt really is.

525
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:52,090
Where he was born, who his father is, whether he has a wife and kids.

526
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,360
I must know everything about him.

527
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:01,040
Only thus can I catch him.

528
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,880
Lose the fat first.  Here, here, and here.

529
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:22,940
Losing is losing but shouldn't I get a bite first?

530
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,360
Shouldn't I?

531
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:32,810
From now on, say "master" and with respect. Got that?

532
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,830
Yeah.

533
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,490
Still?

534
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:56,040
You guys messed with the wrong man.

535
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,530
Aigoo. I should've just looked on other people's trouble indifferently as if it's fire on a far-away mountain.

536
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:04,120
I'm Demon.

537
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,550
Demon that eats people.

538
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,400
What? Bastard.

539
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,180
Hurry and drop me down.

540
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,280
You said you're a demon that eats people.

541
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,410
Your friend is here, so you two have a good time.

542
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,070
What?

543
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,510
Wow, he's really mad I think.

544
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,010
Why?

545
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,890
Because of you the female died!

546
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:43,440
The one and only female within hundreds of miles died, so he must be so pissed. Don't you think?

547
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:49,230
Let me down, you bastards!

548
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,490
Let me down!

549
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:59,150
♬  Will I be able to see time stop then?  ♬

550
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:09,190
♬  Will your heart be with me then?  ♬

551
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:13,690
♬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  ♬

552
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,290
 Jackpot 

553
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,850
♬  I will withstand you. ♬  

554
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:20,390
 Forget capturing any beasts with that skill of yours, you'll lose your limbs first. 

555
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,490
 Lee In Jwa. 

556
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,530
 How about it?  We battle for life or death today. 

557
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:27,310
 Don't you see the people's bloody pus and bloody tears? 

558
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,600
 Forgive me. 

559
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,090
 Grant me permission, Teacher. 

560
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,520
 Are you ready?  

561
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,820
 You are Lee In Jwa? 

562
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,010
 You will have a lot to do soon. 

563
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,510
 I am aware of Your Ladyship Consort Sook Bin's past as well. 

564
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,330
 - You wench! 
- Help me get an audience with His Majesty. 

565
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,970
 The king you serve deserves death. 

566
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,010
 Why do you cast such a heavy mission upon your son? 

567
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,150
 What exactly is your identity, Master? You're a traitor? 

568
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,520
 I plan to kill the king.
