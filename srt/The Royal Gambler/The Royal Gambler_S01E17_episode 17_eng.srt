 Episode 17 

2
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,160
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

3
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,140
You bastard!

4
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,380
What are you doing?

5
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,320
Are you crazy?

6
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,610
This can't be...

7
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,420
Your father... Your father, Man Geum... Where is he?

8
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,550
 How can I believe what you're saying? 

9
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,400
 You can just dig up his grave and open the casket. 

10
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,750
 Inside it 

11
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,080
 is the truth. 

12
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,430
 Year of Gyesa (1713), Month 4, Day 12. 
Baek Man Geum taken in by Yi In Jwa for treatment of hemostasis. 

13
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,570
You're the last person who saw  Father that day!

14
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,990
Why are you suddenly looking for Orabeoni Man Geum? 
  (orabeoni =  modern oppa, older brother) 

15
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,340
Let's cut to the chase. What happened to my Father's corpse?

16
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,680
 Stop right there! Stop! 

17
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,460
 Stop! Catch him! 

18
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,980
 Get him out of the water. 

19
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,700
 Pulling Orabeoni's corpse up, 

20
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,110
 I took it to the White-Faced Scholar. 

21
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,150
 Yi In Jwa 

22
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,600
 Bury him in a place with lots of sunshine. 

23
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,300
 Yes, My Liege. 

24
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,300
 Well, I'll be going. 

25
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,700
Is that all?

26
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,480
What else could there be?

27
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,150
 Commoner's Medical Clinic  

28
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,260
At that time, we thought that Man Geum was really dead.

29
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,030
But he is alive...

30
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:21,030
I'm sure Yi In Jwa must have played some kind of trick.

31
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,600
 Wait. 

32
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,550
 Medical Treatment Records 

33
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,450
Oh.

34
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,520
I just remember it.

35
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,760
There was indeed a patient who was shot by an arrow.

36
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,030
There was, and...?

37
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,840
He miraculously survived.

38
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,000
Then... Man Geum... has been alive?

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,500
Does it make sense?

40
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,310
What happened to that patient after that?

41
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,700
I think it was probably on the third day...

42
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,330
 He was unconscious. 

43
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,400
 It appeared someone must have taken him. 

44
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,180
It's Yi In Jwa.

45
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,790
Are you sure the patient was alive?

46
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,850
No need to think.

47
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,580
I'm sure he was alive.

48
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,910
Ah, D-Dae..!

49
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,560
 I will not watch the plight of a water maid's child seated on the royal throne. 

50
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,400
 I cannot bear to see such low borns soil the royal court. 

51
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,870
 Your Highness. 

52
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,930
The King is looking for you.

53
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,090
Do you know why I didn't cut Yi In Jwa's neck off right away,

54
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,300
but gave him two days?

55
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,590
Is it because you want to lurk in order to draw the traitor Jeong in?

56
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,550
But now I've changed my mind.

57
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,600
He won't fall in.

58
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,590
Jeong will never fall into the king's trap.

59
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,980
It's very natural that someone who has experienced a calamity won't do it.

60
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,440
He's probably testing me.

61
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,820
Don't even mention that rotten White-Faced Scholar.

62
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,250
If you think about what I went through because of him...

63
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,220
 He must be thinking 

64
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,390
 of whether I'm a card that needs to be kept 

65
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,070
 or a card that can be discarded. 

66
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,310
But 
  (Hwang Jin Ki) 

67
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,730
why that person is not making a move?

68
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,800
Whether he considers me as a discard...

69
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,010
He is not convinced of him.

70
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,860
He is one who has at least a thousand monster serpents in him.

71
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,710
For a long period of time, evading me,

72
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,230
that's how he has sustained his life.

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,700
Then... What do you have to do now?

74
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,510
Instead of chasing two rabbits and missing both of them,

75
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,640
I'll catch the one in front of me first.

76
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,140
  Military Mobilization 

77
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,490
Is this the tag to authorize a military mobilization?

78
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,330
Military Training Command, Royal Brigade Command, Northern Garrison Command, Southern Garrison Command, Capital Garrison Command,

79
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,840
I'll pass the authority over all those departments to you.

80
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,140
Since the traitor's knife point came under your nose,

81
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,570
you must kill him.

82
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

83
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,760
Your Highness.

84
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,490
 Yi Geon Myeong, Yi Yi Myeong, Kim Chang Jip 

85
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,720
 Military Mobilization 

86
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,340
Is this the tag to authorize a military mobilization?

87
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,670
 No need to think. I'm sure he was alive. 

88
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,930
 Your answer is important. 

89
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,040
Who is this?

90
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,870
 The chartered merchants, the boss of the gambling den, and even the child named Dam Seo, 

91
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,780
 have abandoned Yi In Jwa. 

92
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,880
I asked who you are.

93
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,130
 But there is a case when one commander is more important than one hundred soldiers. 

94
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,380
 I want to hear your opinion. 

95
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,130
 Whether you join Yi In Jwa's side. 

96
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,610
Clansman Jeong will seek Baek Dae Gil's answer,

97
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,430
and he will mobilize, according to that answer, whether to save me or not.

98
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,910
But those Soron punks aren't even showing their noses.

99
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,130
Why those ministers...

100
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,710
No. They must be putting in their convulsive efforts,

101
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,830
since they are next if this Yi In Jwa dies.

102
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,830
Your Highness, Crown Prince. Shouldn't we calculate all the pros and cons?

103
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,350
I said I will meet my teacher; why are you opposing it? 
  (Crown Prince Yoon, later King Gyeongjong) 

104
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,330
Crown Prince, to meet the traitor Yi In Jwa, who's been arrested at this hour,

105
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,290
is a matter of grave danger.  Better to persuade His Majesty

106
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,670
and open a royal interrogation

107
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,850
to get an innocent verdict for Yi In Jwa.

108
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,810
If he is found to be a traitor and dies,

109
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,250
wouldn't it also bring about a great flaw upon the governing of Your Highness who have kept him close?

110
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,410
Why are the heads not matching up to the tails?

111
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,570
Clearly we said to abandon Yi In Jwa and raise a different sword.

112
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,630
Our Sorons' survival hangs upon it.

113
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,890
How can we just do as what you alone say!

114
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,570
How does this appear to you?

115
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,670
To me, it appears to be a military authorization to behold the traitors.

116
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:07,090
No, before that, this is a horse without feet.
 ("a horse without feet": a Korean metaphor for a rumor) 

117
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,290
Horse without feet?

118
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,890
As they say, rumors travel faster than a horse, right?

119
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:37,550
 Before they mobilize their treacherous minds, there is a need to corner them just a bit more. 

120
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:45,330
Until the mice that are cornered show their claws,

121
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,870
we are to wait?

122
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,910
 State Tribunal 

123
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,630
Please let me in.  It'll only be brief.

124
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:06,990
Not so. No one is allowed inside at this hour, much less a high traitor. Go back now.

125
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,190
Are you here to see Yi In Jwa?

126
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,970
Your father is alive?

127
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:32,150
 His real father, Baek Man Geum, is alive? 

128
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,130
Follow me.

129
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,090
Explain so I can understand.

130
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,430
I was with him. When you came to see me.

131
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,770
 When you came to me to ask why I killed Baek Man Geum, 

132
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,070
 Baek Man Geum was also present there. 

133
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,990
 Father was there? 

134
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,030
So then, where's Father?

135
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,530
Why has he not shown up once in all this time if he was alive?

136
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,290
Because Baek Man Geum also wished for you to become king.

137
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,950
At first, he couldn't comprehend.

138
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,630
 Are you awake? 

139
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,310
 Yi...  Yi In Jwa. 

140
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,530
 To see you lying here, I do feel somewhat... 

141
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,790
 Look here, Baek Man Geum. 

142
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,650
 How about making a deal with me as though you've died once? 

143
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,170
 I plan to make Baek Dae Gil the king. 

144
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,050
 But upon grasping the depth of the great cause, he also agreed 

145
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,270
 to my will. 

146
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,850
Stop babbling dog crap.

147
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,010
Father wouldn't have abandoned me to follow the likes of you. Father...

148
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,370
Baek Man Geum knew the whole truth.

149
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,010
That you are the child of the current king and Consort Sook. That you are a royal descendant carrying the blood of the Three Jongs (Hyojong, Hyeonjong, Sukjong).

150
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,130
So for the sake of this grand cause,

151
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,530
he relinquished your link as father and son.

152
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,850
It's your time now. Time for you to draw your sword.

153
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,870
Not for me, but for the sake of this nation Joseon, for the people.

154
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,650
So where's my father?

155
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:32,350
At the moment, Baek Man Geum is at a place where his life hangs on a word from me.

156
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,170
So what will you do?

157
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,050
If you touch a fingernail of my father's,

158
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:46,890
be prepared. Before you're taken to have your sentence enforced,  you will die by my hands first.

159
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,690
Then make your move.

160
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,750
You alone can save me.

161
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,850
 Mark my words. Only I, Yi In Jwa,  

162
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,950
 can find your father, Baek Man Geum.  

163
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,810
Will you do it?

164
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,210
I asked, do you intend to save Yi In Jwa?

165
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,430
It's Yi In Jwa's cajoling. If your father was alive,

166
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,970
why hasn't he appeared?

167
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,810
All you have is Yi In Jwa's word but no way to prove it.

168
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,290
Sang Gil.

169
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,010
Yes, Your Highness.

170
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,970
 Bliss Palace: Buddhist Temple 

171
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,790
What do you  mean? Baek Man Geum is alive?

172
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,590
You didn't know?

173
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:27,350
Can't be.  I saw his corpse with my own eyes.

174
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,590
No, Father is clearly alive.

175
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:41,170
 Father's tomb was empty and Yi In Jwa's glance was not that of a liar. 

176
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,710
Baek Man Geum who was thought dead is alive?

177
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,690
 Master, did you hide that even from me as well? 

178
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,790
 While on the account of Baek Man Geum's death, I have... 

179
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,250
Tell me where my father might be right now.

180
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,090
Can't be.  My teacher...

181
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,970
I can't lose my father again to that filthy ambition of Yi In Jwa's.

182
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,230
The capital is all in the teacher's grasp. You'll never find him like this.

183
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,530
No, I must find him even if I have to turn the capital upside down.

184
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:27,950
I can only tell you one thing.  Don't stand by my teacher no matter what.

185
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,690
You should also let it go now.

186
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,470
Toward my father,

187
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,100
your feeling of guilt and regret.

188
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,440
I'll let go of all those feelings from now on.

189
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,740
It's a relief.

190
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,940
It's a real relief.

191
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,800
That your father is alive.

192
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,730
What?

193
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,860
No way. What on earth did Yi In Jwa say to you?

194
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,050
He probably suggested a deal.

195
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,530
He probably said, if you save him, he'd tell you where your father is.

196
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,330
What are all of you doing up at this hour?

197
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,400
Hey, you punk, do you think we can sleep when you look grief-stricken?

198
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,560
Dae Gil. We are on your side.

199
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,240
No matter what  you decide, we'll follow your decision.

200
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,860
Salvation Tag?

201
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,120
 Kim Che Geon, since I will be entrusting and supporting you as the King's Swordsman, 

202
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,370
 use your great martial art skills for Joseon. 

203
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,260
 Also, the salvation tag that I bestow on you 

204
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,810
 will save your life one day. 

205
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,200
With this salvation tag that the King bestowed on me,

206
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,000
you are probably able to save Yi In Jwa's life.

207
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,800
 Salvation Tag 

208
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,270
The King bestowed a military authorization tag on you, didn't he?

209
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,430
Yes. Royal Mother. Are you worried about me?

210
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,160
We don't know how the cornered animal will react.

211
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Don't be worried about me, Royal Mother.

212
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,000
Nothing will happen.

213
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,700
Are you worried about Hyungnim?

214
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,220
We'll come to the greeting together, tomorrow.

215
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,300
Thank you, Prince Yeoning.

216
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,950
What happened?

217
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,870
She is staying in a small temple on Inwang Mountain.

218
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,380
Did you notice any hint of movement?

219
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,180
The Sorons are still discussing at the table.

220
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,810
The boss of  the gambling house on Six Ministries Street will be restrained until the execution is carried out.

221
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,090
Then everything is ready.

222
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,000
Now, is this the time to ride the horse without feet?

223
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,680
Your Highness the Crown Prince, are you there?

224
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,090
What happened at this late hour?

225
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,130
This Prince Yeoning came to earnestly request something of you.

226
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,930
To request something?

227
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,890
As the King issued a royal order to me.

228
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,560
A royal order?

229
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,610
Is this a military authorization tag?

230
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,930
The King granted me the authorization power over the five military departments,

231
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:15,310
and ordered me to take Yi In Jwa to death without fail,

232
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,910
even by mobilizing the military.

233
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,410
 There must be some who are in collusion with Yi In Jwa. 

234
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,450
 There must be someone who knows the traitor Jeong. 

235
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,450
 Nobody can keep Yi In Jwa from execution by beheading. 

236
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,190
 Because these words without feet have already  

237
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,710
traveled 1000 li (about 250 miles), the traitors' hands and feet are  tied.

238
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:55,300
You're rude. Just by the Royal Father's arbitrary decision, without a criminal interrogation, Yi In Jwa—

239
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,010
Yi In Jwa is a traitor.

240
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:10,000
Your Highness, you can't move even one step until Yi In Jwa's execution.

241
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,820
Moreover, you can't reach out your help to him at all.

242
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,480
Geum, are you threatening me right now?

243
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:30,560
This Prince Yeoning dares to offer honest advice to you at the risk of my life.

244
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,870
Your Highness, tomorrow, without fail,

245
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,150
I'll end Yi In Jwa's evil deed.

246
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:36,030
From this time on, until Yi In Jwa's execution is complete,

247
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,950
all military authorization is left to this Prince Yeoning.

248
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,710
So heed what I'm saying, Crown Prince's bodyguards.

249
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,670
Put your lives on the line to protect His Highness the Crown Prince.

250
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,320
- Do you understand? 
- Yes, Your Highness.

251
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,790
 Close the four gates to the Capital, and do not allow anyone to enter or leave excepting those with stage horse identification. 

252
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,890
 From this point on, the Royal Investigation Bureau will be guarded by the Capital Bureau 

253
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:28,590
 No invasion or jailbreak by any person shall be tolerated 

254
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,860
It is His Highness's will to save you. So please go inside.

255
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,640
 Since it is an earnest plea. Do not interfere. 

256
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,780
 Make sure that my two hands 

257
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,460
 don't arrest you. 

258
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,620
What are you planning to do with that sword?

259
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,400
What. Are you really planning to save Yi In Jwa?

260
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,280
If so, are you going to draw your sword?

261
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,380
If necessary.

262
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,090
Would any a younger brother put a sword in his older brother's path?

263
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,230
And would any older brother block the way of his younger brother?

264
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,960
Don't think needless thoughts.

265
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,040
What are you planning to do?

266
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,200
By now you should have an answer whether you will save Yi In Jwa or not.

267
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,380
If you want to hear the answer, show your face first!

268
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,800
Did you meet the traitor Jeong?

269
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,180
By chance, did you come because you can't trust me?

270
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:31,020
Is there anyone who wouldn't be shaken after learning that his father, believed to be dead, was actually alive?

271
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,740
My father isn't a weak person.

272
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,380
I will save him no matter what.

273
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,940
Royal Mother is seeking you.

274
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,810
Come to the palace early tomorrow.

275
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,930
Just greeting to Royal Mother.

276
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,320
Well.

277
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,830
 Father, just be alive. 

278
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,260
Your Highness, you must lie down.

279
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,490
I'm not dying.

280
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
Yi In Jwa.

281
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,280
Until that beast of a man dies,

282
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,790
I cannot close my eyes.

283
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,600
 Baek Dae Gil. 

284
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,670
 This is truly your choice? 

285
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,120
This visit must have been difficult for you to make.

286
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,540
This is a filial piety, isn't it?

287
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,750
Thank you.

288
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,030
Thank you so much.

289
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,740
So it's today.  Yi In Jwa's last day.

290
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,200
In two hours, he will be executed.

291
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,320
Yi In Jwa, his death,

292
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,710
I had wanted to see with my eyes but I will watch

293
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,630
from here.

294
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,480
You two, listen to your mothers well.

295
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,050
Trust each other and help each other.

296
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,240
You are brothers, are you not?

297
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,130
The one closest to you above everyone else in this world.

298
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,730
 Do not worry. 

299
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,650
 Your mom will protect you. 

300
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,300
 Even in death, 

301
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,700
 I will protect you two. 

302
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,710
Then, Royal Mother, I will take my leave.

303
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,070
Your Highness.

304
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,630
You are very beautiful today.

305
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,370
- Is that so? 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

306
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,560
Stand up. Everyone is waiting.

307
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,560
 My, Yi In Jwa's fate only amounts to this? 

308
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,900
 To overthrow Joseon and complete the great cause, 

309
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,450
 my, Yi In Jwa's, fate 

310
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,460
 only amounts to this? 

311
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,730
Move aside.

312
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,300
 Baek Dae Gil, I believe in you. 

313
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,390
 Baek Dae Gil, it's not too late yet. 

314
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,840
It's not too late yet.

315
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,540
 Why are you faltering?  You can do this. 

316
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,580
I'm the only one who can save you.

317
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,300
 Save me at once, I said! 

318
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,720
So say it.  Where is my father?

319
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,850
 Salvation Tag 

320
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,350
 Salvation Tag 

321
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,600
There is only one path for you to choose.

322
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,560
To save your father and to save me.

323
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,100
 At the moment, Baek Man Geum 

324
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,720
 is at a place where his life hangs on a word from me. 

325
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,800
 Well, what are you going to do? 

326
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,960
Save me at once and save your father.

327
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,680
Lies until your death?  How fitting of you.

328
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,770
- What?
- You...

329
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,750
- are finished now.  
 - You bastard!

330
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,700
 Father. 

331
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,780
Carry out the execution.

332
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,580
 Watch closely! 

333
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,280
This is not the end.

334
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,210
I, Yi In Jwa,

335
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:36,540
will not die at last.

336
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,560
 Even if I am to become a ghost 

337
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,210
 I will change this Joseon for sure. 

338
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,910
 So with your eyes clearly open, 

339
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,230
 watch me closely. 

340
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,450
 Stop! 

341
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,920
 Stop. 

342
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,450
- What's the problem? 
 - Your Highness.

343
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,510
Noble Royal Consort Sook just...

344
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,510
What about her?

345
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:32,190
Noble Royal Consort Sook... has passed away.

346
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,060
What... is this?

347
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,870
Your Highness.

348
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,940
Carry out the execution at once!

349
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,280
- Right this instant! 
 - Stop!

350
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,830
Royal Consort Sook has died.

351
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,870
From this moment forward, until the funeral is carried out,

352
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,610
a ban on punishments will be imposed.

353
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,190
And death sentences cannot be carried out.

354
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,120
You must have watched it clearly.

355
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,950
That Yi In Jwa is not one to die easily at last.

356
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,730
Yi In Jwa.

357
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:02,820
 Royal Mother, forgive your son. 

358
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,800
Die, Yi In Jwa!

359
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,700
Your Highness.

360
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,830
- There are many eyes watching.
- Let go.

361
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,650
If not today, then tomorrow.

362
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,970
If not tomorrow, then someday, Yi In Jwa will surely die by my hand.

363
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,790
Your Highness.

364
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,050
 Your Highness! 

365
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,710
 Your Highness! 

366
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,450
Mo...

367
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,980
Royal Mother.

368
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,810
Please wake up.

369
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,510
Royal Mother.

370
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,600
Your son is here, Royal Mother.

371
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,960
 Royal Mother! 

372
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,790
 Royal Mother! 

373
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,720
 Who are you? 

374
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,060
 I am Baek Dae Gil. 

375
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,350
 Are you all right? 

376
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,180
  Forgive me. 

377
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,750
 Trust each other and help each other. 

378
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,850
 Royal Mother, please wake up. 

379
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,890
 Royal Mother! 

380
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,480
 I just barely met you.  

381
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,830
 I haven't given you a grand smile yet. 

382
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,470
 How can you leave so soon? 

383
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,020
 Mother. 

384
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,240
I can't preside over the funeral?

385
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,550
I am the son.  How is it that I can't preside over the funeral?

386
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,020
Your Highness, for a long time,

387
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,220
you have been registered as Queen Inhyeon's adopted son.

388
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,820
Do you think no one knows that?

389
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,250
I don't care.

390
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:59,870
This very moment!  Bring me mourning attire!

391
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:04,220
- Forgive me, Your Highness. 
 - Forgive us, Your Highness.

392
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,110
Are you not going to heed my words?

393
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:11,850
Right now!  Bring me my mourning robe!

394
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,300
Go right now!

395
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,420
 Come by. 

396
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:03,930
 Go well.  Having met a foolish husband,  

397
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:08,010
 you have toiled.  You really have. 

398
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:13,060
 I'm very sorry. Very sorry.  

399
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,330
Crown Prince, even if there's a ban on punishments,

400
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:24,480
the custom excludes high traitors.

401
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,260
Yi In Jwa's execution cannot be postponed any longer.

402
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:33,900
Your Excellency, Prime Minister. Royal Consort Sook has passed away, but to carry out an execution?

403
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,170
It's a given.

404
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,450
Crown Prince, this is not the way.

405
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:42,500
Yi In Jwa, not one moment...

406
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,370
It's a courageous decision made by the regent, His Highness the Crown Prince. Why do you...

407
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,730
To carry out an execution of a high traitor...

408
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,740
is not a matter that requires the courageous decision of His Highness the Crown Prince.

409
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:32,750
Please... postpone the execution.

410
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,820
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness.

411
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,260
As her son!

412
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,620
My royal mother's death...

413
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,270
I cannot allow it to be disgraced.

414
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,860
Why have you sought me again?

415
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,950
Your teacher survived, and I came presuming your answer might have changed.

416
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:45,450
My will has not changed.

417
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,430
I still, with my hands,

418
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,810
plan to kill my teacher.

419
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,950
Do not deceive yourself.

420
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:07,350
You should verify yourself, your true intention and your teacher's true intention.

421
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,350
It's only for a moment, so return quickly.

422
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,350
Dam Seo.

423
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,950
So, how have you been?

424
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,370
You've withered a lot.

425
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,230
I am ashamed.

426
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:13,910
So then did you come to rescue me or to kill me?

427
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,650
I will pull you out of here.

428
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:21,670
I will collect your life afterward.

429
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:33,150
This is the last repayment I can give you.

430
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,550
Go now.

431
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:59,150
Do you wish to be in the band of traitors?  I don't need your help, so leave now.

432
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:06,590
 Verify yourself, your true intention and your teacher's true intention. 

433
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,350
Go back, I said!

434
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:19,350
If I must offer my life for the sake of this nation Joseon, I shall.

435
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:23,470
However, if it's to replace this rotten crumbling Joseon

436
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:31,030
and to open a new nation, for that great cause I will do it.

437
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:35,550
Hence, Dam Seo, you go on your path.

438
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,530
Go back, I said!

439
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,120
 That child's pain must be followed by the paying of responsibility. 

440
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,550
 Baek Dae Gil,  

441
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:37,010
 and Prince Yeoning as well, all need that responsibility. 

442
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,810
Did you summon me?

443
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,290
What are you thinking?

444
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,850
To postpone Yi In Jwa's execution, your reason!

445
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,630
However, Her Consortship Sook still...

446
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:54,110
Stuff that useless babbling.

447
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:06,230
What is your true intention in shielding that man?

448
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,530
Please spare him.

449
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,870
What?

450
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:15,830
Yi In Jwa.  Please spare that man Yi In Jwa.

451
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:24,470
Do you even know that man's true thought?

452
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:30,150
Royal Father, it's a misunderstanding.

453
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,130
Misunderstanding?

454
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:36,870
The day Royal Mother was exiled.

455
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:41,290
The day Royal Father cast out Royal Mother,

456
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:45,770
that man Yi In Jwa extended his hand to me.

457
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,010
 I grabbed baduk pieces.  If I were to grab white pieces, 

458
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,630
 he said he would save me. 

459
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:57,510
Those baduk pieces!  Did you think there were any black ones?

460
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:01,190
It was his scheme from the beginning to bewitch you!

461
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,230
Do you truly not know that?

462
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:06,030
It was not that I did not  know.

463
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:11,010
I knew, but I still wanted to lean on him. I on him!

464
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:18,370
On that one and only person who extended a hand to me on that day, I wished to lean on him.

465
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,850
Shut your mouth!

466
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:28,370
How can you fall into his witchcraft, unable to escape it?

467
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:37,490
He advocated for me and protected me and gave me power.

468
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:41,190
He promised me he'd have me ascend to the royal throne!

469
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,510
Do you truly wish to die?

470
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:02,210
You play the fool in the grasp of some petty beast.

471
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:07,250
And you call yourself a crown prince of a nation,

472
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,110
the foundation of this nation?

473
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:16,830
Now, that Yi In Jwa's neck, I will...

Royal Father!

00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,370
 You prescribed opium to His Majesty? 

483
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,530
 I declare the scholar Yi In Jwa to be innocent of crime and order his release. 

484
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,090
 And his subordinates as well will receive a special pardon. 

485
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:58,490
 I thought you died and I was looking for you everywhere! 

486
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,190
 As a Byeol Warrior? 

487
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:01,090
 Yi In Jwa recommended you. 

488
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,950
 The distrust will spread 

489
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,150
  faster than anything else. 

490
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,790
 Joseon's best swordsman, Kim Che Geon. 

491
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,590
 He will collect your teacher's life. 

492
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,290
 Come out.  Dam Seo went where? 

493
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:14,410
 - Kill Yi In Jwa... 
 - Anything you want to say, say it to the King of Hell. 

494
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,770
 If you will slay my teacher, you will need to slay me first. 

495
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:19,390
 No! 

496
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,840
