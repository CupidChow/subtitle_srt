 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

3
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,700
Who're you?

4
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,600
Get out of my way!

5
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,430
Just because you tell me to move, doesn't mean I have to move.

6
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,280
You're being rude.

7
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,120
Call Hong Seol Joo immediately!

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,810
Hong Seol Joo?

9
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,890
Just because you're dressed fancy, did you lose your mind?

10
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:13,750
Hey Lady! Hurry up and get lost while I'm still talking nicely!

11
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,210
W-Who are you?

12
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,600
Hey. You're being rude.

13
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,390
Aigoo!

14
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,050
T-That person!

15
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,120
Ah wait...

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,100
I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding!

17
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,870
These bastards are disturbing the sleeping tiger!

18
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,850
Aigoo! Aish!

19
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,260
Aish!

20
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,090
Huh? This bastard...

21
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,200
What the heck!  How dare you come in—

22
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,850
Oh, you're that lady.

23
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,520
Where is the teacher?

24
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,200
He's over there.

25
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,240
Go! Go!

26
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,690
Wow! This place is huge.

27
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,510
Yup, it has to be at least this big to have a good match.

28
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,740
Right?

29
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,530
- Do you know each other? 
 - No, I do not.

30
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,920
What do you mean you don't? We've met, so now we know each other.

31
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,150
Anyhow, you look like a fair lady, but why do your hands look so rough?

32
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,930
I'm sorry, Teacher.

33
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,970
It's dangerous for a lady to be walking around alone, right?

34
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,300
So this guy is your tujeon teacher, right? 
 (traditional Korean card game) 

35
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,980
Why is a young lady like you just playing tujeon instead of getting married?

36
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,740
And also, usually with tujeon, you need to learn it from a skilled player like me.

37
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,480
But this guy seems to be quite old, and has a bit of a weird gleam in his eye.

38
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,440
Watch.

39
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,610
Well... Well this is s-supposed to change so...

40
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,140
Do you want a drink?

41
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,930
Of course I do!

42
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
If you have no more business with us, you should...

43
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,920
Business? Of course I still have some business with you folks.

44
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,710
I've marked this lady to be my wife from today on.

45
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,730
You little!

46
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,940
Other people may not know it, but I know from just one glance

47
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,190
that you are going to be my wife.

48
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,450
Do you really want to d-die?!

49
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,840
 Now, now. 

50
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,800
Sit down. He's just at the prime of his youth.

51
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,500
Forgive me.

52
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,870
Thanks to you, I had an enjoyable time.

53
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,990
Follow me.

54
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,960
If my wife is leaving, I will have to go as well!

55
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,610
Ouch! That's hot!

56
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,620
Hey you twerp, acting like an adult already. Do you really want to get married that badly?

57
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,890
Well,

58
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,350
you can start by paying the bills first.

59
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,790
I think we have a misunderstanding. Those people will pay the bills.

60
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,780
Those dishes were your girl's.

61
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,230
And the dishes here, you ate them.

62
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,050
Is this enough?

63
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,730
As a commemoration of me meeting my wife today, it's on me,

64
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,210
so take this and don't be too grateful.

65
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,970
Hey, kid, looking at your attire, you'll have a funeral before your wedding.

66
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,410
But don't be too upset, I'll at least take care of your expenses for you to go to the afterlife.

67
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,340
Here.

68
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,410
The thing that moves this world

69
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,410
is not the King or the high ranking officials, but money.

70
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,670
Just

71
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,900
money.

72
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,920
Starting today, you take care of this, Dam Seo.

73
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,780
Yes, Teacher.

74
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,940
Aish!

75
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,900
This bastard. As he eats a lot, he must have a long life line.

76
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,300
While seeing you off to the afterlife, I might just die before you out of impatience.

77
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,230
It seems you've appeared again when we were having so much fun, My Lord.

78
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,690
Stand him up.

79
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,260
So, you're a gambler going all over Joseon Peninsula, right?

80
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,430
Why don't you take a guess? Is it heads or tails?

81
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,620
- It's heads. 
- Are you confident?

82
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,670
I'll even bet my hand that it's heads.

83
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,540
You're willing to bet your hand over one nyang?

84
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,570
If not, I'll be your servant.

85
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,580
This kid... hm...

86
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,380
What is your name?

87
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,660
My name?

88
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,540
W-What's so important with names, anyway?

89
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,110
- It's G-Gae Ttong. 
 - What? Gae Ttong?

90
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,300
Is that even a name for a person?

91
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,730
Just send him off.

92
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,480
Okay.

93
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,800
- Thanks. 
 - Wait.

94
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,750
A man who knows the importance of one nyang is a true gambler.

95
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,670
Anyway, you're this Gae Ttong's wife,

96
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,790
so don't have any other thoughts.

97
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,300
Hong Seol Joo.

98
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,110
Yes, My Lord.

99
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,960
Do you think this gambling den is still yours?

100
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,080
What should I say?

101
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,500
It's kind of... puzzling... to answer.

102
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,510
It's obviously yours.

103
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,040
 Prince Yeoning (the future King Yeongjo) 

104
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,320
This liquor, the liquor has run out.

105
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,980
What are you doing, not getting more liquor?

106
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,710
Did you swallow the brazier?

107
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,490
It seems like your mouth is about to spout flames.

108
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,970
What?

109
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,050
What? What are you going to do just by glaring?

110
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,010
Why this—

111
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,290
You pay.

112
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,800
What?

113
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,960
Sorry.

114
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,970
 Hey, put in money and get money. One nyang will become two, 

115
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,770
and 10 nyangs will become 20.

116
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,870
Here, here!

117
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,060
Okay! Not there!

118
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,780
Here. If you get this right, I'll give you double.

119
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,280
If you get this wrong, you lose everything.

120
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,220
Choose one.

121
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,540
I don't think it's that one.

122
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,960
It's only daytime and you're already drunk.

123
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,370
Don't meddle. Originally, the gamble has to be followed by 70% of luck and 30% of spirit.

124
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,240
I have good luck and a high spirit.

125
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,420
Since you met me, you're right about being lucky.

126
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,300
What is he saying?

127
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,470
Okay.

128
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,430
Open these two first.

129
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,020
Why? Should I open it for you?

130
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,570
Since these two are empty, I must be right.

131
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,650
Why? Isn't that right?

132
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,610
Well, open it, then.

133
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,370
It's double.

134
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,800
Thank you.

135
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:37,010
It seems like all you have is your body.

136
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,510
You should conserve even one nyang.

137
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,290
Are the rumors true? Does he act like a hooligan?

138
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,640
Yes. In the daytime, he's already drunk, gambling, and even getting into fights.

139
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,480
But, his wise eyes are still the same.

140
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,960
I think I will have to confirm it with my own two eyes.

141
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,400
Grandpa, what are you doing, not sleeping?

142
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,740
Aish, really.

143
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,960
Why do I keep hallucinating?

144
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,770
Relax your shoulders. Here, straight.

145
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,250
Become my wife.

146
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,820
Would you become my wife?

147
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,920
Have you been following me?

148
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Am I a dog? Why would I follow you?

149
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,990
That hand.

150
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,770
From the calluses on the palm of your left hand and on the thumb and index finger of your right hand,

151
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,100
I can tell you enjoy archery.

152
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,250
And you're a young lady at the blooming age.

153
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,970
Then, what are you? You must be an archery teacher for women.

154
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,270
Stop bothering me.

155
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,660
Gosh, couldn't I at least know your name?

156
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,580
This flower...

157
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,460
Next time, I will slice your neck.

158
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,270
Why is she pretty even when she's angry?

159
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,560
Oh, my! I've never seen you before.

160
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,590
A palanquin bearer.

161
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,730
Come here. I will make you feel good today.

162
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,100
Well I... I don't have much m-money...

163
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,890
Oh come on! We all know palanquin bearers make lots of money.

164
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,640
Don't be like that and just come here.

165
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,700
Orabeoni, why are you so irritable?
 (orabeoni: archaic equivalent of oppa) 

166
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,230
Did something bad happen?

167
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,810
Irritable?

168
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,020
Let's just drink!

169
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,300
Sit down. I said sit.

170
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,050
Why are you so shy?

171
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh my! Look at his arms!

172
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,470
He must have really carried some palanquins before.

173
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,110
Oh my! Look at his thighs!

174
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,620
You are touching my leg so casually.

175
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,510
In order to express my gratitude for your attendance here at the Wol Hyang Restaurant,

176
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,770
we have prepared a special performance,

177
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,270
so please enjoy.

178
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,770
 Tonight, Prince Yeoning will go to the Wol Hyang Restaurant, 

179
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,360
 so remember his face well. 

180
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,260
 Prince Yeoning. The King's child. 

181
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,350
 My enemy. 

182
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,540
What are you up to?! Huh?! Nice seeing you again!

183
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,320
- You again? 
 - Who are you staring so intently at, huh?!

184
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,440
Do you want me to pull out your eyeballs?

185
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,020
Is that woman even your lover?

186
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,550
What?

187
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,430
Of course she is! She's my lover!

188
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,870
She's going to be my wife, so mind your own business!

189
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,650
And don't appear in front of me again!

190
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,140
What will you do if I don't do that?

191
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,360
It seems that my girl's beauty is so astounding,

192
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,050
that the two of you have lost your rationality.

193
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,370
If you really want my girl, then let's do it this way.

194
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,740
The person with the lowest number will win.

195
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,670
And the person who wins will win my girl.

196
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,440
Good. But...

197
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,910
a win without a loss is not a win at all.

198
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,080
Fine. I won't state this twice.

199
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,630
What about stripping our clothes off? Even the underwear.

200
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,840
Fine. A man will not go back upon his word.

201
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,180
No turning back.

202
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,650
Have I not told you this before? I'm a gambler.

203
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,580
A gambler, you say?

204
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,740
We definitely said that the person with the lowest number will win.

205
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,330
- There's nothing, so I win.
- What is this?

206
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,380
- What kind of bullshit is this?! 
- There was only one rule.

207
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,310
Didn't you say the person with the lowest number would win?

208
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,430
You wouldn't go back on your word,  now would you?

209
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,140
Strip. Your underwear as well.

210
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:55,020
Ah, this is something you couldn't see even if you paid for it.

211
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,100
But you should have just drunk. You should not have started to bet people on the line.

212
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,440
Isn't this against the nation's law?

213
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,190
Your Highness, Prince Yeoning.

214
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,870
It's you again?

215
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,290
Ah, do you know who I am?

216
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,730
You dig around me behind my back like a rat,

217
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,310
so how could I not possibly know you?

218
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,500
Lee In Jwa.

219
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,150
Ah, was there another fate like this?  (What a coincidence) 

220
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,340
Because of a single rat that has been digging around the gambling den recently,

221
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,130
I too have been getting severe headaches trying to find it.

222
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,990
Your Highness, what should we do now?

223
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,550
While Your Highness was gambling away,

224
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,880
it so happened that the Chief of Investigation

225
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,360
was present here as well.

226
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,290
Please forgive my interruption.

227
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,990
If you're done drinking, come out now!

228
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,040
Yes, Sir!

229
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,660
Move!

230
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,120
You dare to arrest me?

231
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,770
With my little power, how could I arrest you, Your Highness?

232
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,670
But these people, who have broken the nation's law,

233
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,370
will not be able to escape their punishment.

234
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,780
No matter how strict the nation's law is,

235
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,830
I was just enjoying myself a bit,

236
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,470
so I'm sure you can overlook this incident just once.

237
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,480
If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I might have.

238
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,510
But I'm deeply sorry, Your Highness.

239
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,980
WAIT!

240
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:02,950
L-Look here. This lady has done nothing wrong.

241
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,740
- Done nothing wrong? 
 - Yes, Sir.

242
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,690
I was the one who made the bet,

243
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,280
and I am the one who caused a ruckus by taking my clothes off.

244
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,090
So how could you say that that lady has committed any wrong?

245
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,960
You're being rude!

246
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,220
Regardless of gender or age or status,

247
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:23,830
it is the nation's strict law to punish everyone who participates in this type of gambling!

248
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,660
Then if that's the case, the punishment that that lady would receive,

249
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,550
I will accept it instead.

250
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:42,630
Do you not even know that even a strong and healthy man can become maimed or even die from 30 lashes?

251
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,440
I don't care.

252
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
Is that so?

253
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,310
Then I will fulfill your foolish wish.

254
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,810
Take him away.

255
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,900
Why didn't you

256
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,540
inform me you were going to do this?

257
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,320
If I had informed you, what difference would it have made?

258
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,110
Because of me, an innocent man is about to be punished.

259
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,300
Then that must be that man's fate.

260
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,980
You. Come see me.

261
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,920
Did this event take place because of me?

262
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,680
That was not planned to harm you, Your Highness.

263
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,260
I'm not sure whether you mind someone else's business too much in believing my hyungnim (Crown Prince) is backing you up.

264
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,550
I just wanted to see if the rumors that were going around were true.

265
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:59,800
The rumor that during the day, you're an alcoholic, and during the night, you are a playboy.

266
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,830
And so, you have no interest or ambition in politics.

267
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,100
And? Were you able to confirm it?

268
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,920
It seems it is raining.

269
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,900
Before it becomes a heavy downfall, you should get going.

270
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,290
So what did you see?

271
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,810
He is a tiger.

272
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,380
And on top of all that, there's not just one tiger, but two.

273
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,870
I was also quite surprised.

274
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,300
I never thought there would be a person who had the same physiognomy as yours, My Lord.

275
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,700
It can't be... You're saying that person has the traitor's features as I do?

276
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,500
Twenty eight!

277
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,050
I'm Gae Ttong! I won't die!

278
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,770
Twenty nine!

279
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I SAID I'M GAE TTONG!

280
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,620
Thirty!

281
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,250
Aigoo, I thought you abandoned me.

282
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,880
Dam Seo.

283
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,270
Huh?

284
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,060
That's my name.

285
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,630
Ah, Dam Seo? Well this must be fate—

286
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,960
What are you doing?

287
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,990
Aigoo, just take it!

288
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:19,030
Since I'm healthy, I don't need things like that. Watch.

289
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,980
Are you an idiot?

290
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,950
Why would you carelessly mistreat your body like that?

291
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,290
Did you think someone would acknowledge you for doing that?

292
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,750
Well no... I was just...

293
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,370
No matter how hard you try, no one will recognize you.

294
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,760
You will just be a person who will never escape being poor.

295
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,950
You have a lowly life like that.

296
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,490
I!

297
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,110
I just need one person to acknowledge me.

298
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,020
Just one person. And that is the woman who will be my bride.

299
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,470
Hey what happened to your bottom? Were you beaten with a cudgel someplace else?

300
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,590
Why, this little brat must have caused trouble again as soon as we got to Hanyang!

301
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,010
Hey, you! Why are you acting like this?

302
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,320
H-hey, G-Gae Ttong!

303
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,020
Gae Ttong!

304
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,480
Father! Why am I Gae Ttong?

305
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,630
Just come out here!

306
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,930
I'm asking you why I am Gae Ttong.

307
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,580
You said I was a noble.

308
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,200
So why?

309
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:56,310
So why? Out of all the chances in heaven, why did I come out worse than a beggar?

310
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,750
Just why?!

311
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,350
 Crown Prince Yoon (later Gyeongjong, King of Joseon) 

312
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,160
Bull's eye!

313
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,180
How have you been, Your Highness?

314
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,650
I...

315
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,470
have been well all thanks to you. But why have you come here today?

316
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,650
Today I came to see His Majesty and  to lessen your worry.

317
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,590
You want to see His Majesty?

318
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:47,970
Yes, but for now, Your Highness just needs to shoot some arrows with me.

319
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,670
 King. 

320
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,310
 Sookjong 

321
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,990
He is my baduk teacher.

322
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,810
A baduk teacher you say...

323
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,670
My name is Lee In Jwa.

324
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:15,240
Your Majesty. May I dare to request a baduk game with you?

325
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,870
You want a baduk game with me?

326
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

327
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:43,610
I'll let you have a 10-stone advantage.

328
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,320
10 stones?

329
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:54,130
I think you really have something you wish to tell me about.

330
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,510
You have no fear.

331
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,730
You're sitting in front of  the King of this country

332
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:12,970
and yet you seem to have no fear and seem dignified.

333
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,370
It's almost as if you are becoming the King.

334
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,680
You speak highly of me. How could I ever dream of that?

335
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,830
The previous General of Training,  Lee Heun Jin, and the Left Prime Minister Lee Won Jin,

336
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,100
were your grandparents, right?

337
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,170
What? Did you really think that I would not know that?

338
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,340
Being a baduk teacher is a good disguise. But the truth is, you're planning to hide behind the weak Crown Prince

339
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,480
and govern everything yourself, right?

340
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,520
How could I ever possibly do such a thing? You speak too highly of me, Your Majesty.

341
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,360
Do you resent me?

342
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:18,270
Actually. Do you want to kill me?

343
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,750
Because I am the man who ruined your family.

344
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,500
Me.

345
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:34,190
Your Majesty, the ones who were blinded by greed, and the ones who were involved in the factional war,

346
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,550
how could you not have taken those measures against those officials?

347
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,270
I do not resent you.

348
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,070
The three Changes of State spanning Gyeongshin Year (1680), Gisa Year (1689) and Gapsul Year (1694).

349
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:53,840
That was the result of your great decision for the people of Joseon, Your Majesty.

350
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,950
Raise your head.

351
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,040
You really mean it.

352
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,510
Your eyes tell me you really meant it.

353
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,880
So what is your reason for using the baduk teacher disguise to see me?

354
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,020
Your Majesty. I'm sure you already know the answer to your question.

355
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,860
What is your reason for being so hesitant?

356
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,150
I am here to tell you

357
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:41,700
about regency.

358
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,240
Let me hear your reasons.

359
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,470
If we have the Crown Prince govern, the Norons  ("Old Learning," one of the two political factions in the court)  will be against that,

360
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:10,350
but if we don't do that, the Sorons  ("New Learning," the other of the two political factions in the Court)  will also not be pleased.

361
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:16,340
But Your Majesty, it is said that no one can stop water with just their bare hands,

362
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,940
and therefore, no one can stop a flowing river.

363
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:27,030
The decision to let the Crown Prince govern is just like the flow and current of the river.  (meaning it is bound to happen) 

364
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:30,640
So, why are you worrying unnecessarily about this decision?

365
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,690
Worrying unnecessarily?

366
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,190
Is that so? Then it's quite an easy decision.

367
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,370
But you.

368
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,650
Do you know of a 100-eyed, 1000-eared monster?

369
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,300
Are you talking about a monster that rains blood and eats human flesh?

370
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,140
So you do know. Do you perhaps

371
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,930
wish to become that monster?

372
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,410
You speak too highly, Your Majesty.

373
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:19,730
I just wish to be the Crown Prince's baduk teacher, no more no less.

374
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,760
That is all I want.

375
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,520
Is that so?

376
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,720
Then that means you will have no interest in politics.

377
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:40,460
How could a person like me ever wish to participate in politics?

379
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,440
How did it go?

380
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,680
Do you know of a 100-eyed and 1000-eared

381
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,330
monster?

382
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,890
Huh?

383
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,510
 Even though I may have no interest in politics 

384
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,910
 I do have an interest in that throne. 

385
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,030
 Just you wait. One day, I will definitely 

386
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,530
 take that throne from you. 

387
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:49,510
How long are you going to live like that? Every day, all you do is drink, play with women, play tujeon, and even fist-fight!

388
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,000
As a descendant of the King, are you not embarrassed? How could you be such a hooligan—

389
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,580
Yes! I am a hooligan!

390
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,340
So what if I am a hooligan? So what if I am a playboy?

391
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,890
If I live like this or that, what difference does it make?

392
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:14,010
Royal Mother should also stop caring for me now!

393
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,070
Royal Mother!

394
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:28,120
For now, learn to be more respectful and careful. That is the punishment I am giving to you as a mother.

395
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:43,740
 Royal Mother. Was that good enough? Would that do?
Lady Sook Bin Choi 

396
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,930
 You did well. You endured it very well. 

397
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:54,450
 Please endure it over and over again. You have to survive this in order to benefit. 

398
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,850
 You must survive if you wish to inherit the throne. 

399
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,770
 It seems the once-lowly water maid is sitting on the top of power now. 

400
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:17,260
 This is all thanks to you, My Lord. 

401
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,620
Wait. How were you able to gather that much?

402
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,940
Father! What is all this?

403
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:49,740
What do you mean, "What is this?" That's the money we're going to use to make you a noble.

404
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,560
N-Noble?

405
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,780
What are you doing, brat? Hurry and take off your clothes!

406
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,720
What are you doing? Hurry up!

407
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,330
H-H-Hot!

408
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,430
If you do this, it will cool down a bit.

409
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,500
Sheesh, making such a big deal out of this.

410
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,000
What are you complaining for? What? Are you embarrassed?

411
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,430
This is nothing to be embarrassed about when it's between father and son!

412
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:18,120
I said I'll do this by myself.

413
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,520
You brat. It won't be enough to spend a whole night cleaning your 20-year-old dirt. Hurry and take it off!

414
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,770
Woah! Woah!

415
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,760
Why are you doing this?

416
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,250
You're as big as a cow, but you're such a crybaby.

417
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:32,770
Aigoo.

418
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,970
Ow! Ow! Ow!

419
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,740
- Come over here! 
 - I told you before to not hit my butt!

420
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,340
- Come here! 
 - I'm going to splash you with water if you come any closer!

421
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,190
I'm going to splash it!

422
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,350
Do I look good?

423
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,570
Here, turn around a bit!

424
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,550
My back side? How is it?

425
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,530
Wow! You look nice! Here, turn around again!

426
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,510
How is it?

427
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,160
The clothes you have will be wasted with that face.

428
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,950
Aish! What are you saying? Look at this face!

429
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,100
Hey, turn around! Turn around!

430
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,580
Father.

431
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,930
If you're a noble, don't you have a noble name?

432
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,220
A noble name?

433
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,750
Of course you do. It's in the family registry.

434
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,230
Family registry?

435
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,670
What's the point having lots of customers?  They're meaningless  (as all the profit will go to Lee In Jwa). 

436
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:47,430
He isn't my husband. How am I seeing things?

437
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,720
This place is the same as usual.

438
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,320
And you're also the same as usual.

439
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,860
Is this really you, Orabeoni?  (older brother) 

440
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,840
I don't have a sweet relationship with Orabeoni like this. So what's the matter?

441
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:08,210
After making some money, and sleeping in warm places...

442
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,070
Get to the point.

443
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,430
There is one thing that's been on my mind still.

444
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,280
The family registry.

445
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,520
 Isn't a noble's family registry practically money? 

446
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,300
 No! I said you can't have the family registry! 

447
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,350
 Hold still! 

448
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,410
 No! I said you can't have that! 

449
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:32,100
So what's the point of coming back now to look for it?

450
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,090
It's for a child. My child.

451
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:42,690
Wow. For that newborn baby? Well, too bad. The family registry isn't here anymore.

452
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,120
Actually, Orabeoni. Do you have 300 nyangs?

453
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,680
If you can pay me that, I have ways of getting it back.

454
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,240
 Family Registry 

455
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,010
Family Registry? Could this be the family registry?

456
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,750
It is the family registry! The registry!

457
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,810
From now on, your name will be Dae Gil.

458
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,360
Baek Dae Gil!

459
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,350
The 13th generation in the Nampo Baek clan, Baek Dae Gil!

460
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,980
Dae Gil? Baek Dae Gil?

461
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:17,690
I am no longer Gae Ttong.

462
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,610
I'm a noble! A noble I say!

463
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,680
I'm a noble now!

464
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,530
Dae Gil! He is the 13th generation in the Nampo Baek clan, Baek Dae Gil!

465
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,690
Sook Bin's child?

466
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,050
That Gae Ttong is Baek Man Geum's child?

467
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:38,010
Yes! He even came back to buy back the family registry.

468
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:41,990
Fate is quite a hard thing to predict.

469
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,910
Are you there, Dam Seo?

470
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:54,900
Tonight, with one man's death, we will start the first step of our plans.

471
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:01,230
Dam Seo, you personally instigate the plan.

472
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,840
My Lord! Would you accept my drink?

473
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,530
You'll give me a drink?

474
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,780
Oh wait, My Lord!

475
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,880
My Lord. Your name... You don't seem you have your name as Gae Ttong...

476
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,060
- I'm Baek Dae Gil.
 - Alright! 

477
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,180
Baek Dae Gil! He's Baek Dae Gil!

478
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,070
My Lord! Which generation of Nampo Baek clan are you from?

479
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,520
The... The...

480
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,970
Actually, I totally forgot it!

481
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,710
You are the 13th generation!

482
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:41,120
You are the 13th generation of Nampo Baek clan, Baek Dae Gil!

483
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,290
My Lord! Haha!

484
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,610
- Hey look. 
 - Man, the moon is so bright.

485
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,950
It seems our orabeoni will easily find the way to go to the afterlife.

486
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,790
Why are you here at this hour, Sister?

487
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,750
I do feel bad telling you this when you address me as Sister,

488
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,690
but don't be too upset with me. I'll even bury you in a sunny place.

489
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:14,490
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

490
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,710
Well anyway, today is a good day,

491
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:23,400
so stop dawdling around here and just go home.

492
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,900
I do feel a little bad about this. Oh, what should I do?

493
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,970
On a great day like this,

494
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:46,160
do you really want to feel the fury of this noble, Dae Gil's fists?

495
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,780
Dae Gil!

496
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,700
Hey, kid, next time don't interfere.

497
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,730
Since you were the one who drew the blade first,

498
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,900
don't resent me, okay?

499
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,240
Noonim! Aigoo, Noonim!

500
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,600
Let's leave Hanyang!

501
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,960
There is nothing more for us to do here! Let's go!

502
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:24,600
 You must not kill Baek Dae Gil. 

503
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:30,410
He talks sh*t. You're telling me to hold it in when I've been attacked like this? Huh?!

504
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:34,370
Hey, get your weapons ready! I'm going to end this all today!

505
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:35,240
Which way did they go?

506
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,030
That way! T-That w-way!

507
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,690
Are you alright? Gae Ttong!

508
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,530
Are you okay?

509
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,000
Of course I'm alright. Do you think I'll die like  this? 

510
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,940
If I die like this, I am not your son.

511
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,840
That's right. You just need to survive. You can do anything as long as you survive.

512
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,290
Gae Ttong, let's go.

513
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,330
Stop wasting your time talking, and let's move!

514
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,920
Let's go! Let's go!

515
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,790
- Let's go! 
 - There's a boat over there!

516
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,150
Get in the boat quickly. Hurry!

517
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,520
Push it!

518
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,500
Let's go, let's go!

519
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,960
Shoot them.

520
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,220
But—

521
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,920
Why are you hesitating?

522
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,340
During your time here, did you fall in love with that man?

523
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,220
That's not it.

524
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:58,550
  Anyway, you are this Gae Ttong's bride, so don't think otherwise. 

525
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,270
 I! 

526
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:06,470
  I just need one person who will acknowledge me. 

527
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:11,290
  Just one person, the woman who will be my bride. 

528
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,510
Teacher, I—

529
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,830
Hurry and row!

530
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,940
  One day, I will take your child from you. 

531
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,070
Gae Ttong...

532
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:07,650
Gae Ttong? I am Dae Gil. Baek Dae  Gil.

533
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,150
Gae Ttong...

534
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,580
How many times do I have to tell you?

535
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,690
What are you doing?

536
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:23,490
Father, Father!

537
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,400
Man Geum!

538
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,920
Father! Father!

539
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,260
How could this happen? What happened?

540
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,030
Orabeoni!

541
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,460
Gae Ttong, from now on, listen to me carefully.

542
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,290
Listen to what?! Get in!

543
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,690
First, get in the boat! Hurry!

544
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,010
- Hurry! 
- You bastard!

545
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,660
This is the last time, so listen to me carefully.

546
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,400
No, this isn't the last time! You aren't going to die. I said you're not going to die!

547
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,990
If you don't want to end up like me, don't gamble,

548
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:05,050
and move away to some faraway countryside,

549
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,020
and don't even think about taking revenge, and just...

550
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,090
and just live your life, okay? Now just go.

551
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,430
-Got it?
- NO! I'm going to live with you!

552
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,360
Until I die, I will live with you!

553
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,000
Get in! GET IN!

554
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,710
- Get those bastards! 
 - Orabeoni!

555
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,670
Stop right there!

556
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,310
 Elder... 

557
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,860
 Man Geum! 

558
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,850
Stop right there! Right there!

559
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,410
Stop! Catch them!

560
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,370
ELDER!

561
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,980
GO!

562
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:09,470
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

563
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:15,790
 Gae Ttong... I mean Dae Gil... 

564
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,700
 You are my son. 

565
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,000
  No matter what anyone says, you are my son. 

566
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,790
 You are Baek Man Geum's son, Dae Gil... 

567
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,340
♫  Longing for you even if the tears well up  ♫

568
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:39,920
♫  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  ♫

569
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,180

00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,200
♫  Because I cannot live  ♫

571

 Jackpot 
♫  a time without you  ♫

572
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,850
 Why did it have to be his father?! 

573
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:57,030
 There is nothing else to make someone stronger than hatred does. 

574
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,930
  Don't look for me. 

575
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:01,070
  You little bastard! At least you need to be alive. 

576
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,780
  Where's the bastard who killed my father? 

577
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,950
 Are you just itching to die?! 

578
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,990
 Last night, I heard that our Prince Yeoning brought in a man who was half-dead. 

579
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,450
 What is the identity of this maiden? 

580
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,750
 Don't misunderstand this. You are not my style. 

581
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,270
 Just stop at this point. 

582
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:14,960
  I am saying you should just live a normal life. 

583
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,820
  I will give you a chance.  Now shoot. 

584
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,270
 Shut up! I don't need your petty advice!
