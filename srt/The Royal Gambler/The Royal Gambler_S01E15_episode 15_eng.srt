00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,690
 Episode 15 

2
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,500
 Baek Dae Gil are you truly my brother? 

3
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,110
 Oh, right. 

4
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,310
 I remembered. 

5
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,700
  I don't know why in the world you are curious about it, 

6
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,900
 but my birthday is Year Gyeyu (1693), Month 10, Day 6. 

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,800
 So Royal Mother already knew? 

8
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,790
Royal Mother.

9
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,430
Prince Yeoning.

10
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,560
Are you all right?

11
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,100
For about a month, my chest has been congested and my breathing stifled.

12
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,770
What brings you here?

13
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,410
Please speak.

14
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,720
Royal Mother, the one that passed away before I was born.

15
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,560
The six-month-premature older brother.

16
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,400
What about that child?

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,020
By chance,

18
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,850
is that six-month-premature older brother alive?

19
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,910
What brings you to that thought?

20
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,110
Is it Baek Dae Gil?

21
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,240
Royal Mother.

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,670
I have asked you,

23
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,910
is Baek Dae Gil the six-month-premature older brother who was said to be dead?

24
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,580
My liege lord told me to send this to you.

25
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,210
Do you know the meaning of this painting?

26
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,860
This is a dragon fish that seems to signify the king.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,220
But there are two fish in one pond.

28
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,450
It seems to signify a revolt.

29
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,640
This painting

30
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,040
I will hand to the master personally.

31
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,620
 Jeonggamnok (Records of Jeonggam - Book of Prophecy)  

32
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,760
Jeong-gam-nok.

33
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,740
What book is this?

34
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,010
It's a book of prophecy for the future of this nation of Joseon.
 Lee In Jwa 

35
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,750
A banned book among banned books that is to be burned upon discovery.

36
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,750
What exactly is
 Hwang In Gi 

37
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,920
in there that...

38
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,010
Nothing much.

39
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,940
The Yi  (Lee)  clan will annihilate Goryeo

40
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,450
and establish the nation of Joseon.
 (also known as Yi dynasty) 

41
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,750
Furthermore, the Jeong clan will annihilate the Joseon established  by the Yi clan

42
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,560
and establish the Jeong dynasty.

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,760
The Jeong clan will annihilate the Yi dynasty?

44
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,930
Then,

45
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,430
who is Jeong?

46
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,680
Though I don't know the face,

47
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,060
it is clear he is remarkable.

48
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,790
In the past, some 200 temples across the eight provinces

49
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,620
and some 100 provincial governments, upon a summons by him, participated in a revolt

50
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,400
and invaded the capital.

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,590
 The end of the knife should always point outward. 

52
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,090
 I believe everyone here is well aware 
    (Lee Yeong Chang)  

53
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,670
 just what direction that knife should point.  

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,110
 The message is that the Hamgyeong Province sector will soon arrive as well. 

55
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,490
 Good. 

56
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,260
 That's enough, Oppa. 

57
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,900
 The cutting edge will soon be gone. 

58
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,960
 In order to pluck the king's head, it needs to be like this.  
 (Dog Blade) 

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,320
 What are you talking about? 

60
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,480
 The king's head is mine. 

61
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,180
 So don't touch it. 

62
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,010
 Soon Im.  

63
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,010
 Take it easy. 

64
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,410
 Take what easy?  

65
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,900
 Is this the place? 

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,300
 The Southern Approaches Command and the Royal Guards Command 

67
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,490
 have sent their message that they will participate in the Great Cause. 

68
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,070
 If your side will strike the king's head first, 

69
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,040
 we will take care of the rest. 

70
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,080
 Tonight at Jashi (11 pm to 1 am), our Royal Military Guard 

71
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,220
 will leave Sukjeong Gate and Yoonbok Palace open. 

72
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,790
 Remember that you only have one chance. 

73
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,480
 The Southern Approaches Command and the Royal Guards Command, 

74
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,330
 as well the Royal Military Guard closest to the king, revolt. 

75
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,260
That it's so remarkable is unspeakable.

76
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,380
However, the more important point is that the commoners believe

77
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,560
in the protagonist of this Jeonggamnok.

78
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,790
I repeat, the one to annihilate the Yi clan,

79
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,710
the one deemed to establish a Jeong Joseon.

80
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,480
So to the current king whose power was diluted,

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,680
more scary than a revolt by a thousand,

82
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,190
 (Jeongamnok) 

83
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,210
is this book of prophecy.

84
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,240
Please tell me.

85
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,490
Royal Mother.

86
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,070
It is true.

87
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,930
When this mother entered the palace,

88
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,430
the child I bore after six months here,

89
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,640
As soon as he saw the light of the world,

90
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,540
the child that left his mother's side.

91
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,340
Baek Dae Gil.

92
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,520
That...

93
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,810
pitiful child.

94
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,650
He is your older brother, Prince.

95
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,580
How?

96
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,560
How have you kept

97
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,450
this hidden all this time?

98
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,650
If I don't hide it,

99
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,590
what other methods do I have?

100
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,140
Everyone,

101
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,420
everyone wanted that child dead.

102
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,840
The Queen from the house of Jang without a doubt, and the high ministers of the royal court.

103
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,670
Even His Majesty the King.

104
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,950
 Your Majesty, a six-month-premature baby? 

105
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,930
 It is unfathomable. 

106
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,010
 And how can a six-month-premature baby be so healthy?  

107
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,000
 You... 

108
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,050
 Have you ever suffered a loss from death? 

109
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,230
 Even a seven-month-premature baby rarely makes it to a year. 

110
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,520
 To be born premature at six months. 

111
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,740
 Imagine the predicament. 

112
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,400
That child.

113
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,350
If he had remained in the royal palace,

114
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,650
if he had lived,

115
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,860
I wouldn't be here now, to be sure, and Prince Yeoning,

116
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,190
you wouldn't be where you are now either.

117
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,100
As soon as he was born, he lost his mother,

118
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,400
and he lost his father.

119
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,540
He is even locked in jail at Lee In Jwa's cajolement.

120
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,400
Is there another child more pitiful than that child?

121
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,420
Baek Dae Gil isn't in jail at this moment.

122
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,450
He's not in jail?

123
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,500
He was released?

124
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,860
 Two swordsmen 10 footsteps away. 

125
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,380
 Two behind my back. 

126
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,280
 Two archers. 

127
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,000
You'll need to show me the way to Dog Blade.

128
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,520
His Majesty has given that child an opportunity?

129
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,330
He has ordered him to capture the man called Dog Blade?

130
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,870
Yes.

131
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
There's no way.

132
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,150
Don't you know?

133
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,820
His Majesty is not one to grant his favor without a reason.

134
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Though the reason isn't clear, by pushing that child to the brink of death, he is pursuing a different ulterior motive.

135
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,240
This won't do.  I must go see His Majesty immediately...

136
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,980
Royal Mother.

137
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:54,520
I will find out about it.  You stay here, and don't worry yourself about it, Royal Mother.

138
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,860
A reason?

139
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,100
Yes.  In politics, in order to gain one thing, you must give up one thing.

140
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,550
Also, isn't that your firm belief, Father?

141
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,940
 King Sookjong 

142
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:20,400
However, by releasing Baek Dae Gil and capturing the gambler Dog Blade,

143
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,570
you do not gain anything, Father.

144
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,310
So then, what is it that you're curious about?

145
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,290
Are you curious about what I hope to obtain?

146
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,550
Or are you curious about why I released Baek Dae Gil?

147
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,470
I...

148
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,220
am curious about all of those things.

149
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,380
If you are curious about my private thoughts,

150
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,630
then you should first reveal your private thoughts.

151
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,020
You... What, and how much do you know

152
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,390
about that fellow, Baek Dae Gil?

153
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,950
That man, Baek Dae Gil,

154
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,790
 Is the son of the gambler Baek Man Geum. 

155
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,960
 He is also a disciple of Joseon's best swordsman, Kim Che Geon. 

156
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,170
 Also, he is my friend. 

157
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,700
 He is my... 

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,740
You're wrong.

159
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,680
That fellow is not your friend.

160
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,020
He is a hunting dog.

161
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,640
He's just a hunting dog that captures prey for you.

162
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,290
To-sa-goo-peng. 
( Once the rabbits are dead, the hound is boiled too ).

163
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,960
They are used when they are needed for the hunt. When they are not needed... they are simply eaten.

164
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,380
How can a hunting dog be your friend?

165
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,340
Fine, since you're curious about my private thoughts,

166
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,710
This book is the original copy of a book that I banned, "Records of Jeonggam."

167
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,750
"A person with the surname of Yi ( allusion to Yi Seong Gye, the first King of Joseon ) brings about the destruction of Goryeo and founds Joseon."

168
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,890
"A person with the surname of Jeong brings destruction to that Joseon, and establishes a new dynasty."

169
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,330
Because of this damned book of prophecy, every time the owner of the throne changed, acts of treason resulted.

170
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,510
As a result hundreds, even thousands of lives were sacrificed.

171
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,670
For me too... When you were young,

172
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,900
there was a coup to drag me off the throne and place a certain Jeong as King.

173
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,170
What do you mean, a treasonous plot?

174
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,880
I... have never heard this until just now...

175
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,200
It means that 1000 soldiers from all over the eight provinces of Joseon jumped over the palace gates.

176
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,880
I alone remember it all.

177
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,720
That person's face.

178
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,970
That night, the ones who put a knife under my chin.  I'm talking about those bastard's faces.

179
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,800
 Lee Yeong Chang
Jang Gil San 

180
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,990
 Father! 

181
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,780
  Soon Im? 

182
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,190
 Oppa, at least you need to live. 

183
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,830
 Go!  What are you doing? I said go! 

184
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,910
  Our Soon Im... 

185
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,490
 What are you doing?  Go! 

186
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:28,200
 The Current Crown. Don't think you've won. 

187
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,920
 The Yi Dynasty will come to an end. 

188
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:44,490
 The Jeong clan will lead the new dynasty! 

189
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,200
 Records of Jeonggam 

190
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:17,630
That day. If it weren't for commissioned officer Kim Che Geon, your father would've died and would not be sitting here today.

191
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,800
But Father,

192
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:28,230
what is the connection between the treasonous plot on that day and the gambler Dog Blade?

193
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:38,310
With that kind of thinking, how are you going to catch Lee In Jwa? Huh?

194
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,590
Did that rat-like fellow look that easy to you?

195
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,250
How do you know who is behind Lee In Jwa?

196
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,980
This book probably would have ended up in card-gambler Dog Blade's gambling house.

197
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,400
That fellow Dog Blade is among the traitors who survived that day.

198
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,280
Are you saying that the gambler Dog Blade is a traitor?

199
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,240
Didn't you say you were curious about my private thoughts?

200
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,970
With much time and great restraint, I finally found

201
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,860
the root behind the two traitors Lee In Jwa and Dog Blade.

202
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,320
My goal is to pull out that root.

203
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:57,310
What do you do this?  You agreed that I'd only stay until the Ace of Sixes was dead.

204
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,890
I changed my mind.

205
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:04,490
What about me? Does my opinion not matter?

206
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,710
Tonight, he will come here.

207
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,510
He?

208
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:20,410
Dae Gil, you mean? Boss, you're not doing this on my account, are you?

209
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:26,690
I'll show you exactly how the Baek Dae Gil you cannot live without

210
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,030
gets trampled.

211
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,650
It's been a while.

212
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,290
They've released Baek Dae Gil. He may soon come—

213
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,970
I know already.

214
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,910
Please don't kill him.

215
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:18,210
You must not kill him.  Baek Dae Gil must die by my hand.

216
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,330
I will catch him.  You stay out of this.

217
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,450
 Read the record for that day.  The answer lies there. 

218
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,610
What's the matter, Your Highness?

219
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,430
The treason that occurred on the third month of of the year of Jeongchuk.  (1697, the 23rd year of Sookjong's reign) 

220
00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:00,770
Go find the books that have that treason recorded.  All of them, excluding nothing.

221
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,170
 (Jeonggamnok, Records of Jeonggam) 

222
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,930
My Liege.

223
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,670
I've delivered the letter to Mother Hwanggu.

224
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:18,150
Not long ago, the current king learned Dog Blade's identity.

225
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:23,670
So he will not let Dog Blade be.  He will pretend to overflow with sincerity.

226
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,930
He will use Baek Dae Gil to strike Dog Blade.

227
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,970
Well, what is your goal?

228
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,210
My goal?

229
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,810
 Baek Dae Gil, if you can't capture the true culprit,  

230
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,930
 you will be beheaded at sunrise tomorrow. 

231
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:54,570
 First, to turn the king's arrow headed toward me in Dog Blade's direction. 

232
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,770
  The second is to get into my possession, for leverage,  the roster which Dog Blade holds 

233
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:05,070
  of court ministers who hired an assassin and got seized by the scruffs of their necks.  

234
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,970
And third, the person  indicated by this book of  prophecy.

235
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:17,030
The man who will annihilate the Yi Joseon to establish the Jeong dynasty.

236
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,490
My true goal is to find him.

237
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:27,190
Dog Blade is the only one who knows his identity.

238
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,830
Then that man named Jeong will become king?

239
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,070
Actually, I don't believe in this book.

240
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,310
Then...

241
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:46,650
In the end, the one who will sit on the royal throne is not me nor the man of Jeong.

242
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,650
But Baek Dae Gil.  It will be him.

243
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,190
I want to go in quietly.

244
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,770
  Joseon of House of Yi... 

245
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:37,510
 Annihilate the Yi dynasty and establish the Jeong dynasty. 

246
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,510
Your Majesty.  What brings you here at this hour?

247
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:53,190
Do you remember the treason that occurred in the third month of Jeongchuk (1697)?

248
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,750
 Kim Chang Jip (Prime Minister) 

249
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,450
That is an incident that His Majesty ordered not to be discussed.

250
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,310
Hence, I have come to you, haven't I?

251
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,210
Have you read Jeonggamnok (Records of Jeonggam)?

252
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,750
Born as a snake but fated to be a dragon.

253
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,530
A man from the house of Jeong born in the year of the Yin Earth Snake on the month of the Yang Earth Dragon on the day of the Yin Earth Snake at the hour of Yang Earth Dragon.

254
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:36,370
The Ming nation's King Xuanzong was born under the same pillars and became an emperor.

255
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:41,250
Jeong also wants to crumble the Yi Joseon

256
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,730
and establish himself as the new king.

257
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:53,850
Then... That man named Jeong.  Who is he?

258
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,510
He is a man whose identity cannot be known.

259
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:04,610
Just that there is one man who survived the treason that day.

260
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,750
He was an underling of the treason's mastermind.

261
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:17,230
His name was... Kim Jeong Yeol, was it?

262
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,630
Kim Jeong Yeol?

263
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,090
You came quickly.

264
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,110
Such a grand welcome would make me uncomfortable though.

265
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:59,330
How nice for you to have so many mourners at your wake.

266
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,530
We need to wait it out to see just whose mourners they are.

267
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,050
Swinder Golsa.  Why did you kill him?

268
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,650
Why do you ask me that?

269
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,110
Baek Dae Gil, I heard you killed him.

270
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,650
Where's Seol Im?

271
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,650
Enough.

272
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:35,150
If you ask and argue, must I answer all and give you all?

273
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,970
If you're curious, then beat me.

274
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,330
If you draw the ten tag, you win.

275
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,890
This gambling den is yours then.

276
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,710
It looks easier than I thought.

277
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:12,850
If you don't know the rule, then it's easy, of course. Just one rule.

278
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,250
By fair means or foul.

279
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,550
You, and you.

280
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,260
Well, should we make it more interesting?

281
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,960
Should we see if you can still do that in the dark?

282
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,360
You will probably come to regret it.

283
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,240
We'll find out then.

284
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,670
It's mine now, this gambling den.

285
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,760
It's still

286
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,090
a draw, I think.

287
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,430
 - Are you in there? 
 - Who is it? 

288
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,090
- Are you Kim Jeong Yeol? 
 - Yes, so?

289
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,790
- You know the traitor named Jeong, right?  
 - Never mind.

290
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,150
I plan to capture that man.

291
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,000
How will you vouch for my life?

292
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,220
For that man,

293
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,150
my neck was broken!

294
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,960
Help me.

295
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,910
You know his face.

296
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,120
You're the only one.

297
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,610
That's enough.

298
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,190
I think we've given them enough of a show.

299
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,240
- You're so confident?  
  - Would I have come here without confidence?

300
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,020
Then play a proper game.

301
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,210
The two of you, man to man.

302
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,950
Wagering your pride as men.

303
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,970
And according to the rule of this gambling den,

304
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,110
the one who draws the ten tag is the winner.

305
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,390
Which one among these is the ten tag?

306
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,850
You two gambling masters will have to make that judgment.

307
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,210
 Is the right one the ten?  

308
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,190
I think this side is the ten tag.

309
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,140
Why? It's not?

310
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:35,170
But I think it's a bit unfair.

311
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,130
The two of you might be concocting a swindle together.

312
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,120
If it's a swindle, you can strike my neck.

313
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,870
Also, it hurts my pride a bit too.

314
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,000
You have one arm.

315
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,800
Tie me.

316
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:12,390
It hurts my pride to go against a one-armed man

317
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,680
You're Kim Che Geon's disciple, I hear.

318
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,160
You know my master?

319
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,220
It's interesting, right?

320
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,070
Who would win.

321
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,040
However...

322
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,180
Why did you become the likes of an assassin?

323
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,680
Hey, why are you curious about so many things at the gambling table?

324
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,220
Just worry about winning.

325
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,190
Stop now.

326
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,500
What are you doing?

327
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,560
Boss.  Dae Gil.

328
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,390
It's a man's victory and my father's revenge is wagered on it too.

329
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,080
Stop that.  Stop!

330
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,190
What!

331
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,250
Baek Dae Gil.

332
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,370
I won.

333
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,890
By fair means or foul.

334
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,660
You don't know about a card until you turn it, right?

335
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,380
You won't acknowledge this?

336
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,720
But before that, in front of those gathered here,

337
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,010
let's make it clear.

338
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,490
If I win, this gambling den without a doubt,

339
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,110
and Seol Im as well, I will take them with me.

340
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,410
If you win, do that.

341
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,170
You. Do you trust that woman?

342
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,310
Turn it.

343
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,170
  One. 

344
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,600
The other one left is the ten, so I've won.

345
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,790
Why did you kill my father?

346
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,270
So you knew?

347
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,100
I just found out.

348
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,030
I found out after your confession, Dog Blade.

349
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,610
What do you think this card is?

350
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,560
 One. 

351
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:47,150
Rather than a victory, the original goal of this match was for you to confess.

352
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,410
So you two colluded from the start.

353
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,830
This wasn't part of my plan though.

354
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,140
Why did you kill him? Why did you kill my father!

355
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,120
A gambler dies and what reason is needed?

356
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,250
And in this situation the reason isn't what matters. You know that.

357
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,560
The game is not over yet either.

358
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,510
Then we will see it to a true victory like men.

359
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,380
Dae Gil, stop now.

360
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,880
Don't worry.

361
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,530
Starting now, it's real.

362
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,730
I'll have you feel it.  The distance between you and me.

363
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,700
Acknowledge it now.

364
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,080
Who was it?

365
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,810
The one who paid you to kill Swindler Golsa.

366
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,170
Was it the White-Faced Scholar, Lee In Jwa?

367
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,740
Lee In Jwa

368
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,640
commissioned me.

369
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,910
However, that wasn't the only reason I killed him.

370
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,460
Killing Swindler Golsa

371
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:49,610
was solely by my will.

372
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,960
I thought it was a brief escape.

373
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,730
But I've come too far.

374
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,910
You be responsible.

375
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:52,930
The one wearing a hat should be better than the one with a blade in hand.

376
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,200
I've lost.

377
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,600
Not yet.

378
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,390
Why did you come?

379
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,910
I came out of worry for you.

380
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,010
Also,

381
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,830
who was it?

382
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,540
The man of treason with the name of Jeong hiding behind you.

383
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,220
How did you...

384
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,270
The one who sent Baek Dae Gil to this match today was His Majesty.

385
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,930
So the intention was to capture me and expose my backer?

386
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,570
Did you think I would tell you?

387
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,850
So I brought with me a special guest today.

388
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,600
So you're still alive.

389
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:37,100
Take a good look.  Among the high-ranking men here, is one the traitor named Jeong?

390
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:56,270
Your Highness, it appears none is him.

391
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,320
Have another close look.  He must be present.

392
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:21,120
Actually, my memory is a little murky.

393
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,810
And I really don't think he's here.

394
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,610
I understand.

395
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,100
You may go now.

396
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,870
I'm sorry.

397
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:47,130
This man will be handled by state law.  Arrest him.

398
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,000
Yes, Your Highness.

399
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,050
I have a request.

400
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:56,600
This is my last time in the gambling den.  Let me have a drink of wine.

401
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,840
Boss.

402
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,200
What is this deed!

403
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,080
For a brief while,

404
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:14,080
because of your presence, Seol Im, I was happy.

405
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,660
Thank you.

406
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,430
I've completely

407
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,130
lost.

408
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,570
Boss. Boss.

409
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,920
Was it you?

410
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:52,470
The one who is to annihilate Yi Joseon to establish the Jeong dynasty?

411
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,370
Lee In Jwa.

412
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,880
I believe meeting like this is good for neither of us.

413
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:25,300
If the two of us meet, the current king will draw his sword.

414
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,350
If you feared the king's sword, you wouldn't have come here.

415
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,130
How about it? Join hands with me.

416
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,370
My power that can flip Joseon over and then more.

417
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,410
Will you be able to handle it?

418
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,390
Do you really think I, Lee In Jwa...

419
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:50,500
won't even be able to handle that?

420
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:55,380
You never know. We also don't know who will betray the other.

421
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,420
It seems you lack trust in people.

422
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,770
Since you haven't even told me your real name.

423
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,370
My name is Jeong Hee Ryang

424
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,830
Jeong Hee Ryang?

425
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,830
There is a leader in Yeongnam named Jeong Hee Ryang... You're telling me you're him?

426
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:17,000
How can I compare to someone like you,

427
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,880
who causes uproars in the capital?

428
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:28,700
So what do you think? With my military prowess,

429
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,400
combined with your power from Yeongnam, we'll most definitely take the King's life

430
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,840
and still have enough left to take over the government.

431
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,060
So from the Current Crown's eyes...

432
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,690
are you planning on making them shed tears of blood?

433
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,480
The liquor made with the azaleas atop Mount Mokmyeon

434
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,300
is indeed like none other.

435
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,950
I will invite you over sometime.

436
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,950
You've always followed me into the gambling houses,

437
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,520
so why are you outside today?

438
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,980
What you see isn't always everything.

439
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,480
So what happened to Dog Blade?

440
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,910
He committed suicide.

441
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,740
It's a suitable ending for an assassin.

442
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,560
Now... only your neck is left.

443
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,890
No,

444
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,850
rather than slashing my neck,

445
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,120
there is a more important matter.

446
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,630
Now, the time has come for you to know.

447
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,290
Ah, right on time, Your Highness Prince Yeoning.

448
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,590
Lee In Jwa.

449
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:35,710
have you also come to seek out the traitor named Jeong?

450
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,660
No, Your Highness. I was  here to tell Baek Dae Gil, who is standing in front of me,

451
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:44,080
an amusing story.

452
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,150
It looks good that you two elites have become friends.

453
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:57,090
On the other hand, it is regretful.

454
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,420
I see that Prince Yeoning already knew

455
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,680
what kind of relationship you two have.

456
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,990
Is that true?

457
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,720
What is?

458
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,260
Are you asking because you really don't know?

459
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,650
The fact that Your Highness and I

460
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,820
are brothers. He said we're brothers.

461
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,510
You there.

462
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,930
Now I am finally able to meet you,

463
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,270
Dam Seo.

464
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,610
Why isn't it Baek Dae Gil?

465
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:14,380
Your life started with an act of deception by the Current Crown.

466
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,310
Though everyone knows it,

467
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:26,490
it's an event that no one can speak of.

468
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,620
It's written from before you were born,

469
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,620
the meeting between the Current Crown and Royal Noble Consort Sook.

470
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,350
Would you be able to handle the weight of the truth?

471
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:41,180
Handle or not, I'll be the one to do it. Continue what you were saying.

472
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,580
Royal Noble Consort Sook's husband during her time as a water maid...

473
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,610
is your father Baek Man Geum.

474
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,720
During the time your mother was a water maid,

475
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,090
she somehow caught the Current Crown's eye.

476
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,800
 My wife! I will wager her! 

477
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,620
  Your father, Baek Man Geum, who fell prey to the Current Crown's deception, 

478
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,830
 bet Royal Noble Consort Sook, 

479
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:18,320
 in the end having his wife taken from him by the Current Crown. 

480
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,420
 He later found out it was the Current Crown's deception, so he argued with him. 

481
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,110
  Royal Noble Consort Sook coldlly threw your father out. 

482
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:36,790
 But you were born as a six-month premature baby,  

483
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:42,300
 and were abandoned by your own mother. 

484
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:50,970
Conclusively, since both children were born of the same womb, Prince Yeoning and you are brothers.

485
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,350
Royal Noble Consort Sook,

486
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:59,950
that lady is my mother?

487
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:06,760
Did you think that I would believe that?

488
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:13,260
True, it's not something that can be easily accepted.

489
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:19,500
But think through it hard.  Surely there is suspicion.

491
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,010
 Just a little. 

492
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,240
 Bear just a little more and wait. 

493
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:44,460
So? Why are you telling me that?

494
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,220
What is changed from Her Royal Consort Sook being my mother?

495
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,890
You still don't know?

496
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,240
Baek Dae Gil, you are

497
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,110
not Baek Man Geum's child.

498
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,430
What in the world!

499
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,530
The current king.

500
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,580
Your father is not Baek Man Geum.

501
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,890
It's the current king.

502
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,200
This nation's monarch.

503
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,420
Did you say the monarch

504
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,390
is my father?

505
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,560
Father?

506
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:35,350
 ♬ It's alright, dearest, I'm okay to ache. ♬ 

507
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:42,970
♬   Regard me as a bad guest going through hardship     ♬

508
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:49,640
♬   I cry a thousand times and smile only  once   ♬

509
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,050
 M-Mother. 

510
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,830
 I'm sorry.  I should have sought you out sooner. 

511
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,810
 You two go capture that Lee In Jwa. 

512
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,610
 It's time now. 

513
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:02,310
 Lee In Jwa is hopeless now. 

514
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,380
 Lee In Jwa, your crime of plotting treason. 

515
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,240
 At midday in two days, have this man killed by dismemberment. 

516
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,840
 It's the end for you. 

517
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,380
 I will watch with a smile as you suffer the plight of having your head go flying. 

518
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,350
 Your father, Baek Man Geum, is alive. 

519
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,190
 Don't lie. 

520
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:21,110
 Rescue me, and I will let you meet him.
