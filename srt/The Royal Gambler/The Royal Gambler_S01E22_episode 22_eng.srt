2
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,930
The bastard has not escaped this forest yet.

3
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,560
- Find him. 
 - Yes, Sir!

4
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,450
He's had more than enough time to escape.

5
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,670
No, I'm sure he's here somewhere.

6
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,630
Your Majesty!

7
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,100
Your Majesty!

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,920
 Your Majesty! Please come back! 

9
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,960
 Geum, 

10
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,070
 Gyeongjong, 20th King of Joseon 

11
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,860
 I'm sorry. 

12
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,200
 This younger brother of yours will seek forgiveness from you, 

13
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
 Your Majesty. 

14
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,330
 Your Majesty! 

15
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,260
 Come back, Your Majesty! 

16
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,410
Your Majesty!

17
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,870
Come back, Your Majesty!

18
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,310
Your Majesty.

19
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,290
Your Majesty.

20
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,250
 Queen Seonui, King Gyeongjong's second queen 

21
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,740
Your Majesty.

22
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,960
Sir!

23
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
What is the matter?

24
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,960
His Majesty passed away.

25
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,190
Let's go back now.

26
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,890
Yi In Jwa!

27
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,840
Live hiding like that forever, like a rat,

28
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,750
without  showing up your ugly face.

29
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,710
 I don't have much time to live. 

30
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,170
 Will anything be different? 

31
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,930
 Will all of those who died pointlessly come back to life?! 

32
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,080
 The Crown Prince... It can't be. 

33
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,810
Let go of this hand this instant!

34
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,300
Your Lordship.
 (sackcloth: traditional Korean mourning attire) 

35
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,110
I've just come from seeing the royal physician.

36
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,590
They say the king fell unconscious after eating the crab marinated in soy sauce you set out for him.
 (Choi Yi Seok, Kim Il Gyeong, Jo Il Soo) 

37
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,990
What do you really want to say to me?

38
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,450
How could you serve crab marinated in soy sauce and sweet persimmon to His Majesty, who has been sick for a long time and even coughing up blood?

39
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,030
Those foods are contraindicated with his condition so they would be poisonous. Didn't you know that?

40
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,980
My heart is also aching  that His Majesty passed away.

41
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,580
But I have never heard, until now, that people pass away from eating those foods. Am I right?

42
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,550
But—

43
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,960
But why are you now casting aspersions on the Crown Prince just for setting out the meal for him?

44
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,860
Don't I look like a Crown Prince to you?

45
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,100
You should go back now.

46
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,320
Crown Prince, what happened?

47
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,200
As you heard, with the crab marinated in soy sauce and the sweet persimmon that His Majesty used to like,

48
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,280
I merely delivered him my heart.

49
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,020
Please tell me honestly, did you—

50
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,300
Do you think

51
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,620
I poisoned the King?

52
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,650
Can you say that you did not?

53
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,730
If it is not true, say that you did not poison him.

54
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,380
"I'm innocent and I'm not ashamed of myself as the Crown Prince."

55
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,460
To this Baek Dae Gil, your friend whom  you said you could throw your life away for,

56
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,100
please say, "I am innocent."

57
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,970
If I say it's not me,

58
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,560
can you believe me?

59
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,890
One time, I considered you as a friend.

60
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,980
 Do you think it makes sense to have a friend of my status? 

61
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,380
 If you want, shall I become your friend? 

62
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,380
 I don't need a friend like you. 

63
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,080
 At one time, I regarded you as a younger brother. 

64
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,120
 Are there such younger siblings who raise a sword against their older brothers? 

65
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,500
 Are there such older brothers who block their younger siblings' road ahead? 

66
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,330
I believe you.

67
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,380
However, in your mind...

68
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,650
the moment you had that doubt in your mind, you'd already thrown me out.

69
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,290
- Your Highness. 
 - I'm not  Your Highness, 

70
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,750
but  Your Majesty. 

71
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,350
Never, again.

72
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,700
Never again will I be looked down upon by hearing I'm a lowborn blood from a water maid.

73
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,180
The people who stand against, look down on,  and humiliate this Yi Geum,

74
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,200
I won't forgive anymore.

75
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,690
Even if they are my parents or my siblings.

76
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,550
I don't have anything to talk with you about any more, so please leave.

77
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,920
Your Highness.

78
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,600
What His Highness said was not wrong.

79
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,900
From this point, it's not your place to interfere.

80
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
From now on,

81
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,090
he is not your friend.

82
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,240
Dae Gil. Are you really leaving?

83
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,700
You can't stop him. How stubborn he is, since he takes after his father.

84
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,950
He has already left the house more than 100 times.

85
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,710
Elder!

86
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,740
Who is it?

87
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,550
No way! Who is this? Man Geum!

88
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,020
Have you been well?

89
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,120
Man Geum! Hey, you punk!

90
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,410
What a hard time we had after you died!

91
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,850
You'd have done better to have remained a corpse. Why did you come out into this rotten world?

92
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,370
Did you think I'd dance around because I'm happy when I see you?

93
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,220
Thank you

94
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,160
for protecting my Dae Gil well.

95
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,340
Man Geum. Man Geum. Aigoo! Am I  dreaming or awake?

96
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,880
Aigoo, Man Geum.

97
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,920
Do you want all of us to leave together? Where?

98
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,850
To the place where we can help people and live well ourselves.

99
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,230
If you go, you'll know it, Elder.

100
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,620
Don't worry, it's a nice place.

101
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,730
Where is that nice place?

102
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,540
If that is what you have decided, you should go.

103
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,380
What about Yi In Jwa?  Were you unable to find him in the end?

104
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,450
No one knows his whereabouts.

105
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,100
Even if he sustains his life somewhere,

106
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,780
he can't rise again.

107
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,720
Ahh, really!  Why are the fly bugs here?

108
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,290
Hurry up and get lost!

109
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,450
Please deliver this to Boss.

110
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,170
My Lord.

111
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,990
You sustain your life.

112
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,740
Boss,

113
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,060
a beggar gave me this...

114
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,180
 Don't look for me, and wait. 

115
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,760
 One day, I will find you again. 

116
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,780
 Yeongjo
 Joseon's 21st King 

117
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,890
Although there is no way to express our sorrow over the former king's passing,

118
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,330
the position of taking care of the nation's people, the throne, cannot be left vacant for long.

119
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,240
For this Joseon nation's vitality and to continue proper administration,

120
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,500
Crown Prince Yi Geum will be the newly appointed King.

121
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,750
Hurrah!

122
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,180
Thousand years!

123
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,910
Hurrah again!

124
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,840
Thousands of thousands of years!

125
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,210
 Thousands of years! 

126
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,450
 Thousands of years! 

127
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,050
 Thousands of thousands of years 

128
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,340
 Thousands of years! 

129
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,680
 Do you resent me? 

130
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,040
 I don't resent you.  We each have our destinies. 

131
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,190
 We are just following our own paths. 

132
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,840
 Thousands of thousands of years! 

133
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,120
 Thousands of years! 

134
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,260
 Thousands of years! 

135
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,080
 Thousands of thousands of years! 

136
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,070
 Thousands of years! 

137
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,540
 Wait.  I will rise again. 

138
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,620
 I'll chew your internal organs 

139
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,520
  and plow over the rotten royal court. 

140
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,390
No. It can't be.

141
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,330
Over there.

142
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,950
Are you really leaving?

143
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,220
Take care of yourself.

144
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,470
You too, Master.

145
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,580
Your Majesty.  Heaven's blessings upon you.

146
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,710
Royal Secretary.

147
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

148
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,710
I don't want to see your face any longer.

149
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,660
Then shall I leave the palace?
 (Royal Secretary Kim Il Gyeong) 

150
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,770
No.

151
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,080
I will order a beheading.

152
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,860
Your Majesty.

153
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,840
Your Majesty. You carry the joke too far.

154
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,600
Joke?

155
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,870
Right after the late King acceded to the throne,

156
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,240
one hundred Noron ministers who assisted me lost their lives

157
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,220
and more than 300 ministers were sent into exile.

158
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,360
Did you think that I wouldn't know who was behind it?

159
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Behead the Royal Secretary Kim Il Gyeong!

160
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,220
Your Majesty.

161
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,540
East Officer of Central Council Mok Ho Ryong.

162
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,000
Since you accused others of false treason,

163
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,110
innocent people lost their lives.

164
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,150
Your Majesty.  Please spare me, Your Majesty! 
  (East Officer of Central Council Mok Ho Ryong)  

165
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,790
Carry out the executions.

166
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,880
Yes!

167
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,380
Your Majesty.  Spare me!

168
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,410
- Your Majesty! 
   - Your Majesty! 

169
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,130
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

170
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,110
Those who have objections tell me now. However,

171
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,530
you have to put up your lifeline as security.

172
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,420
Where did he go?

173
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,670
I don't know where.

174
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,950
He didn't...

175
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,230
leave any last words?

176
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,110
I understand.

177
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,230
Please leave now.

178
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

179
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,770
 I can bear the weight of this royal throne. 

180
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:16,370
 However, the position of being left alone in the world... 

181
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,580
 is hard to bear. 

182
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,890
Wow. Who is here?

183
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,420
Hello. Welcome back.

184
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,030
Wow, what is all this?

185
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,140
Ah, really. It seems we came to our hometown.

186
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,610
 Wanted  
 Hwang Jin Gi 

187
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,520
  Wanted  
 Yi In Jwa  

188
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,840
Dae Gil!  Dae Gil!  Eat some watermelon first!

189
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,790
Okay.

190
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,330
Here, take a ripe piece.

191
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,930
Here.

192
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,110
Take this watermelon.

193
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,160
Unni!  Oh my goodness!

194
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,620
Have you been well?

195
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,740
- Welcome. 
 - Thank you.

196
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,950
Thank you.

197
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,850
 Crown Prince Hyojang - King Yeongjo's first son 

198
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,300
If you only gain knowledge but do not think,  you'll be ruined.

199
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,160
If you think without knowledge, it is dangerous.

200
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,660
 Announcement: The Current Crown...The Former King... Of Royal Blood 

201
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,410
I mean, what is going on? Really.

202
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,680
 The King has poisoned the former King. 

203
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,140
 The Current Crown is not of a legitimate royal bloodline. 

204
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,290
 The King poisoned the former King. 

205
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,060
The King is not of a legitimate royal bloodline.

206
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,460
Find those who put up these malicious posters.

207
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,610
Behead them all.

208
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

209
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,950
 Hwang Jin Gi 

210
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,540
It's been awhile.

211
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,450
My Liege!

212
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,570
So how have you been doing?

213
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,530
Between this and that, I've been very busy.

214
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,650
Did Moo Myeong really die that day?

215
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,930
He's alive.

216
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,550
 Ousting of the false King and installation of a new one. 

217
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,750
 Ousting of the false King and installation of a new one. 

218
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,690
 I guess it is to catch me one day. 

219
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,570
Or intending to use him as bait.

220
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,710
The reason you've sought me out now is...?

221
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,870
I've already begun

222
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,190
the Great Cause we've been dreaming of.

223
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,410
The mind remains in the right state.

224
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,130
A learned person—

225
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,210
 You are to go to Park Pil Hyeon 

226
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,150
 Let him know the time has come.  
  (Park Pil Hyeon) 

227
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,150
How many years has it been, Yi In Jwa? 
  (Jeong Hee Ryang) 

228
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,310
Are the preparations ready?

229
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,980
I was about to be tired from hoeing day and night.

230
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,220
Though they are few in number, they have been instilled with courage.

231
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,990
When is it?

232
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,550
The great day?

233
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,750
It has already begun.

234
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,870
First

235
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,400
it is my hometown, Cheongju.

236
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,840
- Let's go! 
 - Yes, sir!

237
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,510
Cheongju Castle must not be taken by those traitors. Never!

238
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,390
Protect it with your lives.

239
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,410
Yi In Jwa!

240
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,330
 March 15, 1728, Cheongju Castle 

241
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,960
 As soon as I capture Cheongju, 

242
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,410
 you take Yeongnam region. 

243
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,120
 Then right after,  Deputy Leader Park Pil Hyeon 

244
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,220
 will capture Honam region. 

245
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,650
Our Leader has captured Cheongju Castle!

246
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,530
Yeah!  Yeah!

247
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,850
We will immediately

248
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,940
advance to Jeonju!

249
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,560
Yes, Sir!

250
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,360
The weather is nice.

251
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,450
Hello, Your Highness the Dowager Queen.

252
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,970
How is your walk?

253
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,390
How can you be so overflowing with refinement?

254
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,220
The Crown Prince is becoming stronger and stronger.

255
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,990
If the former King had had an heir like the Crown Prince,

256
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,950
it would have been nice.

257
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,360
Then we will be going now.

258
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,400
Haeng.

259
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,560
 Your Majesty! 

260
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,930
Yi In Jwa!

261
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,920
Summon Kim Che Geon.

262
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,490
 There's a rebellion.  A rebellion has broke, out in Cheongju, and all the castles 

263
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,900
have been taken. That's what people say.

264
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,330
Is it true? Who incited the revolt?

265
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,260
- You didn't know? 
 - Make way!

266
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,150
Make way!

267
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,930
Following Goryeong, even Geochang has fallen.

268
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,620
What are you going to do?

269
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,420
That bastard Yi In Jwa has nine lives.

270
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,810
Don't get any funny ideas.

271
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,990
That guy has nothing to do with us anymore.  Don't you remember?

272
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,720
You were going to forget all about it.

273
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,920
Things are so good right now.

274
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,070
But still, that's not right.

275
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,720
Even so, they say all the people of those areas have been captured.

276
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,440
After all, those who are bleeding are the people.

277
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,010
Father is correct.

278
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,180
Dae Gil.

279
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,050
We're not royal soldiers.  We shouldn't get involved.

280
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,610
Still, we don't know what'll happen...

281
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,350
We should get ready.

282
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,670
Aigoo, who is this?

283
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,250
Aigoo, it's Dae Gil's Master.

284
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,430
It's been a long time.  Just how many years has it been?

285
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,650
It's been a long time.

286
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,450
You came!

287
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,460
Yes, Seol Im.

288
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,640
Master.

289
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,380
Have you been well?

290
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,710
It's nice.

291
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,050
If it's about Yi In Jwa...

292
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,860
Dae Gil.

293
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,100
This isn't someone else's business.

294
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,340
Since the Cheongju Castle has been taken over,

295
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,060
under the pretext that the townspeople supported Yi In Jwa's revolt,

296
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,390
all of the townspeople have been massacred.

297
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:54,890
The officer in charge was removed from his position, but the blood of the people can't be restored.

298
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,400
That... was the King's order?

299
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,200
That was not what the King wanted.

300
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,210
However, it can't be undone.

301
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,190
Don't you want to end it too?

302
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,790
Your bad fate with that man, Yi In Jwa?

303
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,050
Yi In Jwa.

304
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,560
My Liege! Can you hear?

305
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:31,200
Yes. This is the mind of the people.

306
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:42,520
 Present King, just wait. 

307
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,890
 I will soon step on Hanyang territory. 
 (Hanyang: former name of Seoul) 

308
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,770
 Yi In Jwa's  spirit is high and threatening. 

309
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,330
 Each minute, each second is urgent. 

310
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:59,250
Now... the time has come to meet him.

311
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,590
Your Majesty. Former Cavalry Officer Baek Dae Gil is here.

312
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,990
You can all leave now.

313
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,880
Sit down.

315
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,530
Father, who is this person?

316
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,010
Haeng, you leave for a moment.

317
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,600
He clearly belongs to a different generation.

318
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,950
The Crown Prince's face looks identical to the King's.

319
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,270
Is that so?

320
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,630
I heard the people involved in the revolt have been cruelly massacred by the government solders.

321
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:20,830
Some have become insurgents, and some have joined forces with those insurgents.

322
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,800
And some are helping them from behind.

323
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,930
They are all insurgents, so they have just paid for their crimes.

324
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:34,260
How is it?  How is it that the people have come to follow an insurgent?

325
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,610
Don't you intend to examine the causes?

326
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,900
What the people want

327
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,750
is a small bit of land they can cultivate

328
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,720
and a small amount of food they can eat. That's all they want.

329
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,350
What the people want is merely those things, Your Majesty.

330
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,300
So...

331
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,650
Do you want me to sit still and watch those rebels expand their power?

332
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,980
Your Majesty.  Then what is the difference between you and the traitor Yi In Jwa?

333
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,040
You didn't come to receive the royal order, but to question me.

334
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,610
Please think of your people first, Your Majesty.

335
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,730
It's a small sacrifice for the greater good.

336
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:29,110
This throne is a position that requires me to endure the pain of killing my own people with my own hands.

337
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,370
I'll give you the position and the soldiers.

338
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:40,090
That man, Yi In Jwa... There's no one who knows him better than you do.

339
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,590
Aren't you able to clearly read that beast's mind?

340
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,120
I don't care what sacrifices need to be made.

341
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,710
Block him.

342
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,780
If a large army is put in motion, the citizens will be hurt.

343
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,160
Please rescind your order, Your Majesty.

344
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,150
I will give you five days.

345
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,190
If I don't hear anything in five days,

346
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,420
I'll move the central army.

347
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,120
Try to do it.

348
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:12,110
When it comes to your concern for the people, there's nothing you can't do.

349
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,170
What are you going to do?

350
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,730
They must be pressed by the urgency,

351
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:43,460
because in ten days  the rebels will enter the capital.

352
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,850
The situation in the streets must be the same.

353
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,530
I don't have much time.

354
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,720
They say at one point it was a small disturbance in a local town. 
  (Choi Yi Seok, Left State Minister) 

355
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,180
It has changed into a revolt by the locals and  the local castles have been taken over. Now, they've come in front of our noses.

356
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,420
Because now they've come in front of our noses,

357
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,360
shouldn't we immediately find some kind of countermeasure?

358
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,340
Even so, we can't move heedlessly.  
    (Jo Il Soo, Chief State Minister) 

359
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,240
There is no guarantee that Yi In Jwa will succeed.

360
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,620
We don't know when our necks will be slashed.

361
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,700
But, in this situation, His Majesty summons Baek Dae Gil...

362
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,480
I can't figure out His Majesty's intention.

363
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,680
He is probably planning to recapture Yi In Jwa by using Baek Dae Gil.

364
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,480
That will never happen.

365
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,120
It's a letter from Leader Yi In Jwa.

366
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,080
Is the content of this letter true?

367
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:18,340
Deliver this message to him, that we'll wager the fate of the Sorons' lives and deaths on the fellow Yi In Jwa.

368
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,450
Your Excellency!

369
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,150
However, if it's not true,

370
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:29,850
all of our Sorons... will stand against him.

371
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,280
Make sure to deliver it that way.

372
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,650
I'll deliver it that way.

373
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,980
Your Excellency, what in the world is the letter's content?

374
00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:02,730
First, support Prince Milpung, Yi Tan to the throne.

375
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:11,040
 I'll oust the false King and install a real one. 

376
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,020
 So, you are saying I'm a real king?  
 (Prince Milpung Yi Tan, great-grandson of Crown Prince Sohyeon.) 

377
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,970
 He is the Current Crown who acceded to the throne after poisoning the former King. 

378
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:25,820
 His bloodline from the water maid is also unclear. 

379
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,050
 How can we serve such a man as King? 

380
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,270
  Prince Milpung, you drag him down and ascend to the throne. 

381
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:44,190
  So you straighten up the royal clan lineage and bestow your grace upon the people. 

382
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,790
 Then show your power. 

383
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:53,520
 You don't even need to look far for it. 

384
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,950
Your Highness!

385
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,290
I came from Jeolla Province.

386
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,970
I came from Chongcheong Province.

387
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,640
I came from Gyeongsang Province.

388
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,620
Your Highness, those are not all of them yet.

389
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:28,760
The people who rose from the eight provinces are more than 200,000.

390
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,090
Two hundred thousand?

391
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,190
Really, do you mean 200,000 rising soldiers?

392
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,600
Yes. Your Majesty.

393
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,980
  Jeong from Yeongnam Region and Park Pil Hyeon from Honam Region head the list. 

394
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,410
 The local government soldiers join the revolutionary army. 

395
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,350
 Regardless of whether they are scholars, farmers, craftsmen, merchants, females, or males, they join us. 

396
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:19,190
Even though there is a large number, they're not trained well. Do you think they can defy the government army?

397
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:26,180
Moreover, if there are none of our side in the palace, it won't be easy to drag the Current Crown down.

398
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,280
If there is someone from our side in the palace...

399
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,530
The Sorons have no power at present.

400
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,700
There is someone above them.

401
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,570
If you say someone above them...

402
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,840
It is the Dowager Queen.

403
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:51,250
The Dowager Queen? So are you telling me Her Highness the Dowager Queen is really allied with Yi In Jwa?

404
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,150
Shh! Watch your mouth.

405
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:06,350
I'll meet the Dowager Queen personally and confirm it with  her.

406
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,270
So prepare your minds.

407
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,800
Since the royal lineage has changed, please correct it.

408
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,030
Was this letter really sent by the Dowager Queen?

409
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,290
No, it wasn't.

410
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,360
It was given to me personally by the Dowager Queen.

411
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,810
 I can't forget the day when the late King was poisoned. 

412
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:59,590
 Do you know the feeling of my blood flowing topsy-turvy when I see the Current Crown? 

413
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,600
 If you move the people's minds outside the palace, 

414
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,650
 I'll form the ministers' opinion. 

415
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,870
 If you turn over this rotten nation, 

416
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:21,590
 I'll definitely cut off the Current Crown's life. 

417
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:28,170
 Please accomplish the Great Cause. 

418
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,950
The moment Your Highness joins hands with me,

419
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:38,750
the Dowager Queen will draw the sword.

420
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,620
You have already seen enough.

421
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:49,810
With this kind of spirit, it takes only 10 days to get to the capital. So 10 days will be enough.

422
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:57,010
Your Highness. Please make your decision.

423
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,360
Yes. I'll accompany you for the Great Cause.

424
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,700
Those who have already escaped to the north are not few in number.

425
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:25,140
Master, I'll meet Boss Hong and go. So you go to the mountain den first and get ready.

426
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,390
Okay. By the way, you punk...

427
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:32,890
Who are you that you command the master?

428
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,470
Master. You'll do it anyhow. Why are you nagging?

429
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,720
Look at this hopeless punk!

430
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,260
What? You want me to get some medicine?

431
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:54,100
Yeah. Immediately. There is nothing you can't get in this capital.

432
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,940
You show up without any notice after a few years, and what are you talking totally groundlessly?

433
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:04,750
Look, Boss Hong. If you've filled your stomach by sucking the people's bloody pus the past years,

434
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,350
at least once, you can do something for them.

435
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,340
Even though it's only talk, you're talking disappointingly...  When did I suck the bloody pus...

436
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,560
It's not hard to get the medicine... What kind and how much should I get?

437
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,510
Are you all ready?

438
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:34,750
I prepared 30 horses and some food as well.

439
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,440
Boss Hong gave it to us. Seol Im, you take care of it well.

440
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,760
Here.

441
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,330
These are the cardinal points for the peddlers from the eight provinces.

442
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,450
Dae Gil, Oldman Southern Goblin, and Seol Im.

443
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,550
Here! Block Yi In Jwa's army from moving.  
   Anseong, Gyeonggi Province 

444
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,800
Then the rest of the three will cut off the supply line at Daejeon.

445
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,650
Then each group move to either Gyeongsang Province  or Jeolla Province

446
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,350
and win over the present government jurisdiction, and people who joined the rebels later, and bring them to our side.

447
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,150
Then we'll counter Park Pil Hyeon there.

448
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,020
No, I'll go to Mokcheon.

449
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,100
Mokcheon? That is not an important spot.

450
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,340
No. That's why that place is important.

451
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:45,400
The matter is getting bigger. That bastard Yi In Jwa has taken Prince Milpung.

452
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,360
Prince Milpung?

453
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That bastard Yi In Jwa... is talented.

454
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,110
That's all lies.

455
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:02,260
Wherever he captures a place, he promises to give grain and land. So what people wouldn't join him?

456
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:08,440
If I hadn't known he was like that, I would've followed him, even risking my life.

457
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,200
How can we block such large numbers?

458
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,040
It's not only one or two. They are more than one or two hundred thousand in the uprising army.

459
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:22,400
We'd be better to use the central army and kill them at once. Otherwise, it's impossible.

460
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,180
It's possible.

461
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:34,160
As long as we hold Yi In Jwa's ankle.  But the problem is  we have only five days.

462
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,200
 I'll give you five days. 

463
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:42,750
 If I don't hear any news in five days, I'll move the central army. 

464
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,360
If it goes past five days, the Army General with 50,000 central soldiers,

465
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,440
and 3,000 elite military officers from the Capital Five Military Departments, will gather at Anseong.

466
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,670
If this happens, there'll be no other way but for the people to bleed.

467
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,520
But I don't want even one to get hurt.

468
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,270
Even five days is too long.

469
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:09,920
Although His Majesty promised five days, he'll never sit still and wait for you.

470
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,080
Then, three days.

471
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,520
Our goal is to grasp Yi In Jwa's ankle within three days.

472
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,110
General from the Capital five Military Departments!

473
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:53,180
From this point on, I allow you to possess guns and gunpowder.

474
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,120
So distribute the guns to each soldier from the Capital Five Military Departments.

475
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,620
Right now, how many soldiers  are there at the Chongyeong Department? (Military Dept. in charge of  Gyeonggi Province)

477
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,370
There are one General, three Captains,

478
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,840
and 1,350 officers.

479
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,620
Separate the 1,000 who've trained well among them,

480
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,390
form the elite unit and await my order.

481
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

482
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,780
Also, Su Eu Military Department,  reduce the guard for the  four Capital Gates  to half.

483
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:31,250
All soldiers at Civilian Defense Militia, Royal Guards, and Fireworks Militia, maintain guard against the threat of danger.

484
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,320
Your Majesty.

486
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,160
Baek Dae Gil left for Mokcheon?

487
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:46,370
Yes, Your Majesty. This humble subject will also leave right after seeing you.

488
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:51,340
How about you? Do you think it's possible?

489
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:58,020
Without the soldiers, do you think it's possible to block Yi In Jwa?

490
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:04,460
Even though scholars, farmers, craftsmen, and merchants all mix together,  they are as many as 200,000.

491
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,590
However, I trust Baek Dae Gil.

492
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,370
 Trust me. 

493
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:19,360
 It's not for my sake but for your sake. That's my wish. 

494
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:29,040
 Baek Dae Gil, I also believe you. 

495
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,580
 However, as the King sitting on this throne, 

496
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,750
 I can't trust you. 

497
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,370
 Mokcheon 

498
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:43,150
 I won't allow any trust. 

499
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,910
Who are you?

500
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,350
Who are you? I want to meet Leader Yi In Jwa.

501
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,830
Who are you?

502
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:04,570
I heard you would give the people the land you took. Is it true?

503
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:10,010
That's true. His Highness also approved it.

504
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,890
I'm Prince Milpung, Yi Tan.

505
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,920
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

506
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:33,120
We, the citizens of Mokcheon, pledged to be with Yi In Jwa together.

507
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,030
They say the people's voice is the heaven's voice.

508
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,650
Unpack and give the soldiers a break.

509
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,820
Feed the horses generously.

510
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,440
Then...

511
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:56,090
I'll go across to the Gukju Mountain Fortress tonight.

512
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,220
I got it. Let's go.

513
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,390
Feed the soldiers well.

514
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,480
Well, did you do what I ordered?

515
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,840
By the way, someone came and is looking for you.

516
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,510
My Liege.

517
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,400
What brings you up here?

518
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,700
Baek Dae Gil.

519
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,600
Yes. The King summoned Baek Dae Gil.

520
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:57,160
What is this? Is it him again?

521
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,240
Baek Dae Gil.

522
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,640
 Yi In Jwa! 

523
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,000
 Live hiding like that forever, like a rat, 

524
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,070
 without  showing your ugly face. 

525
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,190
So did you deliver my intention to the Sorons?

526
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:24,520
Yes. However, the movement in the palace is not  ordinary.

527
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,780
It seems the King will take action soon.

528
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:50,730
In the case of the King, he'll probably block me even by using  the central army.

529
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,380
Go back to the capital as soon as possible and watch  movements inside the palace closely.

530
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,230
Baek Dae Gil.

531
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,330
If he takes action, it'll be troublesome, right?

532
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,350
Fate is like that.

533
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:19,100
Even if you want to avoid it, if it's fate you can't avoid it.

534
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:26,390
If we meet each other again, then whether he dies or I do,

535
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,860
it must be one of us.

536
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,320
Where are you, Baek Dae Gil?

537
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,950
They're welcoming them so openly.

538
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:46,290
Because they're deceived by two faces of the beast.

539
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,250
I'll show the people

540
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:52,230
what kind of bastard Yi In Jwa is.

541
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,740
Everybody is going to do well, right?

542
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:33,150
 My father and Master are more reliable than anybody else. 

543
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,710
Who is this Yi In Jwa?

544
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,650
If I have to tell about  this ill-mannered bastard...

545
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,880
 Both Boss Hong and Yeon Hwa as well... 

546
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,730
The bad rumors of Yi In Jwa have started to spread in the streets of the capital.

547
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,900
Boss Hong's mouth is still alive.

548
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:39,360
Well, are you ready?

549
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,900
Yes.

550
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,360
You must succeed. If you fail today...

551
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,350
The Army General is standing by outside the capital.

552
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,760
 The central army will move. 

553
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:03,320
As I mentioned, their weakness is that they don't know each other's faces because they were gathered hastily from the eight provinces.

554
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,320
We are taking advantage of this weakness. Do you understand?

555
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,090
Yes.

556
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,430
I was very tired so I had a drink. Now my body is relaxing.

557
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:27,070
You must be tired too. Go get some rest, too. We'll guard here.

558
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,350
- Should we? 
 - All right, work hard.

559
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,400
Don't worry about here.

560
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:59,540
You're cooking this much soup? How can we eat it all?

561
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,510
How many people are here? At least, if we cook this much then they'll have enough to eat.

562
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,260
  Boss Hong gave us this. 

563
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:26,770
 Eat one more bowl of rice. 

564
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,540
  Enjoy your meal. 

565
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,990
  Enjoy your meal and eat a lot. 

566
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,130
Hey!

567
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,510
We'll cross Anseong now. And with this great force, we'll proceed to the capital.

568
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,980
Everyone, are you prepared for that?

569
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,410
- Yes. 
 - My Liege!

570
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,620
- What happened?  
 - We have big trouble.

571
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:27,330
We don't know whether the soldiers ate something wrong, but all of them got diarrhea.

572
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,360
Leader! The food supply storehouse is on fire!

573
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,430
Fire! Fire!

574
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,360
Fire! Aigoo, what should we do?

575
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,000
Bring water!

576
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,820
Pour water!

577
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,570
Leader!  All the horses have scattered.

578
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,430
How did you take care of the horses?

579
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:08,980
The sudden diarrhea, the food supply, and even horses...

580
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:15,710
A rat has snuck into our army camp.

581
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,480
Do you think Dae Gil is okay?

582
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,710
Do you know the most useless worry in the world? Worrying about Dae Gil.

583
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,150
The traitor Yi In Jwa and his bands who dazzle the people with seductive words

584
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:44,360
and  throw contempt on the royal court with a national crisis,

585
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,390
massacre all of them to the last man.

586
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,320
Yes, Your Majesty!

587
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:10,420
It has been a while, Yi In Jwa.

588
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,980
Baek Dae Gil!

589
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,710
♬  Will I be able to see time stop then?  ♬

590
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:32,690
♬  Will your heart be with me then?  ♬

591
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,940
♬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  ♬

592
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:45,410
♬  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  ♬

593
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,770
♬  Because the words which have not yet been said  remain  ♬

594
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,750
