2
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,040
Why did Baek Man Geum's child come here?

3
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,620
Why do you think?  I'm here to break your gambling house.

4
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,710
To break it? You're going to break our gambling house?

5
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,820
Right. I'm going to break all of them.

6
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,240
All the gambling houses in Hanyang. I'll break them all.

7
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,620
 Episode 11 

8
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,210
Dae Gil, have you now become a tiger?

9
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,850
Why would a person become a beast? I am just a human being.

10
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,290
So then, you're going to beat me?

11
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,710
From this point on, I'm going to cut off your arms and legs, and then your neck.

12
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,170
Do you want to make a bet?  On whether I can do it or not?

13
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,040
 Kim Che Geon 

14
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,060
 Where did you get this mask? 

15
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,730
Know your enemy and yourself and you will never lose.

16
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,190
Know my enemy and myself.

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,310
Do you even know the difference between your enemy and your ally?

18
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,240
How pathetic.  I thought you had just broken through your shell and come out into the world.

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,380
You've tied yourself up with your thirst for meaningless revenge.

20
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,940
It's time for you to get over your father's death.

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,550
You... would have died more than a hundred times at my hands

22
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,420
if I was only thinking about avenging my father.

23
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,380
You need me.  That's why you can't kill me.

24
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,070
That big picture that you're drawing... In order to complete that picture, you need me.

25
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,660
Have you just realized this now?

26
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,580
No.  You're the very one who should wake up from your dream.

27
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:35,360
What can you actually do for the ambition I  harbor

28
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,310
and for the great cause I dream of?

29
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,350
I know at least one thing for sure.

30
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,340
You can never be an ally.

31
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,400
Neither to me, nor to the king, nor to the citizens of this country.

32
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,010
 Ace of Sixes 

33
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,930
This little rascal.

34
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,160
Here, there is no one who will run away from an incoming fight.
 (Gae Jak Du: Dog Blade) 

35
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,020
Take your time coming and don't rush.

36
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,760
I'll see you often from now on.

37
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,730
Remember that I'm letting you live today.

38
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:56,500
What you see is not everything, Baek Dae Gil.

39
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,760
Confucius once said, "Set your heart upon the Way.

40
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,120
Support yourself by its virtue."
  (Lee Woon Jing: Lee In Jwa's grandfather) 

41
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,620
 Recite what it means.
(Lee Woon Jing: Lee In Jwa's grandfather) 

42
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,060
Confucius once said
 (Lee Hyun Jwa: Lee In Jwa) 

43
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,110
Set your heart upon the Way according to Moral Virtue.

44
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,830
 All those doctrines of eulogy. 

45
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,340
 Back then, I thought they were the truth. 

46
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,940
 Die, Bastard. 

47
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,290
 However, the bare face of the world I encountered was far from the one in books. 

48
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,620
 Even after being trampled in the Japanese Invasion and the Manchu War, 

49
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,630
 this country's king, and this country's ministers 

50
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,640
  would not even take a young teenager's advice. 

51
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,030
 Even though they had Confucius and Mencius as their teachers, 

52
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,820
 it was a world in which the subjects could never become the owners. 

53
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,870
 This impudent child. 

54
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,180
 That was the very world I was living in. 

55
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,200
 And upon the bloody Change of State brandished by the current king, everything changed. 

56
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,130
 My clan, my family, 

57
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,630
 Also my life, Lee In Jwa's life. 

58
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,490
 Stop! 

59
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,980
 Father. 

60
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,080
 Father... 

61
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,580
 Father! Father! 

62
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,850
 Father. 

63
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,400
 I hid myself behind that white mask, 

64
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,210
 I waited for the day when I could grasp the world in my hands. 

65
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,330
 Just as the young teenager Lee Hyeon Jwa 

66
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:08,010
 was born again with the name of Lee In Jwa, Baek Dae Gil, you are also going to take that path. 

67
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,800
 That difficult road that I walked. 

68
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,270
Hey!

69
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,800
 Hwang Jin Gi 

70
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,680
Do you want to settle things right now?

71
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,800
A mere dog's pup got so fierce.

72
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,250
I'm just asking because I'm curious.

73
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,990
The guy, Kim Chae Geon's disciple.

74
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,320
Are you really thinking of making that guy the king?

75
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,850
Why? You don't believe it?

76
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,370
Why would you make that guy king?  What about the Crown Prince?

77
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,600
The Crown Prince is a discarded play.

78
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,760
I'm looking past that.  I'm talking about after the Crown Prince dies.

79
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,140
No matter how, such an impulsive amateur...

80
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,280
He can ultimately do things the current Crown Prince born and raised in the palace can never do.

81
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,760
The great cause that can never happen or start under the feet of his Majesty.

82
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,940
The day where status and ranks break, when the people become the owners

83
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,680
will only happen through someone who is of the king's blood.

84
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,940
and  has experienced the hell of many difficulties.

85
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:13,690
Baek Dae Gil is the only guy who can do it.

86
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:22,270
Just wait and see.  Before long, Baek Dae Gil's name will be known to the whole world.

87
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,420
You are going to defeat Lee In Jwa.

88
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,000
There have been a lot of inexperienced people like you.

89
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,370
The thing is, do you know what happened to all of them?

90
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,550
They all went to the afterlife.

91
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:49,730
So, you made a ledger about all the wicked deeds the merchants have done.
 (Prince Yeoning: later King Yeongjo) 

92
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,190
And then you plan to threaten Lee In Jwa with that ledger. Are you confident you can survive after that?

93
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,790
At one point in my life... I united 1,000 nanjeons ( illegal businesses without mercantile charters ) in Hanyang,

94
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,550
and led them to success.

95
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,070
Then...

96
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,700
why on earth did you abandon the cornered non-chartered people,

97
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,990
and try to sell the ledgers you'd made to Lee In Jwa?

98
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:22,850
I had my personal reasons. Actually, it was because Lee In Jwa offered me 500 nyangs.

99
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,240
How much will Your Highness offer me?

100
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,880
How much do you want?

101
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,970
A thousand nyangs.

102
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,720
Your joke has gone too far.

103
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,810
If I hand over this ledger to Your Highness,

104
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,420
then do you think Lee In Jwa will let me live?

105
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:53,350
Five hundred nyangs for the ledger, and the other 500 nyangs as the price of my life.

106
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,280
Fine, I will give you 1,000 nyangs.

107
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,370
However.... You must personally stand in front of the other ministers,

108
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,090
and testify about this matter.

109
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,870
So what will you do now?

110
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:31,240
I don't need the money, just ensure my safety.

111
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,350
Thank you.

112
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:44,250
I will definitely ensure your safety.

113
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,240
Until that man stands in the royal court and testifies, protect him.

114
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,220
He must not die.

115
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,010
Yes, Your Highness.

116
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:13,740
But Your Highness... It seems Baek Dae Gil has arrived in Hanyang.

117
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,550
All right, take a guess! Take a guess! Where could it have gone?

118
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,010
Where did it go?

119
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,140
It was you, Your Highness?

120
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,210
Sit.

121
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,860
A noble like you is drinking in the middle of the day without any serving girls.

122
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,940
Did you get dumped?

123
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,690
Aren't you curious about what happened to Dam Seo?

124
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,050
I don't care about her anymore, because I have more important things to care about.

125
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,850
Lee In Jwa. Am I right?

126
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,820
Have a drink from me.

127
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,490
Why, this bastard...

128
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,420
Do you really not know any manners?
 (he should receive the drink with two hands) 

129
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,490
So what is the reason you wanted to see me?

130
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,630
Even if we can't be friends, I'm sure we can be allies for the same cause.

131
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,770
- Allies? 
 - Aren't you thinking of taking revenge for your father's death?

132
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,280
Right now, Lee In Jwa would've been on the road to the afterlife

133
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,200
if I desired only revenge.

134
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,950
There is an even greater cause than your desire for revenge.

135
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,920
Then, how about you? What's your reason for attacking Lee In Jwa?

136
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,800
Just like you, I have harbored a grudge against him for quite some time.

137
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,950
Why? Do you not want to become allies?

138
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,690
I have things I must do on my own.

139
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,700
You do whatever you need to. I don't want you to get in my way.

140
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,950
Are you rejecting my generous offer?

141
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,510
It's because Your Highness' generous offer just doesn't feel like a generous offer.

142
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,670
I'll take my leave now.

143
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,870
That sword.

144
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:15,290
Do you not know the meaning of His Majesty entrusting that sword to you?

145
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,310
Meaning?

146
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,920
 There are different types of swords. 

147
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,780
 There are swords that kill people and swords that save people. 

148
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,910
 Which will it be? Which type of sword will you hold in your hands? 

149
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:56,550
Instead of thinking about it a hundred times, take one decisive action. That's the meaning behind this sword.

150
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:11,050
"Instead of thinking about it a hundred times, take one decisive action." That's what you think it means?

151
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,260
Then, are we done discussing matters for today?
 (Crown Prince Yoon: later King Gyeongjong) 

152
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,780
Forgive me for being late, Your Majesty.

153
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,300
I, Prince Yeoning, have another matter to address.

154
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,130
This matter is about people who have received severe punishment and have died as a result.

155
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,990
Is it wrong for a servant to leave the sight of their master's eyes?

156
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,240
Is it right to kill someone for stealing one rice cake because of hunger?

157
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:26,450
Then do you Ministers, who drove these people to starvation, have no fault?

158
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,970
Your Highness! Punishing someone who commits a crime is an obvious matter.

159
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,180
Your Highness. How can you question His Majesty's administration of the—

160
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,190
So...

161
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,450
What is your point?

162
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,040
The first things that I want to address are execution,

163
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,950
branding criminals as a punishment, beatings, and tattooing the face. I want to get rid of these severe punishments.

164
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,480
The second thing I would like to address is, in order to listen to the complaints of the people who have been wronged,

165
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,300
please revive the sinmungo.
  ("petition drum" that citizens can strike to voice their complaints) 

166
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,820
Also, the cloth tax imposed only on the commoners, for exemption from  the military service,

167
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,050
needs to be adjusted to be imposed upon every household, including every rank  in society, whether it be Confucian scholars

168
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,090
or nobles who hold government positions.

169
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,060
I urge you to make these changes.

170
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,730
If I do that, will it become a more peaceful reign?

171
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:40,230
This ledger contains the records of taxes the chartered monopoly merchants have evaded,

172
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,650
and sure enough, the military supplies they have hidden away during loading or unloading at the Port of Mapo.

173
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:51,890
It even contains the records of the names and the amount of money they were given for bribes. All of it is written here.

174
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,130
So... What are you trying to say?

175
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:11,750
The last thing that I want to address is the abolition of Geumnanjeongwon  (the system under which a merchant was given a monopoly to buy and sell a product). 

176
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,810
 Abolition of Geumnanjeongwon? Is he out of his mind? 

177
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:25,350
Your Majesty, the current Geumnanjeongwon serves only the rich and  satisfies only the greed of a few high officials.

178
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,910
Tax evasion and omission.  Abolish the Geumnanjeongwon that's stained by fraud.

179
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,950
And please be a strength to those non-chartered merchants whose existence is ephemeral.

180
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,780
Where did you come from?

181
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,440
Anseong?

182
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,640
- Did it rain there yet? 
- It hasn't rained yet.

183
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,130
Aigo, damn it.

184
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,550
Prepare some for your parents beforehand.

185
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,960
How much is this silk?

186
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,810
Ah, this...

187
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,940
This is just ordinary stuff,

188
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,600
but if you go inside, we have silks from Qing China.

189
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,280
These ones here...

190
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,090
Dae Gil! Aigo, Dae Gil..

191
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,110
Aigo, Dae Gil.

192
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,690
You've come back alive.

193
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,050
Don't you know it has long been prohibited for non-chartered merchants to sell silk here?

194
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,320
You seem like a common man.

195
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,310
Why are you all worked up?

196
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,880
But...

197
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,780
Its the national Law.
 (Geumnan Authority Privilege which created a  ban on non-chartered merchants) 

198
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,040
within 10  li  (5 km) outside the capital, any non-permitted merchant.

199
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,100
Didn't you know they cannot even sell a single pair of shoes?

200
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,730
 Geumnam Authority? 

201
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,830
What are you guys doing? Go search.

202
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,290
Hey look. Hey, look here.

203
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,510
No, these people...

204
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,150
Move aside.

205
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,900
Aigo, aigo.

206
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,520
But this valuable...

207
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,180
Do you know how hard I tried to get these?

208
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,200
You thieves!

209
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,790
Oh, no.

210
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,720
Didn't you even know about the ban on non-chartered merchants?

211
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,220
Of all items, you opened up a  cloth shop.

212
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,620
Who do you think I did this for?

213
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,140
I did this just to meet you.

214
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,320
If you talk like that, I'm disappointed.

215
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,330
You are alive and well.

216
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,400
I have to be alive to see you.

217
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,680
I was waiting for you.

218
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,000
So how goes it?

219
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,490
How was it going around mimicking teacher Baek Myeong?

220
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,250
Oh.

221
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,830
Huh?

222
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,930
What?

223
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:51,050
Give it to me. You probably earned a lot of money going around.

224
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,440
I don't have any.

225
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,040
Don't have any?

226
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,510
Look at this ingratitude.

227
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,500
Do you know how much I've put into you since you were a baby?

228
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,870
Even only by an approximate estimate, it is about—

229
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,480
About?

230
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:12,530
It's about... If I added it all together, it would be so heavy I wouldn't even be able to pick it up.

231
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,900
Use as much as you need.

232
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,070
Our Dae Gil has grown up over time.

233
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,140
It's not free money.

234
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,400
If you've received money, you have to work.

235
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,230
I have to.

236
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,340
This is the map I prepared. Do you like it?

237
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,470
This is our location,

238
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,750
and this is Hongmae Gambling House.

239
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,620
The Seoso Gate.

240
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,110
Jongro.

241
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,240
Mapo.

242
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,720
From this point on, I am going to break these three gambling houses.

243
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,280
Out of all the gambling houses in the market,

244
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,040
why these three?

245
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,870
Grandpa, what have you been doing while I was working so hard?

246
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,890
The financial supporter of Lee In Jwa, who even controls the ministers.

247
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,380
The first one is Lee In Jwa's right hand, Hong Mae, her gambling house on Yookjo Street.

248
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,190
Second, Lee In Jwa's left hand, Hwang Gwa Moon's Wolhyanggak.

249
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,170
And then Ace of Sixes from the Seoso Gate, Dog Blade from Jongro, and Swindler Golsa from Mapo.

250
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,240
These three are Lee In Jwa's legs.

251
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,770
First of all, we have to cut off his legs.

252
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:17,070
Yeah. Which one of the three are you going to beat first?

253
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,590
Ace of Sixes from the Seoso Gate.

254
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,160
 This is all because of that Ace of Sixes. 

255
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:34,520
 The reason why I am trying so hard to endure is for my father and mother's enemy. 

256
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,880
 Before I break that Ace of Sixes's neck, 

257
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,100
 I cannot die. 

258
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,700
Ace of Sixes, I am going to catch you first.

259
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,200
What in the world are you doing?

260
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,400
Your Highness, can you really say the thing that prohibits the daily survival of the non-chartered merchants

261
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
and greatly benefits the big merchants, the ban on non-chartered merchants,

262
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,840
is for the people?

263
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,760
That is the law our father personally established.

264
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,400
However, it has many weakness.

265
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,240
However, the tax revenue it produces is stabilizing the government.

266
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,540
But the people are starting to starve.

267
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,520
This ledger is only a half.

268
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,910
It has only the names of the merchants who gave bribes

269
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,270
but not the amounts or names of the people who took them.

270
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:53,030
I have the person who wrote the ledger and the witness.

271
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:59,350
And soon, the other half of the ledger will come into my hands as well.

272
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:04,710
Didn't you promise you  would become my eyes and ears?

273
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,530
I am going to do that.

274
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:16,050
But before that, you must get rid of Lee In Jwa.

275
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:24,270
The collusion between the chartered merchants and ministers of the court is part of Lee In Jwa's scheme.

276
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,610
Haven't I said this before? That  man, Lee In Jwa,  is my—

277
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,320
You said he was your friend.

278
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,680
But staying away from a friend with faults is also the duty of a king.

279
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,840
Your Majesty.

280
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,220
If you really don't intend to do it, I will.

281
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,860
I am going to catch  that man, Lee In Jwa.

282
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,190
My Liege, how come you are so calm?

283
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:27,370
Abolish the law of Market Monopoly Privileges!
Prince Yeoning only knows the one but not the other.

284
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:32,530
Through the law of Market Monopoly Privileges, the merchants who took control of the market...

285
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,510
Do you think perhaps that they only filled the Sorons' bellies?

286
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,960
Your Highness, why did you not mention anything to us either?

287
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,740
If I informed  you beforehand,

288
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,740
would you have agreed upon it?

289
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,710
Why?

290
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,100
Your common secret you've kept hidden.

291
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,520
Are you afraid that you will all be shamefully exposed?

292
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,340
Your Highness, you cannot lose ten things just to gain one.
 Lee Yee Myeong (Central Council) 

293
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,500
Minister, give up.

294
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,600
I am saying it's time for you to let it leave your hands.

295
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:19,890
Haven't you all  eaten enough already?

296
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,070
 Kim Chang Jip (Prime Minister) 

297
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,150
 Jo Il Soo (Deputy Right Minister) 

298
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,070
Even if he convinces the Noron ministers,

299
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,540
this matter won't be resolved.

300
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:56,750
 In order to abolish the ban on non-chartered merchants, the petty merchants would have to bear the tax revenue at once. 

301
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:02,370
 However, they can't budge an inch under the wiles of theAce of Sixes. 

302
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,590
May you grant allowance.

303
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,820
 And more than anything, the current king also 

304
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,990
 could not abandon the huge sum of tax revenue the chartered merchants offer him. 

305
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,950
 Royal Noble Consort Sook Bin of Haeju Choe Clan 

306
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:33,420
Royal Mother, are you ill?

307
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,940
Prince Yeoning.

308
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,950
Yes, Royal Mother.

309
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:46,150
Just why are you promoting a law that none of the ministers of any affiliation supports?

310
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:51,590
Your son plans to capture Lee In Jwa.

311
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,110
I have my thoughts on it.

312
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,380
Don't worry too much, Mother.

313
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,130
More importantly, are you feeling better?

314
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,850
Don't worry about your mother.

315
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,860
Yes.

316
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,880
Abolish the ban on non-chartered merchants?  Does this even make sense?

317
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,990
If we get rid of Market Monopoly Privileges, how will we raise enough taxes?

318
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:31,110
That's not all. What about the rent we collect from the merchants?

319
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,930
 Now that you bastards' purse strings are loose, you all must be worried sick. 

320
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,790
There's nothing I won't do for the dissolution of the Market Monopoly Privileges monopoly.

321
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:05,970
As all your excellencies are aware, I am a fearless son of a concubine who came up from a water maid.

322
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,080
I have nothing to fear.

323
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,640
If you don't want to be like a dog who has had its bone taken away,

324
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:25,110
give up Lee In Jwa.

325
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,360
I'm telling you all to sever your ties with him.

326
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,390
Then... I may be inclined to be considerate.

327
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,430
As for that fellow Lee In Jwa...

328
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,790
I'm a bit late.

329
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,240
Excellency, why don't you do so?

330
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,230
Please kick me out, Sir.

331
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,620
Kick me out according to Prince Yeoning's wishes.

332
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,690
In addition, open the grain storehouses that we've been accumulating with great effort

333
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,540
to share with the people.

334
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:30,460
Your Excellency, you just need to act according to what I say.

335
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:36,550
You don't think, perhaps, that I wouldn't be able to go after Yeoning?

336
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,580
 Drink up. 

337
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,650
Give me some too.

338
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,660
 Kill the fellow who gave our ledger to Prince Yeoning 

339
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,610
Here, here, here.

340
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,760
 Ten guards total, and even an Inspector General. 

341
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,170
It's coming.

342
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,110
Drinking is good. Here, here, here.

343
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,030
Have some, My Lord.

344
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,840
Here.

345
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,710
Drink, drink, drink.

346
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,180
Look here. What're you doing there? You should come here and have a drink.

347
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,800
Here, here, here.

348
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,580
 Bring me the ledger. 

349
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,200
 Y-Y-Y-yes. 

350
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:17,240
 Keep in mind that excessive greed will lead to a fall. 

351
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:37,540
What. There's plenty of liquor left. You should have some.

352
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,300
I'm good.

353
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,240
Elder!

354
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,350
Elder! Look here! Elder!

355
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,930
Elder! Elder!

356
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,980
Sir, do I have to do such lowly things?

357
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,640
Have you already forgotten the promise we made?

358
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,130
 From now, your gambling house is mine 

359
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,400
  But don't be disappointed.  

360
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,600
 As promised if you work for me three times, 

361
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,410
 I will return this gambling house to you. 

362
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,860
Then there are just two times left now.

363
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,080
Why don't we play some music?

364
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,580
Would a betrayed Yeoning stay put?

365
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,750
- Aigoo, Father!
 -  What the heck happened?

366
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,050
He was poisoned.

367
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:19,750
I told you to be on your guard.

368
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:27,220
You're the one who killed my father. You seduced him and made him die!

369
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,660
Save him. Bring him back to life!

370
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:38,090
I am sorry. I am truly sorry.

371
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,030
Piss off. Get out of my sight!

372
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,240
Your Highness!

373
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,130
You.

374
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,480
What's your name?

375
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,430
It's Ga Yeon.

376
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,760
I see.

377
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,670
How can you down alcohol at a time like this?

378
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,010
You set fire to someone else's house, yet you are drinking.

379
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,110
Your Highness was the one who first placed your hands on what was mine.

380
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,600
And so, is killing someone to avoid the consequences one of your methods?

381
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:53,450
If that's so,  these people here will one day die by your sword,

382
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,880
since you don't know how to value people. Am I wrong?

383
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,690
So what are you attempting to gain by coming here?

384
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:20,910
I didn't come here to gain, but to give something in return.

385
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,930
So are you planning on putting me to your sword?

386
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,570
No. I have something even better.

387
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,870
Stop.

388
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,560
How's that? Does it hurt?

389
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,390
It's disappointing.

390
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,090
I was expecting a more plausible reaction from you.

391
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,930
The real deal will slowly be revealed.

392
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,190
You can count on looking forward to it.

393
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,700
Your Highness,

394
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,380
I'm wondering if you've just instigated an unnecessary fight.

395
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,420
To you, do I look like an incompetent fool who can't tell one thing from another?

396
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,020
Follow me.

397
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,280
  You seduced my father and made him die. Save him. 

398
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,990
  Bring him back to life! 

399
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,440
Without a proper funeral...

400
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,250
- Right now, find that man who claims to be that elder's son.
 - Pardon?

401
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,850
That person holds the key.

402
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,560
Be careful about what you say. 
  (Baek Joong Gi: Head Merchant of the Mercantile Monopoly League) 

403
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:26,480
 Mercantile Monopoly League 

404
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,480
Why did you pretend to be that man's son?

405
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,990
You must have set your sights on the dead elder's ledgers.

406
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,150
Without a doubt you must have them. The missing half of the ledgers.

407
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,200
Both must be obtained to pressure, negotiate an agreement,

408
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,950
- or fight against the marketplace merchants.
 - What do you want?

409
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:07,010
This is all to save your small-scale merchants. Please give up the ledgers.

410
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,920
How can I believe you? The government officials have no reason to stand by our side.

411
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,920
Furthermore, you are the King's—

412
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,630
I, the son of this nation's king,

413
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,510
and called Prince by government officials high and low,

414
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,780
am fighting against all of  them,

415
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,150
staking everything I have.

416
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,370
What do I need to do for you to trust me?

417
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,460
 Ace 

418
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,690
Our lives are no longer ours.
 Ace 

419
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,540
In order to stay alive, we borrowed some money from the Ace of Sixes.

420
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,670
We weren't able to pay back the money, so we became his slaves.

421
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:23,250
Dying, or living, our lives belong to that bastard, Ace of Sixes.

422
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,750
Save us from the Ace of Sixes.

423
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,030
Then we will put our trust in you.

424
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,790
I will hand over the ledger afterward.

425
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,800
Where is the man called "Ace of Sixes"?

426
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,700
 Seoso Gate 

427
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:52,350
This is where all the capital's thugs and beggars can be found.

428
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:01,750
Even stooping to selling people and corpses, they are the evilest of the evil.

429
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:06,850
If he were ever to die and go to the afterworld, the bastard whom even the king of Hades would refuse to take is

430
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,710
the Ace of Sixes.

431
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:21,480
The reason that Seoso Gate is called the root of corpses is because of the Ace of Sixes.

432
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,470
Even if you are fine when you enter, you go out as a corpse.

433
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,370
How dare you, bastard. What treacherous actions!

434
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,160
You wench, you really...

435
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:56,450
Look. Living or dead, now you're mine. Understood?

436
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,320
 Your name is Ban Poon and now you're mine.  

437
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:11,150
 Look. Until you pay this back, you can't leave here alive. Got it? 

438
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,900
 Oh ho. 

439
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,880
As always, you still act before you think.

440
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,610
It's better than being only full of talk.

441
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,320
- Step aside. 
 - Do you have a plan?

442
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,670
As I told you already, I have my own business to take care of.

443
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,860
What does he put his trust in that he's so self-confident?

444
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,990
Which bastard did that?

445
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:23,530
 Ace of Sixes Gambling House 

446
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,280
- You have money? 
 - Let me check.

447
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,330
I seem to have forgotten it.

448
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,020
There.

449
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,510
Please appraise me well.

450
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,550
What are you doing?

451
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,530
It's because I have to test your abilities

452
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,050
if we are to have a good partnership.

453
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,270
Then you should've given me a heads-up or something.

454
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:30,190
Not letting you know, that was my plan.

455
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,520
So what are you going to do anyway?

456
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,320
Are you saying that you'll take part in it as well?

457
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,470
Do I have to spell it out for you?

458
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,000
Look me straight in the eye,

459
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,800
I'm still young and very strong as you can see,

460
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,900
so shouldn't I get at least 100 nyangs?

461
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,140
I understand.

462
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,390
No way. This guy got 100 nyangs. Why am I  getting only 20 nyangs?

463
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,630
I'll make you 30 nyangs then.

464
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,170
I'm worth 100 nyangs too.

465
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,120
Skip!

466
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,910
Then stamp me even for 30 nyangs.

467
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:07,800
Wow. A prince in the gambling world is only worth 30 nyangs.

468
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,550
What did you say?

469
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,350
Strangely even those kinds of people have good insight, you know.

470
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,970
You punk...

471
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,320
What? Am I wrong?

472
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,890
Of course. If you're worth 100 nyangs,

473
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:24,860
does it make sense that I'm worth 30 nyangs?

474
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,460
Your asking price was evaluated by that person, not me.

475
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,660
Oh, you punk, really. You've been continuously speaking informally to me for a while now.

476
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,010
Hasn't enough time passed for you to be used to it by now?

477
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,720
- What did you say? 
 - Hey!

478
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,210
Do you guys want to die right now?

479
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,180
Hey, throw them out.

480
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,290
I see that your fists can be quite useful.

481
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,750
Know that you're alive today because of me.

482
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,800
Hey. Tell the Ace of Sixes to show himself.

483
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,360
Hey guys...

484
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,240
Look! This high-born son has lost his sense of fear.

485
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,430
Why are you creating an even bigger ruckus?

486
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,340
This is all part of my plan.

487
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,690
From this point on, let's each do our individual parts.

488
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,850
So you came.

489
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,640
I heard you're here to break the gambling house.

490
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,580
So why have you come empty-handed?

491
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,550
 One Hundred 

492
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,460
I am worth 100 nyangs.

493
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,020
Hey guys. An honored guest has graced us with his presence.

494
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:10,890
Though those guys are worth 10 nyangs, no one cares about them anymore.

495
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,160
So they're putting their lives at stake to earn some money...

496
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,820
How can I turn them away empty-handed?

497
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,080
They have to be used at least as baduk ( go ) stones.

498
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,630
What? Doesn't suit your taste?

499
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,350
Now then... Try besting this place.

500
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,590
If this place becomes yours,

501
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,630
then you can do as you please, right?

502
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,660
In exchange,

503
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,070
if I win, you're dead.

504
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:31,040
 If you go around to the back of the gambling house, there's a door where outsiders are not permitted. 

505
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,350
 It's there. Our lives. 

506
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,380
  Save us from the Ace of Sixes. 

507
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,490
 Then we will put our trust in you 

508
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:47,070
 I will hand over the ledger afterward. 

509
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,410
What's going on?

510
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:16,490
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

511
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,390
Don't lose too much in one turn.

512
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:55,750
It's best to savor the screams of terror one by one.

513
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,890
You're not playing?

514
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:09,030
Then should I go first?

515
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,740
It won't be fun if you do that.

516
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,930
My neck's gonna fall out from waiting.

517
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,760
Prince, Sir.

518
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,230
Hey, Ace of Sixes. Stop playing around and let's have a real go at it.

519
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,680
What did you say?

520
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,120
Seeing all the deeds you've done. I no longer want to be a person.

521
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,960
I would like to quarter you to death, but I'm holding back right now with great difficulty.

522
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,020
So... Stop with your coy tricks and deal with me straight.

523
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,360
Do you want to die?!

524
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,920
There we go.

525
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,170
You need to act in that manner

526
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:37,080
in order for me to kill you.

527
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,710
Stop.

528
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,910
It's been awhile,

529
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,160
Baek Dae Gil.

530
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,680
Seol Im

531
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:59,410
♬  As I see your back drift further away from me.  ♬

532
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:05,010
♬  I won't wave goodbye.  ♬

533
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:10,660
♬   Because as long as we're under the same sky.  ♬

534
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:16,370
♬  We're bound to meet again.  ♬

535
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,300
Jackpot 
 ♬   Though we're far apart momentarily.  ♬

536
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,360
 Who are you to apologize in my place? 

537
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,330
 Without being grounded, 

538
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,980
 you're being dragged around. 

539
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,700
 - Do you know where Baek Dae Gil is staying? 
 - Call me Hyungnim. 

540
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,410
 What's so important about it? We're friends. 

541
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:31,520
 It seems we're not late. 

542
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,510
 I would like to wager on the winning side as well. 

543
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,670
 It's 5000 nyangs. 

544
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,180
  Don't touch the girl. 

545
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,410
  Remove your hand. I am now one of Dog Blade's people. 

546
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,250
 Hurry and open that door before I smash it to pieces. 

547
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,570
 - Who are you?
 - I'll save you, so how about we leave together? 

548
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:49,580
  To take out that badge of shame on your body is to kill the person you love.
