1
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,560
 Episode 19 

2
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,880
You couldn't kill him?

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,870
Was it Baek Dae Gil or Prince Yeoning

4
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,430
who made your sword waver?

5
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,260
Yi In Jwa's adoptive daughter... 
  (Kim Che Geon) 

6
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,860
sacrificed herself.

7
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,650
 King Sookjong 

8
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,500
For the crime of being unable to carry out the royal order,

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,260
this lowly servant will pay with his life.

10
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,550
Kill me, Your Majesty.

11
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,410
Truly

12
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,400
this is a tenacious ill-fated relationship.

13
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,250
 Prince Yeonryeong
 (Yi Hwon, King Sookjong's sixth son )

14
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,350
Be resentful towards your father, the Current Crown.
 Yi In Jwa 

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,090
Now either I, Yi In Jwa, will die,

16
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,500
or the Current Crown will die.

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,450
One of the two.

18
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,000
In order for this to end, one of the two needs to die.

19
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,420
I will surely slash the neck of the Current Crown.

20
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,650
Go into the afterworld and await your father.

21
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,840
Your Highness!

22
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,620
Oh, my...

23
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,560
You do not wish to die, do you?

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,330
No, sir.

25
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,280
This instant, please take Prince Yeonryeong's body,

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,760
cover the scar, and dress him in a burial robe.

27
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,100
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,300
Moo Myeong, you prepare the coffin, and summon Mother Hwanggu.

29
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,270
Yes, My Liege.

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,830
First call the Soron faction to Prince Yeonryeong's residence.

31
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,610
Where is His Highness?

32
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,130
H-H-He is in his room.

33
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,700
Your Highness.

34
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,990
Your Highness, this is Kim Il Gyeong. 
  (Jo Il Soo, Kim Il Gyeong, Choi Yi Seok) 

35
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,610
No, how are you...?

36
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,440
Okay, please enter.

37
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,760
What are you scheming? Why are you in Prince Yeonryeong's residence...?

38
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,060
That's!

39
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,100
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

40
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,170
- This...
 - Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,800
Was this your doing?

42
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,280
I'M ASKING YOU WHETHER IT WAS YOUR DOING!

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,960
Pay your proper respects.

44
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,600
This...

45
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,110
The Current Crown's life is at an end,

46
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,960
His Highness the Crown Prince is seriously ill.

47
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,900
Even if he does ascend to the throne, could he last a year?

48
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:42,080
Wasn't Prince Yeonryeong a thorn in the side of both the Soron and Noron factions?

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,750
So was it you who disrupted the royal bloodline?

50
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,510
Do you have evidence that I did it?

51
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,350
Soon the Noron faction will arrive.

52
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,020
The Sorons have nothing to lose.

53
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,770
It is a golden opportunity

54
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,110
to expel Prince Yeoning and fatally weaken the Norons.

55
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,290
You are crazy. Even if you're crazed, you're completely insane!

56
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,240
Do you know why!

57
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,750
I met you first, Your Excellency.

58
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,830
A sharp sword.

59
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,470
 I will put a sword into your hands. So with those hands,  

60
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,030
 how about you do away with the Noron ministers? 

61
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
The sharper the blade, the greater its power.

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,850
You don't know if with my sword, you can cut off the Norons in one blow.

63
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,670
Shut up!

64
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,550
What are you hesitating for!? You must arrest this fellow immediately!

65
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,760
Benefit the Crown Prince

66
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,860
and protect Joseon.

67
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,960
There's no time.

68
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,340
What should be done?

69
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,630
What do you mean what should be done about something that angers both the heavens and the people?

70
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,940
Arrest the criminal immediately.

71
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,710
Wait.

72
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,940
Isn't it already spilled water?

73
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,770
Your Excellency. Perhaps...?

74
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,320
Your  Highness, this is Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip.

75
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,870
 Tell us what happened. 

76
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,520
 Answer me honestly 

77
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,120
 Tell them  you saw a young man. 

78
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,850
I-I-I s-saw a young man.

79
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,650
 Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip 

80
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,150
 Yi Yi Myeong 

81
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,500
Do you suspect Prince Yeoning?

82
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,930
Speak for yourself, Your Excellency.

83
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,710
How can it be known without any evidence?

84
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,220
If the situation should become a bigger issue,

85
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,960
the attacks will be directed toward Prince Yeoning.

86
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,320
For you ministers who were standing there so plainly in the room of the deceased Prince Yeonryeong,

87
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,860
to corner Prince Yeoning with this!

88
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,600
Who would benefit most from Prince Yeonryeong's death?

89
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,700
If this is how you are going to behave, then I will not just stand still and watch it.

90
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,900
That's what I'm saying.

91
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,810
If Your Excellency convinces Prince Yeoning,

92
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,860
I will diligently be sure to convince the Crown Prince.

93
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,840
To form an alliance...?

94
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,530
 If the situation should become a bigger issue, 

95
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,490
 the attacks will be directed toward Prince Yeoning. 

96
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,530
I would like to suggest you return.

97
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,580
Have you looked into the whereabouts of His Highness Prince Yeoning?

98
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,280
His quarters are always empty. He even eludes his guards.  
  (Left Prime Minister Yi Geon Myeong) 

99
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,070
There is not a thing to be seen or heard from him.

100
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,740
Bring out more liquor.

101
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,650
 Prince Yeoning (future King Yeongjo) 

102
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,220
Is there no one there?

103
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,210
No one...

104
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,560
Baek Dae Gil, my gambler brother.

105
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,990
You're really drunk.

106
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,160
I am not drunk.

107
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,360
In the end, I've been left alone.

108
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,420
Please get up. I'll take you home.

109
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,720
You too will leave soon.

110
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,370
Everyone has left.

111
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,760
Everyone I like

112
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,330
eventually leaves, one by one.

113
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,670
Royal Mother, too.

114
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,020
Dam Seo, too.

115
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,770
♬    The image of your back receding   ♬

116
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,490
♬    I shall not wave a hand    ♬

117
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,050
♬    For as long as we both exist under the same sky   ♬

118
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,350
♬   We will definitely meet again   ♬

119
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,630
Your Highness!

120
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,150
♬   As just a short distance afar   ♬

121
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,670
♬    As long as I breathe and my heart beats   ♬

122
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,750
♬    My heart will always be by your side   ♬

123
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:22,750
♬    May you never forget   ♬

124
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,200
Dae Gil, what's wrong?

125
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,300
It's nothing.

126
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,140
Was she your fiancée?

127
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,790
What is it, the mourning mood?

128
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,340
It's something he can't say.

129
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,220
Even if I just look at Dae Gil's face, I know very well.

130
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,310
I won't say I'm sorry.

131
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,650
- However... 
 - Master, aren't you the one at fault here?

132
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,150
Because Dam Seo had chosen that path.

133
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,400
But...

134
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,790
What did Dam Seo do wrong?

135
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,380
Innocent Dam Seo has died.

136
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,760
Cry it out.

137
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,940
You'll feel better if you cry it out.

138
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,780
You must cry in order to laugh again.

139
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,550
Including the mother I just barely met again,

140
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,460
why is it that it happens to me, every single time.

141
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,290
Why must I... be the only one to lose people I love?

142
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,250
I couldn't protect them.

143
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,370
I couldn't protect them, you hear?

144
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,740
You did as much as you could.

145
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,450
Acute indigestion? Have you confirmed it?

146
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,850
Confirmations have been done by the Police Bureau and the Palace Physician's Court.

147
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,830
This lowly servant also confirmed with his own two eyes.

148
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,160
Has this been reported to the Royal Father?

149
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,950
Your Highness, I did go to Yoonbok Palace.

150
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,630
However His Majesty's illness is grave and I could not make the report.

151
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,010
Tomorrow, as soon as the sun rises, I will tell him personally.

152
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,810
Minsters, please put special care into Hwon's funeral.

153
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,430
Yes, Your Highness.

154
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,890
I can't believe we are working together during our lives, Your Excellency.

155
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:57,010
There will be no occasion to work with you all again in the future.

156
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,270
Anyway, we have to be united as one voice tomorrow.

157
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:08,790
Though His Majesty's anger would be a problem, it is also obvious that Prince Yeoning will be overly emotional as well.

158
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,150
Your Highness.

159
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,410
Your Highness!

160
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,100
Hwon.

161
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,380
Move aside! Move. Step aside!

162
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,270
Wait, what the heck is going on?

163
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,190
His Highness Prince Yeonryeong has passed away.

164
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,090
His Highness Prince Yeonryeong has passed away.

165
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,110
What? His Highness Prince Yeonryeong kicked the bucket?

166
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,770
Yes.

167
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,670
 I mean, what casket are you asking me for this late at night? 

168
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,420
  Our gambling house isn't a place where we serve corpses on platters, either. 

169
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,050
 He sure orders me to do all kinds of unusual errands. 

170
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,590
 So. Are you going to give it to us or not? 
 ( Hwang Jin Gi ) 

171
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,910
 No matter what a lunatic you are, collecting His Highness's neck is something we shouldn't do. 

172
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,210
 Really, this is driving me crazy. 

173
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,050
 Won't I be maimed just for giving you a coffin? 

174
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:50,050
Oh, no. It's not like it's a common person.  It's the prince.

175
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,970
It's already a fixed game. Would I die just because I fold a card?

176
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,870
- Listen carefully, okay? 
 - Yes.

177
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,130
From this point on do not miss a single move of Yi In Jwa.

178
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,690
Understand?

179
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,850
No.

180
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,610
We need to drill out a way to live, don't we?

181
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,150
His Highness Prince Yeoning has...

182
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,710
Oh, no, at such a young age.

183
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,250
His Highness Prince Yeonryeong has... aigoo

184
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,850
Have you heard about Prince Yeonryeong?

185
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,490
How could something like this happen to His Highness Prince Yeonryeong?

186
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,950
Prince Yeonryeong has passed. 
  (Jeong Hee Ryang) 

187
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,200
My Liege, are you really planning on plucking the Current Crown's neck?

188
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,680
The tree is already dead.

189
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,160
What kind of carving should be done on that dead tree?

190
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,460
It's not like a pile of dirt can support a crumbled wall.

191
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,530
I was just going to wait until he died naturally,

192
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:59,110
but he's persisting and spreading a rotten smell.

193
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,450
So there's no other option than for me to personally pull out the roots.

194
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,700
Postpone it for just a moment.

195
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,910
The king is due to draw his last breath, so put away your sword for the moment.

196
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,220
Prince Yeonryeong is dead?

197
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,170
They say it was caused by acute indigestion.

198
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,820
I checked directly myself, Your Majesty.

199
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,800
At least bring me his body.

200
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,150
Your Majesty, how can a corpse be brought into the Palace?

201
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,350
That is impossible.

202
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Since the Current Crown's life's thread is at its end, put away your sword...

203
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,360
Is that what all you wanted to tell me?

204
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,770
I, Jeong Hee Ryang,

205
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,280
will join your cause.

206
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,710
I'm saying that I too will participate in the bloodshed.

207
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,110
To become a King

208
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,700
is your personal desire. Have you abandoned it?

209
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,840
 Yi and Jeong, unite in aspiration. 

210
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,340
If you have indeed abandoned that desire,

211
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,200
then swear this blood oath.

212
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,740
This is mine.

213
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,780
In case there's an off-chance... let's keep each other's.

214
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,540
If an unpleasant circumstance were to come upon me

215
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,370
you are to take my blood oath

216
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,900
and seek my other half.

217
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,460
He will help you. 
 ( Park Pil Hyeon )

218
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,220
Then what do I need to give in return?

219
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,520
You don't need to give me anything.

220
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,980
You

221
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,600
abandon me.

222
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,670
 Hurry. 

223
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,980
Crown Prince.

224
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,170
I have something to say to you.

225
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,470
Crown Prince.

226
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,830
Why are you just covering up Prince Yeonryeong's death?

227
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,250
Our younger brother's sudden death. There are many aspects that are questionable.

228
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,910
Please transfer the case to the Police Bureau, and reveal the cause.

229
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,870
Did you not hear?

230
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,400
The cause of death was acute indigestion without any external injury, as I heard.

231
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,090
How are you so sure it was acute indigestion?

232
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,580
Is that your true feeling?

233
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,300
The Noron and Soron factions have unified on the issue,

234
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,030
so the cause of death must be acute indigestion,

235
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,810
even if it is just for you.

236
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,930
There is no benefit.

237
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,890
Revealing the death of His Highness Prince Yeonryeong,

238
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:06,330
does not benefit Your Highness in any way.

239
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,810
Who takes his brother's death

240
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,340
and calculates costs and benefits?

241
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,170
Your Highness.

242
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:18,050
Who would benefit from His Highness Prince Yeonryeong's death?

243
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,540
Do not say you guys ...

244
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,060
for me...

245
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,000
  Seeing that the Norons and Sorons have unified over the issue, 

246
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,750
 the cause of death must be acute indigestion. 

247
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,970
 For your own good. 

248
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,650
Whoever's hands were stained by blood,

249
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,970
Your Highness must reflect again, and reflect yet again,

250
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,030
waiting for an opportunity.

251
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,670
Opportunity?

252
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,450
Your Highness. This is a time of trials and tribulations.

253
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,520
As they say, bloodshed in the royal court will lead to flooding among the people.

254
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,610
Don't you know?

255
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,780
Your Highness should

256
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,440
focus only on what lies ahead.

257
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,950
Dae Gil, look over there.

258
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,440
 Aigoo, do you know what kind of object it is to me? 

259
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,840
 Aigoo! Let go! 

260
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,620
Sir! Please save us! Sir!

261
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,380
Aigoo! Look at that!

262
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,010
As soon as Prince Yeonryeong dies,

263
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,680
they are confiscating everything, saying they are royal assets.

264
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,710
  Prince Yeonryeong said they were so pitiable  

265
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,000
that he helped them out with more than a penny or two.

266
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,750
How will he live for now, if they take all of it!

267
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,340
Give it up!

268
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,970
Get away.

269
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,250
My Lord.

270
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,960
No.

271
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,330
 Hwon, 

272
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,500
 I am sorry. 

273
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,070
 There's nothing more I can do. 

274
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,310
Isn't this quite the example of wearing hemp over silk?

275
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,740
 "Wear hemp over silk": show the virtue of humility 

276
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,980
What brings you here?

277
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,220
Born as a prince, but just one house with only two or three household assistants.

278
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,210
The land and assets, all distributed to the people,

279
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,500
while he himself made his meals

280
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,190
of rice gruel and soy sauce.

281
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,560
Truly, it pains my heart.

282
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,330
Condolences like yours are not needed.

283
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,950
But I have something to say to you.

284
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,910
Since the one person who was the bloodline of the Three Jongs (heir to Kings Hyojong, Hyeonjong, and Sookjong) is dead,

285
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,370
there are only three people left.

286
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,260
The throne has come much closer to you now.

287
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,250
What are you saying?

288
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,470
There are three people in the Three-Jong bloodline for the throne?

289
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,320
I guess you still didn't know.

290
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,230
The Crown Prince and I,

291
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,300
who else is there?

292
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,430
There is one more person.

293
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,420
Do you think I would trust what you say?

294
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,960
Your deceptions.

295
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,980
It is someone you know very well.

296
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,090
What?

297
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,220
Very closely,

298
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,120
he is watching over you.

299
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,570
Such sickening words.

300
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,510
I can't listen to this anymore.

301
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,030
 No way, can it be...? 

302
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,630
  No, it can't be. 

303
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,680
  It isn't so. 

304
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,000
Come.

305
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
Next.

306
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,400
Come.

307
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,410
Father.

308
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,920
Yes, it's me.

309
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,390
Are you okay? Not hurt anywhere?

310
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,080
Don't forget what I said to you that day.

311
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,810
Your life belongs to the people.

312
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,710
Don't be careless with it no matter what, got that?

313
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,480
About that,

314
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,030
I need you to find out something for me.

315
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,710
Traitor Jeong. I must see him.

316
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,650
This, give me three.

317
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,070
Here.

318
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,250
Welcome.

319
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,390
When I heard that you were looking for me, I was hesitant to show myself,

320
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,760
whether I should go to you first

321
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,810
or I should wait.

322
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:44,800
Yi In Jwa was the culprit who killed Prince Yeonryeong.

323
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,270
Did you already know it?

324
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:54,690
Then do you also know Prince Yeoning is trying to cover up Prince Yeonryeong's death?

325
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,640
Why would Prince Yeoning do that? Do you think I will believe you?

326
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,340
King Sejo who ascended to the throne after killing Prince Nosan.

327
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:10,130
King Taejong, who ascended to the throne after killing his brothers during the two times of the wars among Princes.

328
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,360
The royal court is like that.

329
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,800
When a bloody wind blows through the court,

330
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,200
the citizens cry tears of blood.

331
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,470
If you draw a sword, you'll be a traitor.

332
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,710
If you don't do so, you become an animal.

333
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,990
Do you understand now?

334
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,850
The reason that treasonous coups never cease in this country.

335
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,710
Having a traitorous mind is for the good of the people?

336
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:00,610
You can see the people's bloody tears now.

337
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,690
Are you going to pour water into a jar with a cracked bottom,

338
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,630
or are you going to slash the rotten ministers' necks?

339
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,760
If I ally with you, what will change?

340
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,820
There is no one but you

341
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,020
who can start a rebellion and become king.

342
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,630
Tell me.  To become king, how many people do I have to kill?

343
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,760
Since you are of the King's bloodline,  it's not treason.

344
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,090
You are just taking back what was taken away from you.

345
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:45,210
Yi In Jwa and I can't. But for you,

346
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,600
I mean, you don't need to step on anybody else's corpse to ascend.

347
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:57,000
Are you confident that you can stand idly by and watch such a rotten and corrupt court?

348
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,930
If you ally with me,

349
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,890
I will give you Yi In Jwa's neck.

350
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,180
I'll await your answer.

351
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,780
 Yi In Jwa and I can't. But for you, 

352
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,670
 I mean, you don't need to step on anybody else's corpse to ascend. 

353
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,210
 Since the one person who was the bloodline of the Three Jongs (heirs to Kings Hyojong, Hyeonjong, and Sookjong) is dead, 

354
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,210
 there are only three people left. 

355
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,470
 He is someone you know very well. 

356
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,750
 He is watching over you 

357
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,590
 very closely. 

358
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,760
What's your reason for hiding the cause of death of Prince Yeonryeong?

359
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,940
It's Yi In Jwa. It's Yi In Jwa's doing.  Don't you know?

360
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,530
That's just a guess.

361
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,570
Do you have proof?

362
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,680
What?

363
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,990
Since Royal Father is in critical condition,

364
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,680
it is an urgent priority for the current royal court to stabilize the nation's affairs.

365
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,400
Though if it's sad—

366
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,750
Stop it!

367
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,890
Are all people of royalty like this? A brother has died; how can you be so calm?

368
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,850
What? Stabilizing the nation's affairs?

369
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,350
Doesn't human obligation come first?

370
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,190
Politics is

371
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,350
like that.

372
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,040
Do you know the weight of royalty and the royal court?

373
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,730
One by one for every single thing...

374
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,250
I have no room to be sad.

375
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,180
Tell me the truth. When your younger brother, who was blocking your way, died,

376
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,170
didn't you feel relieved to have shaken off this uncomfortable burden? Am I wrong?

377
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,950
Then, have you, without even the slightest lie,

378
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,050
been completely honest?

379
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,850
I have never lied. Not even once.

380
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,760
Who is your biological father?

381
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,740
Why aren't you saying anything?

382
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,870
You said you have never lied.

383
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,870
So tell me.

384
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,580
My father is only Baek Man Geum.

385
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,640
I asked

386
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,460
who is your biological father.

387
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,480
Then is it true that you met the traitor Jeong?

388
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:26,820
  Baek Dae Gil is probably meeting with the traitor Jeong now. 

389
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,830
Why did you hide...

390
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,460
that you are the son of Royal Father?

391
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,740
Why did you hide it? What was there to gain

392
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,370
that you have stayed by my side? Answer me!

393
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,880
Why is that important? Whether my father is the king or Baek Man Geum—

394
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,390
If I had known you were of the Royal Father's bloodline,

395
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,990
I would never have relaxed.

396
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:05,910
I would not have left you by my side.

397
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,300
I know now.

398
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,250
I know now, what the Great Cause Yi In Jwa  cried for so much is.

399
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,140
This country is so very rotten.

400
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,860
Your Highness is not so different from them.

401
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,990
I don't know who he is, but he's certainly of high rank.

402
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,800
What do you mean "of high rank"? He's just a thief.

403
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,590
It's certain someone must have done something to take back Prince Yeonryeong's assets.

404
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,480
Usually, the inspection of assets starts a half-month after the funeral.

405
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,000
Seeing that it is happening on the day of the funeral without inspection

406
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,530
means someone must have done something.

407
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,150
 Do you know the weight of royalty and the royal court? 

408
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,400
 One by one for every single thing... 

409
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,960
 I have no room to be sad. 

410
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,750
 Are you going to pour water into a jar with a cracked bottom? 

411
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,630
 Or are you going to slash the rotten ministers' necks? 

412
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,940
There's a place I need to go.

413
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,770
 How will people who lost their rice bowls (livelihoods) live? 

414
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,630
  They'll eat even plant roots in the mountains, won't they? 

415
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,870
 Move the stuff inside. 

416
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,850
 They gobble up all of them. 

417
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:56,570
  Grains, assets, everything... 

418
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,150
 Originally, Prince Yeonryeong's assets belonged to the government. 

419
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,470
  It's not against the national law. 

420
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,580
Is it lawlessness or law?

421
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,270
Knocking the people down?

422
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,960
What kind of a national law is it?

423
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,890
I... will ally with the traitor Jeong.

424
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,600
You all have clearly seen this country is getting corrupt.

425
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,900
There are always such corrupt rotten people, no matter what.

426
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,680
Why are you trying to step forward? Why you?

427
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,020
Why do the commoners suffer the difficulty every time?

428
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,050
The corrupt rotten nobles eat well and live well.

429
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,880
But why are the commoners downtrodden and forced to suffer every time?

430
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,120
Because we don't have power.

431
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,350
The commoners don't have power.

432
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,310
So although we know it,

433
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,480
just pretend not to know. I can't do that.

434
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,690
Did you bring your answer?

435
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,260
First, you cut off Yi In Jwa.

436
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,370
If I do it,

437
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,600
what are you going to show me?

438
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,050
What you have desired so much...

439
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,750
I'll become the King.

440
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,900
I'm saying I'll become the King.

441
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,370
Are you serious?

442
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,440
Wait and see whether I'm serious or not.

443
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,510
Follow me.

444
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,700
Come in.

445
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,600
Greet him.

446
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,380
You all may leave.

447
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,320
Yes.

448
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,740
Every day, all the information from inside and outside the palace

449
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,160
is collected here.

450
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,640
Is that all you want to show me?

451
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,520
Tonight at Haeshi (9–11 pm), we'll have a big business transaction.

452
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,380
At Haeshi?

453
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:23,180
You said you'd join the thorny path toward the Great Cause. So show us your sincerity.

454
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,460
You do this transaction yourself.

455
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,660
Me?

456
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,450
Are you afraid to soil your hands?

457
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:45,250
Indeed, if something goes wrong, you won't be safe either.

458
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,960
Since you've boarded the same boat, you should row too.

459
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,640
One hundred nyangs as promised.

460
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,320
Take it as soon as possible.

461
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,980
Hey. You have to work as much as you get paid.

462
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,580
What?

463
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,500
Show us the goods yourself.

464
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,380
Done?

465
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,280
No, not yet.

466
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,540
We have to return them to their original owners.

467
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,560
You are not the owner of these goods.

468
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,520
They belong to the people.

469
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,480
What are you doing not sweeping them away immediately!

470
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,640
Halt!

471
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,340
Kim Che Geon.

472
00:44:53,340 --> 00:45:01,040
I came here to take your traitor's neck that I couldn't take during the treason in the year of Jeongchoon.

473
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,800
You! Drop your swords.

474
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:59,140
  The fellow, Jeong Hee Ryang wrote a blood oath with Yi In Jwa. Didn't you know about it? 

475
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,580
 Why are you telling me that? 

476
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,860
 I have to find the way to survive, too. 

477
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,800
 If I have to, I'd rather choose to hold the strong rope. 

478
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,700
 The person who got Prince Yeonryeong's assets and stuff returned 

479
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,380
 is Jeong Hee Ryang. I'm certain about it. 

480
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,040
 Even the rice in the government stores that was saved for the meager springtime, 

481
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,160
 and people's bloody money are involved, too. 

482
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,460
How?

483
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:45,280
I wasn't originally interested in being King, nor in being a traitor either.

484
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:52,400
It's my crime and my mistake. The guy who lacked the capacity of King from the start—

485
00:46:52,400 --> 00:47:00,020
Listen to me carefully. I, Baek Dae Gil, have only one great cause in my heart:

486
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:07,540
to make those holding weapons take up sickles and hoes.

487
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,440
Make a nation be like a nation, and the people be like people.

488
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,540
Shut up!

489
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,040
I saw apprehension in your eyes.

490
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,540
I can't stain your hands with dirty blood.

491
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,020
You've worked hard coming all the way here.

492
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,740
Aigoo. Sir!

493
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:27,750
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

494
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,940
I told Prince Yeoning.

495
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,820
Is that it?

496
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:57,280
You caught the traitor Jeong in the act and even got clear evidence

497
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,500
Royal Father will be really impressed with you.

498
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,920
It's not for the King.

499
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,340
Acting for the sake of the people is the king's duty.

500
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,040
What are you looking for?

501
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,540
Evidence of the conspiracy with Yi In Jwa.

502
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:33,860
From start to finish, my goal is Yi In Jwa.

503
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,310

504
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,510
The blood oath! What happened to the blood oath?

505
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,850
It seems that they couldn't find the blood oath.

506
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,080
Find it.

507
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,550
Find the blood oath this instant!

508
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,740
Baek Dae Gil

509
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,820
arrested the traitor Jeong, you're saying?

510
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,410
Yes, Royal Father.

511
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:47,670
That punk fulfilled my longtime wish.

512
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,070
Summon him.

513
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:08,490
How do you plan to lead your life in the future?

514
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,540
Are you going to keep living as a gambler in the streets?

515
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,830
May I speak honestly to you?

516
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,730
I want to receive

517
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,500
the compensation for all the pains of enduring

518
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,690
the brutal and bumpy past times.

519
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,070
However, regardless of Your Majesty or His Highness the Prince,

520
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:48,190
I'll live a life rewarding myself in my own way

521
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,980
as this nation's subject, Baek Dae Gil.

522
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:01,900
Come closer.

523
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,380
Yes. Your Majesty.

524
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,690
Yeong Soo.

525
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,440
Yes. Your Majesty.

526
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,320
The elder brother should be like the elder brother,

527
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,590
The younger brother should be like the younger brother. That's the way it is.

528
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:51,350
That is a basic moral obligation which holds the world up.

529
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,730
Impress it deep in your mind.

530
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,730
Yes. Your Majesty.

531
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,430
Should I be a subject?

532
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,770
Or be an elder brother?

533
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,190
His Highness the Crown Prince is coming!

534
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,370
I heard you arrested the traitor Jeong.

535
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,360
Yes. Your Highness.

536
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,690
Then I'll take my leave.

537
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,900
If you ascend to the throne,—

538
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,570
Your Majesty. What nonsense are you speaking.

539
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,210
Hear me out.

540
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,270
If you become a King, like this,

541
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,850
if you, who have no heir, become a King as you are,

542
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:55,850
without any doubt, the Norons will attempt to enthrone Prince Yeoning.

543
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:00,060
What are you going to do with Prince Yeoning?

544
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:06,980
Will you let Prince Yeoning live or be killed?

545
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,710
That's what I am asking.

546
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:16,970
The fate of a Prince is

547
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,020
to win the war among the princes in order to survive.

548
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:25,210
The fate of a King

549
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,300
starts when his father the King passes away. That's the way it is.

550
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,550
Answer quickly.

551
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,830
Baek Dae Gil.

552
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,150
With that child,

553
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:56,800
you can't make him a foe or an ally.

554
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:03,620
Just as a broken roof tile can't ward off the rain.

555
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,910
Since he has a different path,

556
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:12,110
just accept each other's fate.

557
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,740
I'll keep it in mind.

558
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:20,180
Before I go,

559
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,700
I'm planning on opening a way for you to survive.

560
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:32,890
Therefore, always behave neatly and smartly.

561
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,690
Someday, the person who'll sit on the throne,

562
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,160
and engrave this nation Joseon in posterity

563
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,600
will be you.

564
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,310
Really,

565
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,600
life is a moment.

566
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,680
 Your Majesty the King, please come back! 
 (The King passed away.) 

567
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,130
 Your Majesty the King, please come back! 

568
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:37,600
 King, please come back! 

569
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:43,180
 Your Majesty the King, please come back!  

570
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:47,320
 Your Majesty the King, please come back!  

571
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,780
 Your Majesty the King, please come back!  

572
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:58,990
♬  Will I be able to see when time stops?  ♬

573
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:09,920
♬  Will your heart be by my side then?  ♬

574
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,600
♬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  ♬

575
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,570
  Appoint the Crown Prince Yi Yoon to be the new King. 

576
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:22,830
 I'll install Prince Yeoning as the Crown Prince. 

577
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,080
 Let's take this opportunity to push it to the regent. 

578
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,050
 Do I really not look like the King in your eyes? 

579
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,220
 Where is the blood oath that Jeong left with you? 

580
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,300
 I don't need the gambling den or anything, 

581
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,620
 so let's go to the end! 

582
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,200
 Yi In Jwa is scheming something. 

583
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,650
 - I'll  assist the Crown Prince. 
 - The palace atmosphere is amiss. 

584
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:42,850
f  Right now, arrest all the Noron ministers who joined in the treason! 

585
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,880
 What kind of trick is this? 

586
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,860
 What are you doing 

587
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,250
 not arresting the special cavalry officer?
