 Episode 21 

2
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,430
Baek Dae Gil, what on earth is your intention?

3
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,120
You cast away Yi In Jwa and cast me away.

4
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,390
After all that, you try to put that bastard up as King?

5
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,790
That's an absolutely unreasonable remark.

6
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,050
If not, since you are the royal bloodline of the Three Jongs,

7
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,450
do you think I'd spare the lives of you two brothers?
 Gyeongjong, 20th King of Joseon 

8
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,550
 Crown Prince Yi Geom (later Yeoning) 

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,430
Did you think I didn't know?

10
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,480
Today, I'll cut off these tiresome and disgusting ties.

11
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,900
Move aside!

12
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,050
The late King expressed his dying wish to me.

13
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,050
"Norons won't acknowledge the Crown Prince as a King."

14
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,620
"It'll be certain that as the Sorons gain power, a bloody purge of the ministries will follow."

15
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,940
"At that time, you have to save Prince Yeoning's life. I said to save your younger brother's life."

16
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,530
So, I answered, "Yes, Your Majesty."

17
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,080
"Your humble subject will protect Prince Yeoning's life."

18
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,360
"As his older brother, I'll sacrifice my life to protect his." That's how I answered.

19
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,980
Did Royal Father

20
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,210
leave a will to save that traitor?

21
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,620
Eunuchs!

22
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,860
Is all that he is saying true?

23
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes. Your Majesty.

24
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,310
Royal Father saves your life.

25
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,940
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

26
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,860
However, this is only the time I'll forgive you.

27
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:14,140
Also, I will definitely not forgive all the Noron ministers

28
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,730
who don't acknowledge me as a King, so I'll punish all of them by beheading.

29
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,570
Your Majesty.

30
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,070
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,960
With that, you, Crown Prince,  cherish your life

32
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,900
and stay out of governmental affairs from now on. Do you understand?

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,380
What are you doing?

34
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,260
What should I do?

35
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,390
For the Norons' lives.

36
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,400
How can I save them?

37
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,230
Your humble subject will find a way to save them, so don't act rashly.

38
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,160
Can you understand?

39
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,600
- You, bastards! 
 - You still don't know what's going on?

40
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,490
Your Majesty!
 Kim Chang Jip 

41
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,810
Here. 
  (Yi In Jwa) 

42
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,250
 Jo Il Soo, Choi Yi Seok 

43
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,570
 Kim Il Gyeong 

44
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,550
 The evidence? 

45
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,310
That's the blood oath between the traitor Jeong and  Yi In Jwa.

46
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,620
Your Majesty, the person who plotted treason, the person who incited the Norons to install the Crown Prince,

47
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,030
the person who showed his contempt for Your Majesty by sending an assassin to your bedroom and poisoning your food,

48
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,130
the person who looked down on Your Majesty and tempted the royal court,

49
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,260
the one who has done all that is Yi In Jwa. Therefore, pardon the Noron ministers' offenses,

50
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,690
and punish the traitor Yi In Jwa by beheading.

51
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:09,060
If Yi In Jwa is a traitor, I can punish him by beheading as well.

52
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,510
But that can not overcome the fact the Noron ministers held traitorous thoughts.

53
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,680
Your Majesty. From the beginning, the installation of the Crown Prince and the regency—

54
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,590
Do you want to insist that it is Yi In Jwa's scheme?

55
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,570
The Noron ministers are not Yi In Jwa's puppets.

56
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,770
Also, it is not important whether the treason existed or not.

57
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:43,670
The important thing is they had a traitorous intent in their minds.

58
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,070
The fact they have never acknowledged me as a King

59
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,070
is the reason they must die.

60
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,110
However, Your Majesty—

61
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,920
I won't repeat myself.

62
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,250
Noron ministers and Yi In Jwa,

63
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,840
I'll punish them on my own.

64
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,740
What happens to them?

65
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:27,050
I couldn't prevent the Noron ministers from being executed.

66
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,350
 Jo Tae Chae, Yi Geon Myeong, Yi Yi Myeong, Kim Chang Jip 

67
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,650
 Kim Che Geon 

68
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,780
Your Majesty! Punish me, and save the Noron ministers in exchange.

69
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:49,300
Take your younger brother's life and spare the ministers' lives, Your Majesty.

70
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,770
Did you do that?

71
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,980
I asked you whether you committed the crime  of controlling the Noron ministers from behind

72
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,880
in order to dethrone me, pushing me into being a puppet king,

73
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,210
looking down on me and humiliating me.

74
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:14,660
Your Majesty, that is the Noron ministers' misdirected loyalty.

75
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,670
Then why do you side with the traitors who deserve to die?

76
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,660
Your Majesty, please.

77
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:31,050
I don't  have the slightest intention of pardoning traitors who held traitorous thoughts.

78
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,570
Even if one is my younger brother.

79
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,500
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

80
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,510
 Kim Chang Jip 

81
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,530
Make way!

82
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,910
Your Highness!

83
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,540
Make way!

84
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,750
Acting  for the sake of the royal family and the whole nation,

85
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,550
how do they call that disloyalty and treason?

86
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:41,150
 This Kim Chang Jip will  keep his promise to Her Highness by all means. 

87
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,860
 My Excellency. 

88
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,330
 Your Highness, please trust this Kim Chang Jip. 

89
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,970
My Excellency.

90
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,840
Your Highness! Conserve yourself to the end,

91
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:04,330
restore the foundation of this wavering nation!

92
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,280
Stop.

93
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,980
Halt!  Halt!  Halt!

94
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,270
Halt! I told you to halt!

95
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,410
Move!

96
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,830
Move, move! I said move!

97
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,140
If you move forward more from here, you'll get hurt.

98
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,140
They can't die.

99
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,020
What in the world kind of crimes did they commit?

100
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,960
What kind of crimes?!

101
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,890
What kind of crimes for them?!

102
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,970
I'm sorry.

103
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,370
I must...

104
00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:00,050
 I'll definitely get revenge for your resentments. 

105
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,250
Trust me.

106
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,190
Please wait.

107
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,280
I'm sorry.

108
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,150
 In 1722, Shin Yim Literati Purges 

109
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,590
Leave me alone.

110
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,620
I told you to leave me alone. Please.

111
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,940
Please leave me alone.

112
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,600
Royal Mother.

113
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,910
Right now, I...

114
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,730
What should I do?

115
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,270
 Royal Father. 

116
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,920
 I don't want to lose... 

117
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,720
 My people. I don't want to lose them anymore. 

118
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,750
Dae Gil.

119
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,050
Are you okay?

120
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,210
How about His Highness?

121
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,360
You should stay next to him.

122
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,340
Why did you come home? He must've been really shocked.

123
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,320
There is nothing I can do for him.

124
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,680
 Blood oath. 

125
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,970
Were you looking for me, Your Majesty?

126
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,440
Tell me.

127
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,150
What can I do with the Crown Prince?

128
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:30,140
If you don't root out the seed of the treason, the seed will revive again at any time.

129
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,830
Please take his life.

130
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,650
More than a hundred Noron ministers have been killed

131
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,830
with your one word.

132
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,760
You must have persuaded the Noron ministers.

133
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,800
You incited them, so you drove them to their deaths.

134
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,090
No, it's not true, Your Majesty. What kind of power do I have to make the Noron ministers act?

135
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,900
Then, regarding me, what kind of power do you have to make me act?

136
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,390
Am I lighter than the ministers... for you?

137
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,280
The evidence!

138
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,190
 This is it? 

139
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,940
Are you going to say that you didn't take this blood oath?

140
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,150
Your Majesty.

141
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,080
- Your Highness. 
 - Go back.

142
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:58,680
Right now... I don't want to meet anybody.

143
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,350
I'm telling you I don't want to hear anything.

144
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,990
His Majesty made a courageous decision.

145
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,970
His Majesty will abandon Yi In Jwa.

146
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,010
Your Majesty, I have never plotted treason.

147
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,400
Are you going to deny it  in front of this blood oath?

148
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,820
Your Majesty, it's true that I wrote this blood oath.

149
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,020
However, everything

150
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,960
is my planned measure for making you accede to the throne.

151
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,410
Your Majesty. Have you already forgotten?

152
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:54,310
During your Crown Prince period, how did the  late King and Noron ministers treat you?

153
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,700
And how did Prince Yeoning act toward you?

154
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,930
They treated you coldly,  left you out,

155
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,060
and threatened you, didn't they?

156
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,980
The pledge that I gave to you in the past,

157
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,250
this humble subject has kept it my in my heart.

158
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,560
 Your Highness should sit on the throne. 

159
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,930
 For me, I'll accept only your feelings. 

160
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,300
All these things are for your sake and your power.

161
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,670
Don't you really know all these things came from my loyalty to you?

162
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,870
Your loyalty.

163
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,400
It's not like I don't know it.

164
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,430
I can't forget it either.

165
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,980
However, as you said, it's natural that the root of treason can revive at anytime.

166
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,140
In return for my sparing your life,

167
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,500
you should never even set foot in the palace again,

168
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,790
and you should lay down everything you have.

169
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,990
Your Majesty, it would be better if you cut my throat.

170
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,420
I beg you not to meddle with the affairs of state anymore.

171
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,970
Your Majesty!

172
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,860
Traitor Jeong will be beheaded tomorrow.

173
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,420
 Though it is a hard-earned card that was won through patience over time, 

174
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:18,260
 must it be discarded so easily... so pointlessly? 

175
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,250
A dull knife must be thrown away.

176
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,730
The Noron ministers have been eliminated without a trace 
  (Choi Yi Seok, Associate Left Minister) 

177
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,430
now that even the King's favor has been taken away.

178
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,250
As for a knife which is no longer of any use, there is no need to carry it. 
  (Jo Il Soo, Associate Right Minister) 

179
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,540
Are your excellencies also planning on turning your backs on me?

180
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,810
You have allied yourself with Traitor Jeong.

181
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,540
I heard that you wrote a blood oath.

182
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,400
Go back, we have no need to see you anymore.

183
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,870
You will throw me away...

184
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,450
Are you so confident you'll be unwavering in your decision?

185
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,440
Are you trying to intimidate us by force?

186
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,350
You're the King's teacher, so that's why we shared a friendship with you all this time.

187
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,250
How can we maintain a relationship with you, who allied with the traitor?

188
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,650
Get out of here.

189
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,640
From this point, he will lose everything.

190
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,980
His Majesty the King told him that everything Yi In Jwa owns—

191
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,870
So,

192
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,120
will anything change?

193
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,650
After so long a time,  even if Yi In Jwa

194
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,630
is thrown away,

195
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,140
will those who have been sacrificed, due to his schemes, come back to life or something?

196
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,880
 Jeong Hee Ryang 

197
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,400
It's been a while, Young Master Jeong.

198
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,420
Have you... changed your mind now?

199
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,930
Indeed, they say that a man  who dies after eating looks better than a man who starves to death.

200
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,210
They say you'll be beheaded tomorrow.

201
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,980
No matter how I think about it, you need to die in order for me to live.

202
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:15,120
Even though the flesh decays and turns to a handful of dirt,  the soul is immortal.

203
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,990
 Hey! Look! What happened to you? 

204
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,560
What happened!

205
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,100
You must rise up from this.

206
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,560
For the sake of those who lost their lives for you, you must get up!

207
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:10,380
Your Highness, Traitor Jeong and his subordinates have taken poison and committed suicide.

208
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,900
I heard that all the criminals have died.

209
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:47,360
Doesn't that mean that your plan to catch whoever was behind Traitor Jeong by keeping him alive has gone awry?

210
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,590
Not yet.

211
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,050
Now is the time for the true battle. So as for Your Majesty,

212
00:25:55,050 --> 00:26:01,950
using the Royal Investigative Bureau, Office of the Inspector General, Police Bureau, and the Capital Bureau, tie up Yi In Jwa's neck.

213
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,550
Sa Woon, Sa Mo.

214
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,270
The Current Crown has turned away from you, My  Liege?

215
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,290
I mean... how? What is the reason?

216
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,770
The Current Crown has possession of the blood oath between me and Young Master Jeong.

217
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,300
 Hwang Jin Gi 

218
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,180
The blood oath most definitely—

219
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:35,400
The one burned by Boss Hong... was probably fake.

220
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,400
The real oath was probably turned over to Baek Dae Gil.

221
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,090
But it doesn't matter.

222
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,490
It's just that time has gotten ahead of itself a bit. The Crown Prince was a card that was to be disposed of anyhow.

223
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,960
- Confiscate everything!  
 - Yes.

224
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,750
What's the matter?

225
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,950
Please excuse me, it's the King's command.

226
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,750
King's command?

227
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,680
 You will have to give up everything. 

228
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,260
Left Police Bureau Deputy Inspector, you are making a huge mistake...

229
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,410
I've come from the Capital Bureau to conduct an investigation.

230
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,040
I guess we're late to the party. I'm from the Office of the Inspector General, Scholar Sire Yi In Jwa.

231
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,500
What?

232
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:01,970
Tomorrow, you should come willingly to the Royal Investigation Bureau, before the arrest warrant is issued.

233
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,100
Sire, what shall we do now?

234
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:24,320
It seems the Current Crown has resolved to kill me.

235
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,100
He will die anyhow... so I wanted to use him a little more.

236
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,470
If that's how he chooses to move, then there's no option but for me to cut him down.

237
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,980
What are you thinking of doing?

238
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:46,100
In case of the off chance, I already had something done.

239
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,650
 Park Pil Hyeon 

240
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,300
Are you Yi In Jwa's other half, Park Pil Hyeon?

241
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,800
I'm Jeong Hee Ryang of Yeongnam. I have written a blood oath with your sworn brother Yi In Jwa.

242
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:58,450
If we miss the proper timing, we will both miss opportunities. So decide.

243
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,800
Brother has finally drawn his sword.

244
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,250
Tell your comrades

245
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,890
that tomorrow at noon, I, Park Pil Hyeon, will lead a charge against the enemy at the capital.

246
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,670
Yes.

247
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,450
Anyhow, the capital will be in an uproar tomorrow.

248
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,560
Are you sure Yi In Jwa will move?

249
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,420
He'll move.

250
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,980
Otherwise, he'll be put to death sitting still.

251
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,110
Your Highness, you should have  some...

252
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,210
Your Highness.

253
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:31,230
I'll slash the King's neck and open a new world.

254
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,550
 King,  

255
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:48,450
 the favors I have done for you during my past time,  

256
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,850
 I'll take them all back today. 

257
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,860
Who are you?

258
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,740
I'm called Yi In Jwa.

259
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,970
If you're called Yi In Jwa...

260
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,830
Well, what brings you here?

261
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,980
It has really been a very long time.

262
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,210
At this time, what is this sound of a bell being struck?

263
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,930
I'll check and come back.

264
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,560
How come I hear the sound of the bell being struck at this hour?

265
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:04,550
 First the sound of the bell being struck five times. Then it sounded nine times. 

266
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,850
 The fifth letter of the heavens is... "Mu." 

267
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,450
 The ninth letter of the earth's branches is... "Shin." 

268
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,450
 Mu Shin. 
 ("military coup") 

269
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,370
 Mu Shin 

270
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,010
Mu Shin.

271
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,110
Right now,

272
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,470
how many times was the bell struck?

273
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,950
Pardon?

274
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,450
Everybody! Get up!

275
00:34:54,450 --> 00:35:01,950
The nation for the people and by the people is before us.

276
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,060
 People whose clans have been ruined three times by past changes in government. 

277
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,460
 People who have struggled in pain from a disaster that wiped out a whole family. 

278
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,120
 People who have shed tears of blood for being scorned by the rotten royal court 

279
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,540
  All of you, get up and open a new world together! 

280
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:43,590
It's a royal order. Right now, arrest all the officials of the Six Ministries and Three Offices.

281
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,760
Is this it?

282
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,470
I mean,  are they all of the traitors you've planted in the palace?

283
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,130
How did you find out?

284
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:21,160
I expected there were the traitors in the palace but I wasn't completely sure.

285
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,670
How did you move all of them at the same time?

286
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,380
But,

287
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,420
I was convinced after hearing the sound of bell you struck.

288
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,690
Then... all of them...

289
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,360
What are you doing? Arrest him!

290
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,150
Now, it's over! Yi In Jwa.

291
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:12,040
I really wished... you'd become king.

292
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,550
I heard you could read the forces of heaven and earth and foresee the future.

293
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,150
You couldn't see my face well.

294
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,350
Where on earth did you see my face and tell me my countenance would become king?

295
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,300
Really, do you want to die by my hands?

296
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,930
Can you do that?

297
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,750
 Halt! 

298
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,680
I saw very well... your traitorous mind in your heart.

299
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,050
Your Majesty. You've deeply misunderstood.

300
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:11,500
What did I do? Are you speaking without evidence?

301
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,540
Evidence!

302
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:36,860
Why? Do you want to give more justification?

303
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,810
  King, it's not over, yet. 

304
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,350
 There will be no interrogation. 

305
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:54,900
 Show this traitor's face to all the people and behead him at sunset. 

306
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,530
 And hang his head where everyone can see it. 

307
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,810
  Make sure the seed of treason never takes root in the ground again. 

308
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,710
Traitor? Is he a traitor?

309
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,540
Aigoo! That, that bastard.

310
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,930
Is this bastard a traitor bastard?

311
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,510
Aigoo! You look very normal but you didn't have anything to do, so that's why you incited rebellion?

312
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,050
You deserve to be beaten to death, bastard!

313
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,660
Just take out his asshole!

314
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,000
Anyhow, his life is on the way to the afterworld.

315
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,410
Even if we destroy him now, that's not enough.

316
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,090
- Is it right? 
 - That's right!

317
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,840
  Th-that bastard. 

318
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,890
He is the bastard who sucked all of the pitiful people's money.

319
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,470
Yi In Jwa.

320
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:08,010
Baek Dae Gil, it would have been better if you'd slashed my neck. How can you humiliate me like this?

321
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,750
How can you dare... do this to Yi In Jwa?

322
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,650
It must be really humiliating.

323
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,960
However, why do you think His Majesty makes you stand here?

324
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,880
It's in order to let the rest of traitors confirm

325
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,320
your downfall.

326
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,390
That's how they won't have traitorous minds anymore.

327
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,960
What in the world and how much do you know?

328
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,670
Clansman Park from Honam Region.

329
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,940
How did you know...

330
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,950
What do you think my father has been doing until now, leaving his son alone?

331
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,450
What in the world has Baek Man Geum done?

332
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:05,250
I have known all along that Jeong Hee Ryang didn't die.

333
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,760
 You must have used a drug that temporarily makes the pulse faint. 

334
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,170
 We left him alone purposely so the cornered rat could  go to the rathole. 

335
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,940
  He will never be able to set foot in the capital. 

336
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,930
Well, let's see after sunset.

337
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,970
I give you all the credit for this.

338
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,490
In the palace, bloodshed has never ceased.

339
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,220
I don't have much time left in this life.

340
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,770
Since the improvement of the sickness is insignificant,

341
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:35,550
I added rehmannia glutinosa and wolfiporia extensa  (two medicinal herbs)  to strengthen your heart .

342
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,720
How much time do I have?

343
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,890
Your Majesty. How could you say that?

344
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,950
I have not been sick only for one or two days. I already knew it.

345
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,510
Tell me,

346
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,540
how much time do I have left?

347
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,960
Th-Th...

348
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,810
Since his Majesty has originally a weak character,

349
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,850
in the end, he'll hold Crown Prince Yeoning in his arms again.

350
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,800
In truth, he doesn't even have an heir.

351
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,900
He probably doesn't have any alternative...

352
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,370
So he can't cast Crown Prince Yeoning away completely.

353
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,360
Huh? In this way, is it possible we'll lose our heads as well?

354
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,780
We have to do something before that happens.

355
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,950
Even though the foundation of  the royal family and the nation is wavering,

356
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:57,750
I will never sit still and watch lowborn blood from a water maid ascend to the throne.

357
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,920
Aihee! Let's go.

358
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,940
 What happened to Park and Jeong? 

359
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,870
 Luckily, they diverted themselves. 

360
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,160
 Will the Great Cause be doomed to failure like this? 

361
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,920
 Find a horse and bring it. 

362
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,240
- Your Highness.  
  - Don't worry.

363
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:07,450
I won't let myself lie low the way they want.

364
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,890
Your Highness! Your Highness!

365
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,970
Your Highness! Your Highness!

366
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,370
It's not a poison.  However, if in a weak stomach,

367
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,180
you eat the raw daylily's leaves the wrong way,

368
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,510
you may lose your life in a serious case.

369
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:02,130
- I can't die like this. 
 - Your Majesty,

370
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,650
you should lie down more.

371
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,280
I have to see His Majesty.

372
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,200
What happened to those bastards?

373
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:19,350
Both Park Pil Hyeon and Jeong Hee Ryang  might've sensed  it, so they had already fled when we got there.

374
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,430
The soldiers will chase us with their eyes wide open.

375
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:35,150
All four major gates are blocked, so I'll slip out of here through Mount Nak.

376
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:40,470
In fact, it's said the light is weakest at the base of the candle...
 (the truth is hardest to see right under your nose) 

377
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:46,010
Well, be safe.

378
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:06,550
The execution of Yi In Jwa must be carried out without fail.

379
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,500
Save me, Your Majesty.

380
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,710
The Soron ministers have banded together to try to kill me.

381
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,680
I believe so.

382
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,880
The Noron ministers who followed you tried to kill even me, the King.

383
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,530
You are only a mere Crown Prince.

384
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:31,900
It's enough for them to throw you away.

385
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,860
Please stop them, Your Majesty.

386
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,900
You are the only one who can stop the Sorons.

387
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,260
I too

388
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,750
have no way to prevent the Sorons from doing that.

389
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,420
Then

390
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,850
do you mean I am just supposed let them take me in?

391
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:12,050
  I can't die like this. 

392
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:27,790
The wind is cold. Let's go inside the quarters.

393
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,150
How is it?

394
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,150
It's beautiful.

395
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,070
Is it so? For me, it seems sad.

396
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,340
If the sun sets below the horizon,

397
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,270
it disappears without any trace.

398
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,170
It'll be vain and despondent. 
   (Queen Seonui, King Gyeongjong's second queen) 

399
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:59,810
I am worried about you, who will be left alone without an heir.

400
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,620
Your Majesty.

401
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:07,120
How can you stop the sun from setting?

402
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,510
You must remain firm in your resolve.

403
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,350
As long as I remain seated on the throne,

404
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,690
I'm the people's.

405
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,690
Making a long-range plan for the royal family and the nation

406
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,110
is also my destiny.

407
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,390
So...

408
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,110
Towards you, I'm very...

409
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,930
sorry.

410
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,640
What are you planning to do after Yi In Jwa dies?

411
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,470
I must see him die first, and then make a decision.

412
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:11,270
 Search! Search! 

413
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:14,170
 Search! 

414
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,520
 Catch him! 

415
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:23,250
Please go ahead.  I'll hold them off from behind.

416
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,810
Well, I'll see you again.

417
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,570
You came?

418
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,820
You go ahead.

419
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,260
 - Catch him! 
  - Catch him! 

420
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,730
My Liege!

421
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:46,350
Over there! It's over there! That way!

422
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,570
 Over there! He's getting away! 

423
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:01,100
Lend me an arrow.

424
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,870
 Yi In Jwa, at the very least, I can't leave you alive. 

425
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,110
No matter how much you struggle, at the end is hell.

426
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,170
Then...

427
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,390
I'll see you in hell, Kim Che Geon.

428
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,130
Halt!

429
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:04,390
 Go to hell at last, Yi In Jwa! 

430
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:35,320
My Lord.

431
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,130
Check the dead body!

432
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,010
Yes!

433
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,000
What happened?

434
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,860
As for Hwang Jin Gi, at the edge of the cliff, he chose suicide.

435
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,970
Your Majesty.

436
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,540
I heard that for two days...

437
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,920
you've been unable to eat.

438
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,600
Bring it in.

439
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,580
 Have you made up your mind? 

440
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,720
I will summon the Tasting Court Lady.

441
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,060
No.

442
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,420
Take your leave.

443
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,500
Geum,

444
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:14,070
I'm sorry.

445
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,530
 Forgiveness... 

446
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,640
 I, your little brother, will ask for it. 

447
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,090
 Your Majesty. 

448
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:39,000
Your Majesty!

449
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Your Majesty!

450
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,030

 Like a rat, live forever hidden. 

456
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,580
 I won't be looked down upon again because I'm of lowborn blood from a water maid. 

457
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,100
 I don't want to see your face anymore, so I will order a beheading. 

458
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,510
 - You want us all to leave together? 
 - You'll find out when you get there, Elder. 

459
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:31,800
 Are you ready? 

460
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,270
 Leader Bong has taken the Cheongju Fortress! 

461
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:37,530
 We'll support Prince Milpung, Yi Tan to the throne. 

462
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,490
  Raising an army of as many as 200,000... 

463
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,650
  How can we block so many—  

464
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,710
 It's possible. Our goal is to hold back Yi In Jwa within three days. 

465
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,920
 Traitor Yi In Jwa and his gangs... 

466
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,740
 Massacre all of them to the last man.
