00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,100
 Episode 2 

2
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,080
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki 

3
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,200
It's six cups.

4
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,300
There were definitely seven... seven seven cups.

5
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,250
You probably accounted for the number of drinks you and I had just shared.

6
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,600
This is not new liquor.

7
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,070
These are bottles that had just been drunk from and left over.

8
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,200
As promised,

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,950
your wife is now, from this moment on, mine.

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,690
Imja.
 ("You," with a slightly intimate feeling. It could also be a term used for one's wife or a female acquaintance) 

11
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,100
Lord! Lord!

12
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,680
Why are you being like this?

13
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,670
She met such a person wretched as myself, so she's only suffered all her life.

14
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,290
If she's to be sold like this, what can be done about her pitiful life?

15
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,320
Well, for your wife, isn't it better for her

16
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,920
to be with me than with a gambler like you?

17
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,160
Am I wrong?

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,190
Sir, did you enjoy yourself?

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,570
Mm-hm. Yes, thanks to you.

20
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,080
Lord! Lord! One more time!

21
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,030
Play with me more time!

22
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,580
Anyway,

23
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,050
though the game was set up for you, you couldn't win a single round and ended up with empty pockets.

24
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,020
Sister! Something went wrong!

25
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,370
Wrong? What do you mean something went wrong?

26
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,000
Hey, I think this brother needs some work done on him.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,820
Sir!!

28
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,320
Bok Soon.

29
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,570
Bok Soon.

30
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,560
Do you think your sniveling and crying will bring your wife  back?

31
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,940
Do you even know who tried to fool you?

32
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,270
I was told he is just  a merchant...

33
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,210
l-lied?

34
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,500
That...

35
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,360
I was fooled by t-that pushover?!

36
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,350
That pushover is the king of this country.

37
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,460
K-king?? What nonsense are you—

38
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,450
I wonder how such a pretty water maid caught the eye of the current crown.

39
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,830
All this was planned by the king in order to take your wife.

40
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,200
Damn it.

41
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,740
YOUR MAJESTY!

42
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,390
Please return my wife to me!!

43
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,710
Your Majesty!! Return

44
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,320
my wife to me!!

45
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,330
YOUR MAJESTY! YOUR MAJESTY!

46
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,000
You are now mine, the king's woman.

47
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,460
You will have to do your best as a loyal subject.

48
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,470
Your Majesty.

49
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,060
Didn't you say that you wouldn't say two different things with the same mouth?

50
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,710
However, Your Majesty,

51
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,330
that game must be unfair.

52
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,900
It was unfair...?

53
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,940
I could kill you right now.

54
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,330
Without my wife, it's like being the living dead.

55
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,610
So,

56
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,930
even knowing that I am the king, you are willingly making a bet with me

57
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,590
with your unworthy life.

58
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,710
Yes, Your Majesty. I will wager my wife,

59
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,330
this gambler, Baek Man Geum's life, and my pride as a man.

60
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,350
I will put on everything on the line for this one gamble.

61
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,060
Then this will be the last bet you will ever make.

62
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,490
Keep in mind. If you do not acknowledge the outcome of the game this round

63
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,190
then I will be rid of your unworthy life

64
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,990
without even the birds or rats knowing.

65
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,570
I will definitely keep that in mind, Your Majesty.

66
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,740
Then name the type of game you want to play.

67
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,220
The game is to guess tonight's weather, Your Majesty.

68
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,850
We are to guess whether it will rain or be a clear day.

69
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,680
There's a 50/50 chance for either.

70
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,570
I believe it is a fair bet, Your Majesty.

71
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,340
Tonight's weather, you say?

72
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,210
You start betting first.

73
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,470
Then this servant

74
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,290
will guess that tonight it will rain.

75
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,400
Luckily,

76
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,010
I made a different choice.

77
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,730
As for me, I will choose the opposite answer.

78
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,200
Tonight will be

79
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,310
a clear night, as clear as any other.

80
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,660
Wife, watch this.

81
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,150
 I will win this time! 

82
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,380
 I, Baek Man Geum, will defeat the King. 

83
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,140
 Just watch me! 

84
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,890
 Tonight, there will surely be rain. 

85
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,300
The Royal Observers have predicted so,
 (Royal Observers: bureau of astronomers, meteorologists etc.) 

86
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,210
and there is no doubt at all when we look at the dark rain clouds coming.

87
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,700
Your Majesty, even if it's late, you must forfeit this bet.

88
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,930
A man does not go back on his word.

89
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,640
How is it possible to take back words already spoken?

90
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,660
Rain.

91
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,060
It's rain!!

92
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,370
Rain! Rain! Rain!

93
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,450
It's raining!! It's raining!

94
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,130
It's raining!

95
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,100
I won!

96
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,540
I beat the king!

97
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,080
This Baek Man Geum beat the king!

98
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,010
It's raining!

99
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,530
Rain, rain!

100
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,130
Does this make you that happy?

101
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,950
Wife?

102
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,120
You were here?

103
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,220
Wife! My wife!

104
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,620
I won!

105
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,620
I made a bet with the king, and I won!

106
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,390
So? What did you win?

107
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,170
What do you mean what did I win?

108
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,090
What's with your tone? I won!

109
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,200
What's wrong with my tone?

110
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,930
This is the palace. We have to follow the palace rules.

111
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,310
Anyway,

112
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,890
my wife, you don't need to stay here anymore.

113
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,090
You've become a free woman.

114
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,970
Free?

115
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,690
You're talking to me, who lived patiently with both hands and both feet shackled, about freedom?

116
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,080
Did you just tell me I am free?

117
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,860
Wife, why are you like this?

118
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,020
I bet you when I gambled with the king!

119
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,910
Uh... I mean.

120
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,200
That's not it, but that noble man, that owner of this kingdom, lied to me.

121
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,980
Wife, let's not squabble here. Let's go home.

122
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,970
Let's go home and I'll explain everything to you in detail.

123
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,480
Wife, let's—

124
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,780
If you want to go home, go by yourself. I am not going with you.

125
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,830
Honey—

126
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,730
I told you!

127
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,780
I was never free when I lived with you.

128
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,790
The start of our relationship was the beginning of my shackling.

129
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,170
Do you even know?

130
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,140
Being your wife and taking care of an irresponsible gambler,

131
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,330
I lived barely subsisting day to day.

132
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:33,950
Are you telling me to go back to you, the person who made my life so difficult?

133
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,510
Why? Why should I go back with you?!

134
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,970
If I hadn't known that I was regarded as a gambling ante,

135
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,170
then maybe (I would go with you), but no,

136
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,670
it's already too late.

137
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,260
Wife...

138
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,640
I am sorry I bet you as a gambling ante.

139
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,160
First, let's go home and—

140
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,100
Go back home.

141
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,160
I am no longer the Bok Soon you knew before.

142
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,560
I am no longer the wife of gambler Baek Man Geum.

143
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,110
Wife...

144
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,660
What will I do if you act like this?

145
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,200
I think something has gone wrong between us.

146
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,880
No, there is nothing wrong between us.

147
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,330
If there is one thing that is wrong,

148
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,630
it is the fact that you are here.

149
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,100
This is all because you, Yi Soo, moved the King.

150
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,940
My Liege, I want to ask you just one thing.

151
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,780
What is it?

152
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,880
If you don't want the king's head,

153
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,900
what do you want to accomplish in the end, Lord?

154
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,800
 Lee In Jwa 

155
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,620
I...

156
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,620
  I am going to open another era for this country, Joseon.  

157
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,120
  A country that is so bright that people's eyes will have trouble looking at us.  

158
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,300
  A country that is reachable even to those who are born fed with a dirt spoon. (a variation on the phrase, "served with a silver spoon.")

159
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,780
  A world that is open and reachable to any Joseon subject's hands.  

160
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,700
 Six months later, October 1693 

161
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,990
Congratulations, My Lady.

162
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,390
Your Majesty, it is a prince.

163
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,200
Hey!

164
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,850
Why don't we drink.

165
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,240
What?

166
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,280
You're laughing. Wow.

167
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,740
 This... Look at this crazy bastard! 

168
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,470
Hey, you!

169
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,860
 How dare you drink someone else's! 

170
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,330
Crazy bastard.

171
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,680
 They say Lady Sook Won, a water maid, has given birth to a prince.  

172
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,860
  Oh, that six-month premature baby?  

173
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,030
What do you mean six-month baby? Does that even make sense?

174
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,390
But doesn't he look too healthy for having been born as a six-month premature baby?

175
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,950
Didn't you hear?

176
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,330
Rumors that that six-month premature baby is not His Majesty's child are rampant.

177
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,690
 Lady Choi Sook Won (future Lady Choi Sook Bin) 

178
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,490
Lady Madam, here's some water to wash your face.

179
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,770
Why are you like that?

180
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,180
Why? Are there a lot of rumors because this child is a six-month baby?

181
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,640
They say that he is another man's baby.

182
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,640
They say he's not His Majesty's baby.

183
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,120
That is not it.

184
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,560
I know it all. I know,

185
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,790
and His Majesty also knows it.

186
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,610
Your Majesty, what do you mean a six-month premature baby?

187
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,070
We have never heard of such a thing!

188
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,690
In addition, how can a six-month baby be that healthy?

189
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,770
I do not wish to be rude,

190
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,630
but Lady Sook Won was a water maid...

191
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,960
Thus, she had a lot of freedom to come and go in the Palace.

192
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,160
And there are rumors that she was married.

193
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,680
Chongyungsa
 (Highest-ranked military commanding officer of Gyeongi Province and surrounding regions) 

194
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,660
Look at my eyes.

195
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,950
I am very sorry, Your Majesty.

196
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,890
After this meeting, anyone who says anything bad about Sook Won or the prince, Young Soo,

197
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,650
will receive severe punishment regardless of his position.

198
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,590
Royal Father!

199
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,930
 Crown Prince Yoon (future King Gyeongjong) 

200
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,570
Yes.

201
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,410
 Jang Ok Jeong (Lady Jang Hee Bin ) 

202
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,290
I will give you a tonic good for treating after-birth effects, so please take it.

203
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,440
Please rest a lot.

204
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,810
Your Highness, there is some kind of misunderstanding.

205
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,780
This child is really...

206
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,450
Leave it.

207
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,510
You...

208
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,830
Do you even have experience being bereaved?

209
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,150
It's hard to survive for even a year when you've been born at seven months,

210
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,870
but your baby was born only in six months...

211
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,240
What a situation you have.

212
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,730
You searched for me?

213
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,900
This child will die soon.

214
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,970
My Lady, how can you say such horrific words?

215
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,170
Since an epidemic broke out in the Yangju area,

216
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,380
I've heard a lot of people, regardless of the young or the old, have died.

217
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,540
Please exchange.

218
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,060
Please exchange this child for a child who died of the plague.

219
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,280
However, if Liege (Lee In Jwa) finds out about this plan...

220
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,790
I am begging you.

221
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't you also have a daughter?

222
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,930
He just fell asleep.

223
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,870
Wait!

224
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,530
Baby, please stay alive and live long.

225
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,320
Please.

226
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,240
What is it? What is it?

227
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,090
This is the child who was born just six months into the pregnancy.

228
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,190
He can't possibly be the king's son.

229
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,560
You're my child, aren't you?

230
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,980
You're really this Baek Man Geum's son?

231
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,720
This little guy is my child?

232
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,990
You are Baek Man Geum's child.

233
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,430
My Liege, the prince

234
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,030
has passed away.

235
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,880
That child is still alive.

236
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,760
Go and track Baek Man Geum.

237
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,520
Bring the child to me.

238
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,460
The prince who they say is dead

239
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,310
is definitely in his arms.

240
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,560
Wait.

241
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,920
The people who know of this truth are you and me

242
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,830
and no one else.

243
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,140
Then...

244
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,070
Baek Man Geum.

245
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,720
Kill him.

246
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,770
I tried to overlook it, considering Sook Won's situation,

247
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,160
but leaving a possibility of future turmoil,

248
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,590
bothers me.

249
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,960
Please give your command.

250
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,380
- Why... Why are you doing this?
- This child has no right to live.

251
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,420
Where in this world is there a child who has no right to live?

252
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,990
And why is it this child who cannot live?

253
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,970
I truly regret this.

254
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,850
Move.

255
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,280
As he is willing to kill his own child,

256
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,780
he is such a cruel king, don't you think?

257
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,040
It doesn't matter if Baek Man Geum dies,

258
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,220
but I must save the child.

259
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,760
Then you can guide him to the road to death.

260
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,110
Oh.... No no no no....

261
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,920
You soulless monsters!

262
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,440
You should receive Heaven's punishments for this!

263
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,920
He's just a baby!

264
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,250
You should die!

265
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,680
Do what you want with me. I don't care if I die.

266
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,080
I'll die with him. Do whatever you want.

267
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,920
The baby... The baby... The baby is alive!

268
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,390
The baby was alive!!!!

269
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,080
The baby is alive!

270
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,110
He's alive! He's alive

271
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,590
Baek Man Geum and the child are both dead?

272
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,160
You are a terrible liar.

273
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,300
With such an innocent spirit, how can you accomplish ambitious things?

274
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,540
I'm sorry, My Liege.

275
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,560
What a magnificent place this is!

276
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,600
Oh, my, look at the column.  How much is it worth?

277
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:21,620
Five-hundred nyang.  Bring Baek Man Geum's child to me.

278
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,440
When you've done what I've asked, I will give you 300 nyang more.

279
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,420
I might just fall for you.

280
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,860
Well, please wait just a moment.  I will bring the child right away.

281
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,000
All right. You said someone stopped you.

282
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,300
Yes, My Liege. His skills in archery were not like the others.

283
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,740
Dam Seo!

284
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,620
Father!

285
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,960
Let's go inside.

286
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,700
It's lucky that the blade missed all the vital acupuncture points.

287
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,300
This is really a blessing from heaven.

288
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,720
Of course! He's my child after all.

289
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,400
It's all right, it's all right.

290
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,220
He grasps my hand as if he understands what I'm saying.

291
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,340
It's all right, it's all right, my darling.

292
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,380
You grabbed my finger.

293
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:51,920
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki 

294
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,740
The child died, you say?

295
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,480
Y-Y-Your Majesty...

296
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,280
Yi Soo.

297
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,640
I thought you were my friend.

298
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,740
I thought at least you would be different from others.

299
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,020
Y-Y-Your Majesty, but—

300
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,580
I cannot stand people plotting behind my back.

301
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,840
Even if my own mother or child deceived me like this,

302
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,340
I wouldn't forgive that.

303
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,460
Who are you working for?

304
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,280
Bring forth

305
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,720
that person's head.

306
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,880
If you do, I will spare your daughter's life.

307
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,820
Do you remember this place?

308
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,840
This is where I saved you for the second time, and I decided to name you

309
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,420
"Yi Soo", meaning "two lives",

310
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,760
in this bamboo forest.

311
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,740
That day, you gave me that name

312
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,940
and gave me a reason to live as well.

313
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,420
I couldn't ignore the fact that you wanted to save your daughter.

314
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:51,100
If you've made your choice, do not hold back.

315
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,480
What I mean is, don't live with your heart on your sleeve.

316
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,960
You stupid young fool.

317
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,540
I told you to not live with your heart on your sleeve.

318
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm sorry.

319
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,960
Your daughter...

320
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,920
I'll protect her.

321
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:31,120
My Lord, thank you. Thank...

322
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,460
Don't forget,

323
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,180
and don't forgive.

324
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:43,100
That a wretched person, who can't even compare to animals, is this country's

325
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,400
king.

326
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,440
You can't just go in like this. My Lady...

327
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,140
Sir, what is the meaning of this?

328
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,680
I am looking at you, bitch, through different eyes.

329
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,300
Bitch? Please speak more politely.

330
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,360
You want to be respected because you are the king's woman?

331
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,440
If you want to, you should have done better.

332
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,420
What have I done wrong?

333
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,500
Ridiculous.

334
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,760
Do you really think I know nothing?

335
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,540
I always heard that girls often changed their hearts.

336
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,360
But I thought you would be unfeeling, since you were from the lowborn.

337
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,780
Please go back.

338
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,080
This man, who has no official position nor any relationship with me, entered the concubine's quarters.

339
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,900
Do you realize the seriousness of your crime?

340
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,180
Shut up!

341
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,190
Foolish wench.

342
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:58,280
Your provocative behavior has cost the innocent General Kim his life.

343
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,830
And the child? What happened to the child?

344
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:22,440
If you want to save the child, come to the pavilion outside the Great Western Gate tonight at haeshi (9–11 pm).

345
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,780
Heed my words.

346
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:32,020
If you go against my orders again, you and the child

347
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,670
will surely die.

348
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,620
Even number!

349
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,670
One more time!

350
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
Let's give it another go.

351
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,840
Hey, hey. Stay still for Daddy.  Don't cry.

352
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,140
Hurry up!

353
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,940
Sweetie, I'm in the middle of something important.

354
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,530
- I said hurry up! 
- I heard ya!

355
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,430
You have no luck at all! Why did you make the child cry? Hey, let's go.

356
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,130
Let's go!

357
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,870
Wait, wait, don't leave!

358
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:34,120
Sweetie, I'm in the middle of something important. If I grab this chance...

359
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,290
Geez, they all left.

360
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,600
- Let me see. 
 - You jerk, what are you—

361
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,630
Aigoo, this brat.

362
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:51,730
 ♫ The lark above that gardenia tree goes "chirp chirp." ♫ 

363
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,930
Look at him laugh!

364
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,360
What are you doing?

365
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,740
You fill your own stomach with wine and meat

366
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,100
and let this poor child starve to death. Is that right?!

367
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,270
Barmaid!

368
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:11,220
Yes?

369
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,580
I'll pay you a lot, so please nurse this child.

370
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:20,110
Yes. Miss! We need to nurse him!

371
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,460
Please do...

372
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,220
I am thankful but, wait a second.

373
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,610
Where have I seen you before?

374
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,840
At the gambling den. The gambling den!

375
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,330
You bastard, I ought to—

376
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,630
It's not too late.

377
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,240
What is not late?

378
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,130
Your hand.

379
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,830
I said it's not too late.

380
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,430
Even if you end up as a leather worker or lumberjack, stop gambling!

381
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,460
Get your life together!

382
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,310
Don't regret it later when you're old like me and have lost everything.

383
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,020
What is he saying?

384
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,090
How can he be so strong?

385
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,720
He sucks the milk very well!

386
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,580
You had breast milk?

387
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,490
He has the face of a noble.

388
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,140
What his name?

389
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,600
I haven't named him yet,

390
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,150
but I think Gae Ttong might suitable. Gae Ttong.
 (Gae Ttong: Dog poop) 

391
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,540
Gae Ttong.

392
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,910
- Gae Ttong. Gae Ttong.
-  Isn't that good? Gae Ttong, answer me.

393
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,560
Gae Ttong.

394
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,000
Stop kissing him. His noble features will go away.

395
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,240
Aigoo, he's my child, and I'll do whatever I want with him.

396
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,350
Wait.

397
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,130
Did you say that he has the face of a noble?

398
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,600
It's so symmetrical.

399
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,150
Yeah, you want me to prove it?

400
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:22,030
"Dae" as in "great" and "Gil" as in "fortune, luck." He has a very fortunate fate.

401
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:27,240
He can't be the king in the royal palace, but  with this face he could become at least the ruler of the country beggars.

402
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,330
His face is the face of a future king? This little guy?

403
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,830
Hey, don't try to fool me.

404
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,360
This person. Have you lived your life getting fooled?

405
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:44,240
Should I show you again?  You seem to have a hard time trusting people.

406
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,630
Ta-da.

407
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,230
Oh my goodness, how can this be?
 Life — Great Fortune 

408
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,030
In all my life,

409
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,860
this the first time I've ever experienced this.

410
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,650
The face of a future king?

411
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,350
 I can kill you 

412
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,720
 right on this spot. 

413
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,860
  Go back. 

414
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,570
  I am no longer the Bok Soon you knew. 

415
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,200
 What? 

416
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,210
 You idiotic fool. 

417
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:05,730
  This child was the king's child. The king's child... 

418
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,970
 He is not my child. 

419
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,900
He's those bastards' son.

420
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,260
This little... Hey!

421
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:36,330
Wicked bitch... You thought I'd raise the king's son?

422
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,510
Watch this.

423
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,280
Watch this, you rotten wench and bastard!

424
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,600
Look what Baek Man Geum is going to do!

425
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,480
Did you see that?!

426
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,920
Bok Soon, did you see me?!

427
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,450
I just killed your child!

428
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,950
You foolish king, do you see that?!

429
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,690
This Baek Man Geum just killed your son!

430
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,270
I did it!

431
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,970
I killed someone!

432
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,970
This Baek Man Geum just killed someone.

433
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,040
Oh my goodness!

434
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,740
Didn't I tell you?!

435
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,150
He's a precious and special child.

436
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,960
Just because you want to kill him,

437
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,620
you cannot do so, as you can not change his fate.

438
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,060
What are you doing? Come down and get him.

439
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,030
I don't know anything about that.

440
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:33,910
I've never seen him before nor raised him.

441
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:36,780
Got it?!

442
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,500
Damn it.

443
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,700
Man Geum!

444
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,260
Man Geum! Come here, bastard!

445
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,420
Oh, Hong Mae.

446
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,280
What brings you here?

447
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,120
I have a dog's skilled nose.

448
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,710
He's Man Geum's child, right?

449
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,070
No, you can't take him!

450
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,570
No! No!

451
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,430
Don't!

452
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,210
Gently, gently!

453
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,940
You're going to live with me, then?

454
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,200
Oh my. He's looking at me and smiling.

455
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,990
Maybe he thinks I'm his mother.

456
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,060
What are you planning to do with that infant?

457
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,270
Tell Man Geum if he wants his child back, he needs to repay his debts quickly.

458
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,060
What kind of thief bastard would steal—?!

459
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,720
I'm not a "bastard," but a "bitch."

460
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,250
Look here!

461
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,700
Aigoo, aigoo.

462
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:58,220
You pathetic man!  How can you drink when your  child is taken?

463
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:03,340
Who's my child? What child?!

464
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,750
You retard!

465
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:10,620
Hong Mae, that wicked witch, took your child.

466
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,930
Just how much do you owe her?!

467
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,570
Tell me!

468
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,250
You, bring out all the money you have,

469
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,160
We have to get Gae Ttong back!

470
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,440
I'm flat broke.

471
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,390
Even if I have money, I won't search for him! He's not even my child, why would I?!

472
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:36,080
You barbaric thing!

473
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,060
You have no right to be a father.

474
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,250
All right then.

475
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,350
I'm going to go find the child myself!

476
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,540
Rotten bastard.

477
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,150
You think I'll follow you?!

478
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,440
For whose sake. You're joking.

479
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,230
I met those garbage-like wrench and bastard. Go tell them to eat dirt!  (orig. "yeot,'' euphemism for f*** off, circa 1960s CSAT) 

480
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:06,040
With a good forehead, bright eyes, clearly defined philtrum (vertical groove between nose and upper lip), and handsome lips,

481
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,660
you have a good countenance.

482
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,910
Your heart is warm and steady.

483
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,830
Since you survived a blade as a newborn,

484
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,660
You were born with a very strong fate.

485
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,350
Your eyes show that you will be king.

486
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,370
That's right.

487
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,230
Tonight, your destiny,

488
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,940
let's test it further.

489
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,170
I'm sorry, but Lady Sook Won has already—

490
00:52:56,350 --> 00:53:02,370
 If you want to save the child, come to the pavilion outside the Great Western Gate tonight at haeshi (9–11 pm). 

491
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:11,200
  If you disobey me one more time, your life and the child's 

492
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,210
  will be no more. 

493
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,860
What should I do?

494
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:11,060
Wait. Isn't he that aloof scholar?

495
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:17,560
Why on earth would they play with a newborn baby?

496
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,600
What in the world do you think you're doing!

497
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,440
Do you still think you are human?

498
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:42,790
You look terrible.

499
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:45,570
I guess that's all a mother's heart.

500
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,230
Tell me,

501
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,640
what should I do for you to return the child to me?

502
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,710
That's right. That's how you should act.

503
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:02,780
How about playing a round with me with that child's fate on the line?

504
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,530
What kind of game are you playing at?!

505
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,490
Game?

506
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,830
Do you think I'm playing a game with you?

507
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,470
There is a 10-point tag among the tags.

508
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:20,950
If you can somehow find that 10-point tag within three turns,

509
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,800
then I will return the child to you.

510
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,740
However,

511
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,950
if you fail...

512
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,560
MY LORD!

513
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,590
An arrow for every wrong tag.

514
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:41,680
Three out of five is not a bad chance at all.

515
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,910
Go ahead and choose.

516
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,330
You have two more chances.

517
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,920
My Lord, I have wronged you.

518
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,240
- Please, please, my child— 
 - TWO MORE!

519
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,790
Didn't I say you have two more chances?

520
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,520
WAIT A MOMENT!

521
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,700
Now you only have one more chance left.

522
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,650
I reckon that child

523
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,560
noticed his mother's luck is this good.

524
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,220
Choose the last one.

525
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:44,200
The life or death of that child is in your hands now.

526
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,420
Lord,

527
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,210
please

528
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,620
spare the child.

529
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,600
Instead, please kill me

530
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,490
and spare the child!

531
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:02,850
What use is there to kill you?

532
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:08,020
When I freed you from that pathetic gambler,

533
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,250
didn't I already save you at that time?

534
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,730
Hurry up and pick one.

535
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,540
So it's not too late yet,

536
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,860
for me.

537
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,790
Baek Man Geum.

538
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,790
I'll pick the last one,

539
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:04,210
but if I pick the right one,

540
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,310
do not even touch my child.

541
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,700
Got that?

542
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:34,300

 Preview 

544
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,750
 I command you to offer the full truth! 

545
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,010
 I'll end your life by all means. 

546
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,120
 Do you want to kill me? I'm the one that ruined your clan. 

547
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,180
 It seems a welcome guest is here. 

548
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,720
 It seems Lady Sook Won is pregnant. 

549
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,470
 Finally! That guy came. 

550
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,810
 You mean that infamous player, Prince Yeoning? 

551
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,590
 That girl, I've just picked her out to me mine. 

552
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:13,790
 What is your name?   

553
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:17,850
 In any case, you are my bride.  Don't even think otherwise.
