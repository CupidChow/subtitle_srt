00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,720
 Episode 18 

2
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,250
Royal Father.

3
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,310
Royal Father!

4
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,410
Royal Father!!

5
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,640
Where are you going?

6
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,500
Now I have to do what I need to do. Call Yeon Hwa please.

7
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,570
I have something to say when we're all together.

8
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,190
Understood.

9
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,660
 Prince Yeoning, future King Yeongjo 

10
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,060
Your Majesty. Royal Father!

11
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,960
Royal Father. Royal Father.

12
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,420
Your Majesty.

13
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,970
Please open your eyes! 
   (King Sookjong) 

14
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,350
Your Majesty. 
  (Crown Prince Yoon, future King Gyeongjong) 

15
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,720
Please get up, Royal Father. 
  (Prince Yeonryeong, Yi Hwon, King Sookjong's sixth son) 

16
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,420
 Kim Che Geon 

17
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Royal Father.

18
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,560
Father.

19
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,950
Stay back.

20
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,340
It's you, Father, right?

21
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,220
I told you to stay away.

22
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,300
Father, what happened to you?

23
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,560
How did you come back alive?

24
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Though things may look like this, I'm still your father.

25
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,190
Your father... Your father is very sorry.

26
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,890
So very sorry.

27
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,420
Is saying sorry all? How could you show yourself now, when you've been alive this whole time?

28
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,140
I thought you had died. Do you know how hard I searched for you?

29
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,910
Tell me. Why did you pretend to be dead?

30
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,630
What is the cause?

31
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,650
Though his pulse is weak, his heart is still beating. Though it's shallow, his breathing is stable,

32
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,210
and his temperature is normal too.

33
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,360
The cause. I am asking you the cause

34
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,800
for His Majesty, who was completely healthy up until last night—the reason he suddenly collapsed.

35
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,450
T-T-Though I am not... certain,

36
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,110
it is the opium incense.

37
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,050
Incense.

38
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,610
Yes.

39
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,880
Because it's made from the opium poppy, it dulls pain.

40
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,340
Its poisonous properties are potent, so I cautioned him not to burn it often.

41
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,830
Are you saying you prescribed opium to His Majesty?

42
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,350
Y-Yes.

43
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,200
But how is it that no one knew of that fact?

44
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,910
Y-yes. H-His Majesty

45
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,440
commanded it should be kept an absolute secret...

46
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,270
- Your Highness. 
 - Your Highness.

47
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,980
How is his majesty's health? 
  (Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip) 

48
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,350
Fortunately, he seems to have passed the critical stage.

49
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,730
It is truly fortunate.

50
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,260
 Choi Yi Seok, Jo Il Soo,  Kim Il Gyeong 

51
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,270
Then I will see you again.

52
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,080
Your Highness.

53
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,390
Is this all?

54
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,210
Yes, Your Highness

55
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,050
Of these, which incense has opium mixed in?

56
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,830
Can this incense make it possible to lose consciousness?

57
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,740
The poppy flower has potent poisonous properties. If one is not careful, it is possible to lose one's life.

58
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,450
Then why in the world

59
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,870
was opium prescribed for His Majesty?

60
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,380
For the last two years, His Majesty has been suffering from pain due to a gallstone.

61
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,180
At times he would vomit blood too.

62
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,150
Royal Father

63
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,280
has been suffering without letting it be known?

64
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,780
Deceiving the Crown Prince, me, and all the court ministers of all ranks?

65
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,850
How is this incense with poppy mixed in being supplied?

66
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,260
The incense used by the Royal Pharmacy is all from the Bureau of Medical Administration and Education.

67
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,910
But I don't know how the materials are traded there.

68
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,960
Have you confirmed it?

69
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,740
I'm asking if every single incense holder permitted into the King's sleeping quarters has been verified.

70
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,920
Yes it has, Your Highness.

71
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,510
We checked them by burning them, one by one, to confirm,

72
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:52,500
It is not possible to burn them all... I offer my sincere apologies, Your Highness.

73
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,230
So you made a deal with Yi In Jwa?

74
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,990
Father, did I ever say I wanted to be King?

75
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,010
I've never thought of a thing like that, and I don't want to do it either!

76
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,560
I just... need you, Father.

77
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,390
Father, stop what you're doing now and just come live with me, please?

78
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,550
I can't.

79
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,160
Why can't you?

80
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,060
Dae Gil, your life... from this moment on is not only yours alone.

81
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,140
If my life is not mine, then whose is it?

82
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,650
The people's.

83
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,150
And even my life isn't mine alone.

84
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,060
Why is your life not yours, Father?

85
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,100
What are you talking about?

86
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,990
You'll find out soon. It's not time yet.

87
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
Please explain in a way I can understand. Please?

88
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,050
Dae Gil, I'll tell you starting now, so be alert and pay careful attention to what I say.

89
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,420
Dae Gil.

90
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,070
Who is he?

91
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,090
Dae Gil, mark my words. Understand?

92
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,220
Father.

93
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,530
Your father will return. Until then, you know what to do, okay?

94
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,440
You saw Man Geum?!

95
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,080
What are you saying?

96
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,000
Your father is alive?!  Is this for real?

97
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Man Geum! Let me see you, too.

98
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,900
He said we shouldn't look for him.

99
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,440
What do you mean, don't go look for him?

100
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,170
  It's not time yet. 

101
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,520
 I have stuff I have to do, so you do what you need to do. 

102
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,820
 All right? 

103
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,210
Father

104
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,770
has been alive.

105
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,810
You're saying Man Geum has been alive!

106
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,280
Heaven has helped him!

107
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,050
It's because of heaven's help he is still alive.

108
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,450
Man Geum!

109
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,320
Man... Huh?

110
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,050
What's matter?

111
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,160
The king has collapsed?

112
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,510
Hence, it appears I have to stay beside the King and protect him for a while.

113
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,980
Yi In Jwa.

114
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,810
It's Yi In Jwa's doing.

115
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,280
Do you have proof? How can a person who's in prison...

116
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,470
Or that traitor Jeong's doing.

117
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,340
Even though there is no proof, I know it.

118
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,750
That the King collapsed or that I almost parted from my father for good,

119
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,210
all of those must have happened in the palms of Yi In Jwa's hands.

120
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,660
Does the King's life end here? 
  (Yi In Jwa) 

121
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,590
He is still a big fish even though rotten, and the tiger is still a tiger even though he lost his teeth.

122
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,020
His force is so strong that I can't read his fate at all.

123
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,060
He doesn't seem to have expired.

124
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,350
  How did you get the news so quickly? 

125
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,150
Because I am sharp-eared.

126
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,820
By the way, what order of business brings you here?

127
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,570
Of course, I don't like you and your comrades.

128
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,510
Your lucky fate that evaded thunder and cut through even the raging waves, 
  (Kim Il Gyeong) 

129
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,470
I can't help but acknowledge it.

130
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,160
So have you changed your mind?

131
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,840
I'll save you.

132
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,170
I'll persuade His Highness the Crown Prince and get you acquitted.

133
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,460
What do you think of the position of Royal Secretary responsible for the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce?

134
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,980
Ah. If not, then how about the Minister of Justice?

135
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,170
Isn't that what you want?

136
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,320
Are you mocking me right now?

137
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,770
For someone who evaded a thunderbolt

138
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,520
and cut through the raging waves, such as I, Yi In Jwa,

139
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,150
would be able to give you such a trifling position, don't you think?

140
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,130
If you don't like that position,

141
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,220
I'll put a sword in your hands.

142
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,760
- Sword? 
 - Yes.

143
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,360
I'll let you hold a sword in your lordship's hands.

144
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,750
With your hands,

145
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,750
how do you think you'd remove the Noron ministers?

146
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,220
Your Highness.

147
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,910
I'm worried the people will be swayed and their hearts will be agitated over this matter.

148
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,750
Please pardon the criminals to show them your virtue,

149
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,500
and stabilize the minds of the disturbed people outside of the palace.

150
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,040
Excuse you.

151
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,880
Your Highness. Including Yi In Jwa,

152
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,970
by punishing the traitors who plotted treason by beheading, 
  (Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip) 

153
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,930
you should harden the royal resolve at a time like this.

154
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,730
- Excuse you. 
 - No, excuse YOU.

155
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,140
Stop.

156
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,080
In a situation where the King is unconscious,

157
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,790
how can I carry out an execution and disturb the people?

158
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,990
Then,

159
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,620
as for the traitor Yi In Jwa,

160
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,350
are you saying you're planning on having him released?

161
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,830
Let's talk privately. Now.

162
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,640
What is your true intention?

163
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,310
Your intention for opposing me?

164
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,410
If our father the King wakes,

165
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,520
how on earth are you planning to deal with the aftermath?

166
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,690
I am this nation's Crown Prince.

167
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,820
Appropriately, in place of  His Majesty,

168
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,070
I have a right to discuss the nation's affairs. But you!

169
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,920
What are you that you're on such a high horse?

170
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,620
Really,

171
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,850
do you intend... to protect the traitor Yi In Jwa?

172
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,750
He is not a traitor! How is that fellow a traitor?

173
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,060
Crown Prince,

174
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,230
it is because he covets the throne.

175
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,840
Covets the throne, you say?

176
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,000
Then,

177
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,590
can you swear that you don't covet the throne?

178
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,480
I see.

179
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,700
I should have caught on earlier.

180
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,320
Military authorization tag.

181
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,940
Your eyes when you showed that military authorization tag and threatened me!

182
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,920
Now I know...

183
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,060
who is a friend

184
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,680
and who is a foe.

185
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,540
 Trample on them. 

186
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,790
 If anyone looks down on you, 

187
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,660
 never forgive them, do you understand? 

188
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,660
 You must not make mistakes like I did. 

189
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,320
What kind of deal did you make with my father?

190
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,820
So you met Baek Man Geum?

191
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,000
I expected that.

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,890
Since I am in prison and even Royal Consort Sook has passed away,

193
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,780
it was time for him to show up.

194
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,540
So,

195
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,840
how does it feel to meet again the father whom you had thought was dead?

196
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,200
If I could,

197
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,930
to cut off this tiresome ill-fated connection

198
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,020
and go somewhere far away with my father, that's what I wanted

199
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,730
until a little while ago.

200
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,930
But,

201
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,370
after I saw your disgusting face,

202
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,700
I don't have the courage to do that anymore.

203
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,200
The courage to forgive you,

204
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,290
and to forget everything.

205
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,190
That's exactly it.

206
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,640
The reason why I can't give you up.

207
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,150
Your strong will.

208
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,560
You think you can avoid execution, don't you?

209
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,730
You know already of the misfortune that has befallen the King.

210
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,150
That was your doing, wasn't it?

211
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,750
Do you have proof?

212
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,160
Return home.

213
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,650
 Royal Investigation Bureau 

214
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:33,900
 I'll get out of this prison first, then I'll look for you again. 

215
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,970
 Someone said to come here. 

216
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,630
They say you just met your father.

217
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,590
I heard that the King has collapsed.

218
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,450
It's incense that was mixed with opium.

219
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,270
There were only ashes left in the jar that Father had been using.

220
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,610
There is no proof.

221
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,760
However, the bigger problem lies

222
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,770
with the ministers who are against sentencing Yi In Jwa.

223
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:33,810
Your Highness! Please pardon the offenses of the criminals!

224
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:38,320
Please pardon the offenses of the offenders, Your Highness!

225
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,550
 As well as the Sorons, even among the Sungkyunkwan scholars, 

226
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,810
 they are writing petitions to free Yi In Jwa. 

227
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,720
What should we do?

228
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,800
I'm ordering

229
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,130
the release of the offender Yi In Jwa with an acquittal also and grant his subordinates a special pardon.

230
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,030
Your Highness! You must not do that!

231
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,850
You must not do that! Crown Prince!

232
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,500
Crown Prince!

233
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Crown Prince!

234
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,590
You must not do that!

235
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,040
Yi In Jwa has

236
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,430
been acquitted.

237
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,050
Your Highness.

238
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,850
You've suffered a lot.

239
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,190
Your grace is overflowing, Your Highness.

240
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,570
Baek Dae Gil.

241
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,210
What's your identity?

242
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,750
What in the world is your identity that you sell your name here and there?

243
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:39,870
Was it Your Highness... who released Yi In Jwa?

244
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,380
That sword is...

245
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,200
 is really treasured by Father. 

246
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,320
 He has never given me such a gift. 

247
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,140
You really look like

248
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,720
Prince Yeoning— 
 No, more like Her Highness Royal Consort Sook.

249
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,830
You really do look like Royal Father.

250
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,860
Your father is the gambler Baek Man Geum, right?

251
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,520
How did you know?

252
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,800
You probably don't know, but long ago, your father was arrested and brought to the palace.

253
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,180
  I don't know! I said I don't know. 

254
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,260
 It was something that happened when I was quite young, so my own memory about it is a bit faded. 

255
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,400
What is your birthday?

256
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,730
I don't really know.

257
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,710
Yi In Jwa recommended you.

258
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,350
He asked me to give you an official position.

259
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,110
I don't know the reason so I can't just give it to you.

260
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,470
I can no longer fully trust Yi In Jwa, who was charged as a traitor, either.

261
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:26,970
That's why, Baek Dae Gil, I want you to dig into him.

262
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,800
Since you are a disciple of Kim Che Geon, from this point on, I grant you the position of a commissioned cavalry officer at Capital Garrison Command.

263
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,080
Put this on.

264
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,580
If I refuse, what will happen?

265
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,760
Since the King is sick and bedridden, the Crown Prince's order is the same as the King's order.

266
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,060
Accept it since it's not such a high position.

267
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,330
You look cool in that uniform.

268
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,180
Accept this.

269
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,680
Commissioned Cavalry Officer?

270
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,680
Even though it's been a while, I was also a commissioned cavalry officer.

271
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,750
Even though the position is not high, you can enter and leave the palace freely.

272
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,520
Compared to other positions, there is less interference and more freedom of movement.

273
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,470
So what about it.

274
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,360
Since you are a military officer, you should take pride in yourself.

275
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,020
You little brat.

276
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,670
Royal Father!

277
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,010
Your Majesty!

278
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,190
Sir.

279
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,960
They say His Majesty the King has regained consciousness.

280
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,800
However, as soon as he awoke, he called for you, sire.

281
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,270
Your Highness. Your Highness. Your Highness.

282
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,830
Please wait a moment.

283
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,260
Before discussing the national affairs,

284
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:21,300
for the sake of stabilizing the minds of the people, the offenders will be specially pardoned,

285
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:27,440
so release Yi In Jwa and all his subordinates.

286
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,370
Hwon.

287
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,490
Please step out for a moment.

288
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,630
Yes, Royal Father.

289
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,140
You released the traitor, Yi In Jwa?

290
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

291
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,540
 After Your Majesty had lost consciousness— 

292
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:03,710
Now I'm tired of even being disappointed in you, yet again.

293
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,810
Get out right now.

294
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,730
I...

295
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,220
really resent you, Royal Father.

296
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,150
What?

297
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,950
Around when can I ever gain your favor?

298
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,950
Even after becoming the Crown Prince, and even reigning as a regent,

299
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,420
I have been always pushed to the back by Prince Yeoning and Prince Yeonryeong,

300
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,910
always taking a backseat in your heart.

301
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,180
Am I truly the eldest son?

302
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,340
Why on earth did you install me as the Crown Prince?

303
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,520
Your Highness Big Brother,

304
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,930
may I see His Majesty the Royal Father now?

305
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,090
Summon Kim Che Geon.

306
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,170
He's waiting for you.

307
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,150
It looks good on you.

308
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,500
Yi In Jwa recommended you, didn't he?

309
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:11,260
 Is it possible he's trying to create an estrangement between me and Baek Dae Gil? 

310
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,060
Why are you looking at me like that?

311
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:19,780
Are you a friend or a foe?

312
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,320
Your Highness.

313
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,400
Who are you?

314
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,660
My name is Baek Dae Gil.

315
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,840
Baek Dae Gil.

316
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,050
Can I see you privately for a moment?

317
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,880
You may take your leave of me now.

318
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:12,780
  Are you a friend, or are you a foe? 

319
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,890
Distrust spreads faster than anything else.

320
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,330
Baek Dae Gil and Prince Yeoning will soon know

321
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,630
who is a friend and who is a foe.

322
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,100
You. Have some.

323
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,850
There was opium in the incense, wasn't there?

324
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,620
He said he didn't tell because he was afraid of the responsibility.

325
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,610
So you knew?

326
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,490
- Yes. 
 - Your Highness.

327
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,200
Even though you try to take care of it by yourself without telling us,

328
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,350
they are not people who would fall into your hands.

329
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,400
Your Highness. He already plotted treason 20 years ago.

330
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,320
And he has controlled the royal court from behind the Crown Prince for 20 years.

331
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,290
If I had opened my mouth, he would have hidden his tails.

332
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:29,310
- Further since I don't have proof, so the results won't change.
 - Your Highness

333
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,620
You are not the only one who lives in this palace.

334
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,250
Don't do things by yourself, seek help when you need it.

335
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,710
Yes.  I will do that next time.

336
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,390
Congratulations, Commissioned Cavalry Officer, sire

337
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,950
Congratulations, Sir Commissioned Cavalry Officer.

338
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:58,410
- Wow, look at the uniform. It's really cool. 
 - Stop it

339
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,770
Yi In Jwa has been set free.  Now is not the time to be celebrating.

340
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,570
I know.  I just wanted to make you laugh a little.

341
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,630
Can't you think of this as a short break after a long race?

342
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,770
We can capture In Jwa anytime.

343
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,670
Don't be too down, okay?

344
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:29,160
 I'll promise, instead, that I'll make it so no one will get hurt. 

345
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,810
 Never again, not a single one of my people. 

346
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,540
That sword of yours,

347
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,760
who do you raise it for?  (where does your loyalty lie?) 

348
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,400
Only for you, Your Majesty.

349
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:50,790
Kill Yi In Jwa.

350
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,520
Attacking in the dark or from behind or assassinating...

351
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,030
Don't use such a dirty trick.

352
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,970
Open the front gate and confidently,

353
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,590
because you are me,

354
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,750
because you are my sword,

355
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,720
bring

356
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,750
Yi In Jwa...

357
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,690
that bastard's, neck!

358
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

359
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,210
   Are you inside? 

360
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,110
 Jeong Hee Ryang 

361
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,130
There are many who are keeping tabs on me.

362
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,670
You are treading on dangerous ground here.

363
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,350
Then I also have to express my thanks to you.

364
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,580
Actually, I had wished that he'd just die.

365
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,890
It's regrettable how things turned out.

366
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,100
You're not here to tell me that.

367
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,750
Do you really want to make that fellow Baek Dae Gil king?

368
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:08,040
If by chance you want to be king...

369
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,190
- I have no desire to become king.
 - Then what?

370
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,710
I am planning on testing you.

371
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,470
With your outstandingly fortunate luck, you saved yourself from execution.

372
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,930
However, if all you have is luck,

373
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,570
it's a bit hard for me to become allies with you.

374
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,040
So?

375
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,190
I guess you don't know yet. The King has awakened.

376
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,110
I am planning on

377
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,160
testing your skills, using this moment. I, Jeong Hee Ryang, will do so.

378
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,620
 What are you thinking of? 

379
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,350
First, Baek Dae Gil.

380
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:04,070
I plan on prodding him. Second,

381
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:08,970
since the king who has awakened has no intention of letting you be,

382
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,800
we will see what your next move is.

383
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,550
 The king has awakened...The king has... 

384
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,550
Today is the anniversary of his passing, isn't it?

385
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,740
- Why are you here again?  
 -  Don't be surprised.

386
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,730
Today I came as Yi Soo's friend.

387
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,730
I have a lot of debt. I ceaselessly sprinkled blood.

388
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,860
When I lost comrades due to the failure of the great cause in the year of Jeongchook (1697).

389
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,720
Also, to those who had lost their lives

390
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,550
preparing for the great cause for such a long time—

391
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:48,130
Don't justify Father's death.

392
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,390
I can't make any justification. No matter how beautifully it is presented,

393
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:58,950
I can't lift my head confidently before your late father.

394
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,740
Your father, Yi Soo, and the countless other people who came together for the same cause, and died,

395
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,950
with their dreams and their blood and sweat,

396
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,660
their lives were laid down for the great cause.

397
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:16,500
Accomplishing that great cause is the only way to console the souls of those who are deceased.

398
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,180
Teacher, he has never once

399
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,810
come here to ask forgiveness.

400
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:28,570
Don't you know yet? Your teacher is still waiting.

401
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,640
After the great cause is accomplished, the day to apologize to your father,

402
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,950
he is counting the days until that time.

403
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,530
That's a disgusting excuse.

404
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,290
Please go back now.

405
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,640
Think back on it, how your teacher

406
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,340
looked at you.

407
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,630
Probably, to Yi In Jwa,

408
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,560
you were the only one.

409
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,600
You have to hurry.

410
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,750
The best swordsman in Joseon, Kim Che Geon,

411
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,980
will kill your teacher.

412
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,410
 For you, I'm planning on sending a small gift. 

413
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,480
My Liege. If the Current Crown is on the move,

414
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,360
isn't it wise for us to hide ourselves now?

415
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,560
What do you mean, "hide," when we were just cleared of all charges! 
 Hwang Jin Gi 

416
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,480
Tell them to come! Whoever they are, I will defeat them with a single blow!

417
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,700
I feel uneasy.

418
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,830
Pack our things right now.

419
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,750
Yi In Jwa.

420
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,980
To implement the king's command,

421
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,930
I came here to take your neck.

422
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,870
So, he was chasing after me.

423
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,360
That bandit didn't even have a topknot, just a bare head with a big—

424
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,520
Grandpa, go inside with Seol Im.

425
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,730
Seol Im, come here. Hurry, hurry.

426
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:07,300
Yes. Kim Che Geon. Let's see the end today.

427
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,890
If you want to.

428
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,650
Where did Dam Seo go?

429
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,360
 Jang Gil San 

430
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,150
The King of a nation

431
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,950
is playing such a foul trick?

432
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:03,690
If you have something to say, say it to the Lord of Hell.

433
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,650
Dam Seo.

434
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,450
 Think back on 

435
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,550
 how your teacher looked at you. 

436
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,710
 Probably, to Yi In Jwa,  you were the only one. 

437
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,730
 Teacher, you looked at me like this at that time, too. 

438
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:45,250
 Dam Seo, you are my daughter, 

439
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:50,640
  you are my life, and you are my everything. 

440
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,850
 That is my Great Cause 

441
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:59,930
 And that is my belief. 

442
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,780
 Now, I'm going to lay everything down. 

443
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,100
Move aside.

444
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,620
If you want to slash my teacher, you have to slash me first.

445
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,550
If you don't want to waste your precious life,

446
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:20,550
quickly move aside.

447
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,340
Stop!

448
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,470
  - Dam Seo.  
  - Baek Dae Gil.  

449
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,830
Master.

450
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,870
 Bring 

451
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:04,830
  Yi In Jwa... that bastard's neck. 

452
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,740
NO!

453
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,400
Dam Seo.

454
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,900
With my life, once... please.

455
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:39,000
Only this time, please stop just once.

456
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,860
Dam Seo.

457
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:05,480
Why on earth... Why did... Why did you...

458
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,360
I resented you so much.

459
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,250
Because I thought of you as my father,

460
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,810
all those times, I couldn't help but hate you...

461
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,660
It felt so heavy.

462
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,910
Dam Seo.

463
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,840
Now,

464
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,110
I'm going to stop

465
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:47,370
hating you or asking for forgiveness.

466
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,700
No. You can't...

467
00:48:53,660 --> 00:49:00,620
You can't die. You can't... Don't die.

468
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,650
 Dae Gil. 

469
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:26,250
 How could I have gone around the long way? 

470
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:38,820
 From the beginning, I should've asked for forgiveness with my life. 

471
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,240
Dam Seo! Dam Seo!

472
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,130
Dam Seo! Dam Seo!

473
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:22,060
All right! All right!

474
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:29,980
Kill me! Kill me! KILL ME!

475
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,050
 Salvation Pass 

476
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,450
Are you really... going to use that to save this man?

477
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:57,020
You told me before. There are swords that kill people,

478
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,870
and swords that save people.

479
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:07,230
Just one time... We can at least save him one time.

480
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,900
Dam Seo put her life on the line to request it of you.

481
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,390
He's a tenacious one.

482
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,200
Letting this man live...

483
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,130
You are most definitely going to regret it later.

484
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,940
Dam Seo...

Dam Seo...

 Dam Seo...

00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,910
♬   I want to love you.  ♬

491
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,120
♬   Even if it's for a single day   ♬

492
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:38,170
♬   Buried in my longing    ♬

493
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:43,540
♬   You who are in my heart    ♬

494
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:49,330
♬   When I close my eyes and draw you     ♬

495
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:54,960
♬   It feels as if I can grasp you    ♬

496
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:01,320
♬   Shattered by my tears    ♬

497
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,250
♬   You drift away    ♬

498
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:10,790
♬  With your back fading in the distance,   ♬

499
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:16,480
♬   I won't wave goodbye     ♬

500
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:23,970
 I thought I could see your smile after all of this was over, but... 
   ♬   If we are under the same sky  ♬

501
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,580
♬   we will surely meet again  ♬

502
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:32,430
 Dam Seo. If we could make a world where you could smile,  
 ♬   Even if you are away from me briefly     ♬

503
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:38,350
 then at that time, I thought I could see you once again...  
 ♬   And as long as I breathe and my heart beats    ♬

504
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,720
 I'm sorry...  
 ♬   My heart will always     ♬

505
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:47,550
 I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you, Dam Seo...  
 ♬   Be by your side     ♬

♬   me to hold you in my embrace  ♬

508
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:12,310
♬   Don't be hurt again  ♬

509
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:18,330
♬   Because I cannot wipe away your tears  ♬

510
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:26,310
♬   give me your sadness  ♬

511
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:31,840
♬   In your cozy tree leaves  ♬

512
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:37,610
♬   though I may just live full of tears  ♬

513
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:43,470

 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

516
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,080
Current Crown,

517
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,810
I won't stop

518
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,180
at slicing just one finger.

519
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,240
  Who are you? 

520
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,420
My name is Yi In Jwa.

521
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,730
Yi In Jwa?

522
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,740
Aren't you His Highness Big Brother's baduk teacher?

523
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,500
Yes, Your Highness.

524
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,820
Do you know the meaning of the Three-Jong Bloodline? 
  (Three-Jong Bloodline: heir of King Hyojong, Hyeonjong, Sookjong) 

525
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:54,000
As of now there are only three who can ascend the throne: His Highness the Crown Prince, Prince Yeoning,

526
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,660
and Your Highness, Prince Yeonryeong.

527
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,810
So, did you come to win me over?

528
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:10,780
The prince the king holds most dear is not the Crown Prince or Prince Yeoning, it's you, Prince Yeonryeong.

529
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,530
What are you doing right now?

530
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:23,330
What do you think?

531
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:27,570
Would you like to have a seat on the throne?

532
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,740
How insolent of you!

533
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:38,910
Or do you want to turn Joseon upside down with me?

534
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:42,060
You bastard! What nonsense are you saying?!

535
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,070
Go back immediately! Is there anyone out there?

536
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:53,350
Your Highness,

537
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,110
my daughter has died

538
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,630
by the King's hand.

539
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,170
How do you feel?

540
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,700
Do you feel my pain a little bit?

541
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:23,210
My family has been destroyed and I've lost my friend,

542
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,720
along with losing my precious daughter-like disciple— 
DO YOU FEEL MY PAIN AND SADNESS NOW?!

543
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,470
Huh, I guess you can't talk.

544
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:47,410
My Liege. If you kill Prince Yeonryeong now, how will you be able to deal with the consequences?

545
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,740
I guess this much

546
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,690
won't take my pain away, will it?

547
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:17,040
Resent your father, the King, for this.

548
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:25,110
From now on, whether I, Yi In Jwa, die or the King dies,

549
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:31,070
one of us must die in order for this to end.

550
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:47,370
I will definitely slash the King's neck.

551
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,500
Go into the afterlife and await your father.

552
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:03,590
♬   It's okay I can be in pain  ♬

553
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:11,560
♬   I'll just regard this difficulty as a guest,  ♬

554
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:20,090
♬   Crying afterward and even a single laugh  ♬   

555
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:25,400
♬   If you just like me have the same wish  ♬
