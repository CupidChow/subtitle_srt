2
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,170
Dae Gil! Dae Gil!

3
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,000
- Dae Gil! 
 - Dae Gil!

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,720
Dae Gil!

5
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,090
Dae Gil!

6
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,530
So the war is over.

7
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,480
So is the war finally over?

8
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,520
Right.

9
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Dae Gil.

10
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,220
Dae Gil!

11
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,930
Dae Gil, are you okay?

12
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,720
I thought you were dead.  I was about to die with you.

13
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,970
How long was I unconscious?

14
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,130
About a day and a half.

15
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,600
Go on inside and lie down. I'll boil the medicine.

16
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,570
Sir, just as you had said, we were able to live.

17
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,150
The king promised that he would spare us.

18
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,960
What do you mean that came from  His Majesty the King?

19
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,550
It is by the grace of Sir Baek Dae Gil!

20
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,450
Thank you so much, Sir!

21
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,190
Everyone, please return to your hometowns.

22
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,410
Go, not as traitors who took part in a rebellion,

23
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,580
but to live as the people of this country.

24
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,700
Do you understand me?

25
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,290
- Aigoo, thank you, Sir. 
 - Thank you,

26
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,500
Sir. Baek Dae Gil, hoorah!

27
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:30,800
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

28
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,560
 King Yeongjo (Joseon's 21st King) 

29
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,410
From the moment you joined forces with the traitors,

30
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,150
you crossed a river that you cannot uncross. I'm sure you know this.

31
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,830
 Prince Milpung (Yi Tan, great-grandson of Crown Prince Sohyeon) 

32
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,150
Let me ask you one thing.

33
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,330
Was it out of duty or out of your own greed?

34
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,390
Your Majesty! This lowly servant was dense,

35
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,220
and could not see things clearly.

36
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,480
Please, just only take my life.

37
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,570
Didn't I ask,

38
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,640
whether it was out of duty or out of greed.

39
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,890
I have seen

40
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,050
what the people of this nation want.

41
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,100
It was a decision made for the people, you say?

42
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,350
However, because I lacked virtue,

43
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,590
I was unable to recognize someone brimming with his own selfish ambition.

44
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,080
For me

45
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,430
to just cut your neck off right now, won't be sufficient.

46
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,360
Since you severed your ties with the traitor with your own hands,

47
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,380
and to honor the promise I made to Baek Dae Gil,

48
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,420
I will at least spare your life.

49
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,510
However, never

50
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,930
even turn your head again toward the capital.

51
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,590
Your Majesty.

52
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,790
Ten thousand years!

53
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,870
Ten thousand years, Your Majesty!

54
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,530
Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!

55
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,500
 He has caught the treasonous bastard! 

56
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,140
 Yi In Jwa 

57
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,100
His Majesty the King.

58
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:53,940
Thousands of thousands of years. Thousands of thousands of years. Thousands of thousands of years.  Thousands of thousands of years.

59
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,500
Having looked after the state affairs in my place, all this time,

60
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,180
you've all worked hard.

61
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,570
To maintain political stability,

62
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,160
what can't we do, Your Majesty?

63
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,060
Your Majesty, truly I congratulate you on your great victory! 
 Choi Yi Seok (Left State Minister) 

64
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,040
Congratulations.

65
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,920
But,

66
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,320
I have not decided yet

67
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,510
how to deal with the rebel ringleader Yi In Jwa,

68
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,660
That fellow Yi In Jwa, even if  his body is dismembered,  
  (Jo Il Soo, Prime Minister) 

69
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,590
the punishment is not enough. He is a treacherous criminal.

70
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,330
His beheading must be swiftly executed.

71
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,680
Your Majesty, decapitate the criminal

72
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,110
and set him up as an example for the people.

73
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,740
Come in.

74
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,590
It's been so long.

75
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,360
Dae Gil.

76
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,130
Oh my! Have you been well?

77
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,860
You look even prettier when I look with my single eye.

78
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,420
I don't hate you.

79
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,700
When did you hate me?

80
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,860
You did it. You really did it, huh?

81
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,590
Is there news of my father and my master?

82
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,290
Were you looking for me?

83
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,390
What happened in Jeolla Province? What about Park Pil Hyeon?

84
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,690
Look at your father carefully. Nothing escapes me.

85
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,540
A word to the wise is sufficient.

86
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,120
I  know what I'm doing. Right?

87
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,040
Your Majesty, what is all this?

88
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,360
They are the heads of the traitors Jeong Hee Ryang and Park Pil Hyeon, that I picked from the war. What do you think?

89
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,810
Decapitation?

90
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,190
 Jeong Hee Ryang, who had raised an army in Yeongnam, was captured and decapitated. 

91
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,840
 in a sweep by the advancing forces of Seonsan Governor Park Pil Geon and the Gonyang Leader Woo Ha Hyeong. 

92
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,000
Honam's Park Pil Hyeon participated in the rebellion from Jeonju. Before he was able to raise an army he was arrested, then hung.

93
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,700
Now that those who took part in the rebellion are dead and gone,

94
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,710
that fellow Yi In Jwa, probably no longer has any desire to live.

95
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,600
Let's raise Yi In Jwa up again?

96
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,120
Is that possible?

97
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,250
If we don't do that, we're the ones about to get the ax.

98
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,510
The reason that His Majesty hasn't punished that fellow Yi In Jwa yetâ€”

99
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,160
Isn't it to completely clear the rest of the stragglers?

100
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,140
At this rate if a day were to come when

101
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,200
we are discovered to have been secretly in league with that traitor...

102
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,820
Excellency, shouldn't we do something quickly?

103
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,080
For the time I have invested in chasing you, killing you with just a single blow isn't fitting.

104
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,420
Confess... the names of the cabinet members who joined your cause.

105
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,150
For someone like me who will die regardless,

106
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,580
what do I have to regret that I would do such a thing?

107
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,120
I will give you a chance to end your own life.

108
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,260
In the event that you do not commit suicide,

109
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,370
I will have your body dismembered as the people look on.

110
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,450
Cut up the dismembered arms, legs, five viscera and six bowel organs (internal organs),

111
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,050
then have them tossed to the dogs.

112
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,670
You have become a monster.

113
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:07,960
Look at the mirror. In the end, you have also become a monster.

114
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,980
Seeing you call me a monster

115
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,030
is quite a relief.

116
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,070
A monster with a hundred eyes and a thousand ears.

117
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,030
Becoming a monster like Father was,

118
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,730
was my most sincere wish from the very depth of my being.

119
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:51,130
You have exactly until tomorrow morning.

120
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,270
Your Majesty, if Yi In Jwa is to die in this manner,

121
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,250
the evidence of conspiracy between him and the ministers cannot be found.

122
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,050
I don't need things such as evidence.

123
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,200
The cabinet members of the royal court move in accordance with the balance of power.

124
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,830
If I feared them, how could I be regarded as King?

125
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,840
What exactly are you worried about?

126
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,690
If they rise up again, I will trample them.

127
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,410
If they arm themselves with swords and shields to rise up like hornets, all I need to do is slay them.

128
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:37,610
There is no "single blow" in politics. Though the base is cut the roots must be left, so that they can be used.

129
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,800
Wait and see. When Yi In Jwa's whereabouts fade into the unknown,

130
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,340
on that very night, those bastards will be the first to make their move.

131
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,030
 There is no use trying to understand. 

132
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,000
 Kim Che Geon 

133
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,450
It cannot be understood.

134
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,490
Why? What is the reason for the change?

135
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,750
That is the path a king must take.

136
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,420
After shifting back and forth between life and death, at the end of that road, what's left is

137
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,320
only self-assertion and reliance on one's decisions. And probably loneliness.

138
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,550
It is something that ultimately those who are not in that position  cannot do.

139
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,330
Take it.

140
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,150
Who sent this?

141
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,220
I just did as I was told.

142
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,040
 Older Brother, let's meet. 

143
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,760
You go back home first.

144
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,240
He changed. That fellow Hwang Jin Gi, he's changed.

145
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,450
 You said it yourself. 
 (Hwang Jin Gi) 

146
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:05,120
 A nation that was for the people. You would install a king who would take care of his people. 

147
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,800
 But not only are you unable to fill the empty stomachs of the starving people, 

148
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,740
 but also you turned the very flesh on their backs into arrow shields. You did! 

149
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,250
I have found out where Yi In Jwa is being held.

150
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,760
Before that fellow spills, we must act first!

151
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,880
Then... That, Your Excellency, means...

152
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,720
If you escaped, you should've lived as if you were dead. Why did you come here again?

153
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,420
One would have to be able to forget the taste of your sword, Hyungnim.

154
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:07,060
I've only been able to come thus far with the single determination to have your neck, Hyungnim.

155
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,960
Come.

156
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,110
You aren't like before.

157
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,190
Your skills have also improved a lot.

158
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,740
Did you try to pluck Yi In Jwa's neck with your own hands?

159
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,600
Doing so won't cleanse my own sins.

160
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,530
Jin Gi.

161
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,810
Please don't call me like that,

162
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,320
because I think of my mother when you call me like that.

163
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:32,760
I came to receive my punishment. The taste of the sword is just the icing.

164
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,850
This is a man's determination, so let's make this for sure.

165
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:13,150
Why... Why did you spare me?

166
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:20,480
There are just two people I need to spend my entire life atoning for.

167
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,870
First is my wife who met the wrong husband and nearly became a widow.

168
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,840
The second is you.

169
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,240
Spend the rest of your life reflecting on your past actions.

170
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,660
Thank you. Brother.

171
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,730
What happened?

172
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,580
He probably left to go far away. We will not be able to see him again.

173
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:44,560
Master, about Your Majesty. Do you think he could ever return

174
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,060
to His Highness, as he was before?

175
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,110
Don't get your hopes up.

176
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,750
In one's place, enduring the weight placed on one's shoulders, is life.

177
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,910
Have you come to save me or to kill me?

178
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:36,180
Seeing as you are talking this way, it seems you haven't told the King everything yet.

179
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:46,490
Your Excellencies, in the end, cannot throw me away.

180
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,690
Sorry,

181
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,360
but now you must die.

182
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,870
 Current King... 

183
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,190
 That is the path a king must walk. 

184
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,680
 After shifting back and forth between life and death, at the end of that road, what's left is 

185
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,670
 only self-assertion and reliance on one's decisions. 

186
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,400
 And probably loneliness. 

187
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,450
 It is something that ultimately those who are not in that position  cannot do. 

188
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,710
Traitor Yi In Jwa will be dismembered and put on display.

189
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:07,090
Baek Dae Gil, go verify his death with your own eyes.

190
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

191
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,920
Even in the last moment, I guess the throne is something that you still regret not having.

192
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,040
As I said before, I never did such a thing as regretting.

193
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,100
But there is one thing.

194
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,840
Choosing you, Baek Dae Gil, is one of the most stupid pitiful things I've done.

195
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,580
Yi In Jwa, you are quite the oxymoron.

196
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,210
Your words and actions are the epitome of inconsistency.

197
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,570
It is not I who am a sack of inconsistency,

198
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,660
but this nation itself is an oxymoron.

199
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,730
Stop it. Your lastâ€”

200
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:46,530
My last moments are when I die in your hands.

201
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,500
What are you doing?

202
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,840
Wasn't it your wish to end my life?

203
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,110
Don't even think of dying so easily.

204
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,780
Atone for your sins before the people. With tears of penitence.

205
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,700
I am wronged.

206
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,880
For I stood up to save the people, to make a prosperous country with a strong army,

207
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,390
a country that does not cause suffering due to status.

208
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:54,060
For someone such as I, who attempted to found a nation that was for the people,

209
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,950
under what circumstances do I need to die?

210
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,400
Everyone watch out.

211
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,240
I, Yi In Jwa,

212
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,690
one day will...

213
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,970
WILL...

214
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,020
in this rotting land,

215
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,130
more than you all, one million, ten million times more,

216
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,180
be a needed person. You will know!

217
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,410
I, Yi In Jwa,

218
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,650
WILL NEVER DIE!

219
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,120
What is the meaning of this?

220
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,230
The former king bestowed this sword upon me to rescue the people,

221
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,800
and to protect Your Majesty, who are my friend and younger brother.

222
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,470
However, now I want to just live as an ordinary citizen.

223
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,670
The hearts of the people are like reeds in the wind.

224
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,220
So we cannot know what kind of wind will blow or when to shake them.

225
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,740
Please, with your mighty rule,

226
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,540
hold steady the hearts of the people so they do not waver.

227
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,530
I wil

228
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,780
I will remember it always.

229
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,860
Your grace is immeasurable.

230
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:27,150
â™¬  Even if my heart is drained that's the place you are  â™¬

231
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,850
Please remain a commendable person throughout and under the heavens,

232
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,320
as a wise king.
â™¬  Will your heart be with me then?  â™¬

233
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,230
 Are you leaving? Must you really? 
â™¬  Will your heart be with me then?  â™¬

234
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,020
Wherever you go,

235
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,670
please go to a place where I can always find you.
â™¬  Because the words which have not yet been said  remain  â™¬

236
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:58,130
â™¬  Because I cannot live a time without you  â™¬

237
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,500
In the end, that tenacious Yi In Jwa has died in such a manner.

238
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,570
Though we have one less burden to deal with

239
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:22,100
for some reason, a part of me feels...

240
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,060
I don't feel quite placated yet.

241
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,670
I also feel like a bone is stuck in my throat.

242
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,130
Of course, you must feel that way.

243
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,430
If you do not move according to the oath,

244
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,780
I will run as is to the palace.

245
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,910
I will reveal the records of conspiracy between your excellencies and Sire Yi In Jwa.

246
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:05,230
- You wench! 
 - Even if you kill me right here on this spot,

247
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,520
letters have already been sent to dozens of comrades.

248
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,600
The choice is yours, Your Excellencies.

249
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,290
Please choose, Your Excellency.

250
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,310
Will you just die like this,

251
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,990
or will you at least struggle to stay alive?

252
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,750
Yi In Jwa. In the end it was that fellow who had a measured hold over us.

253
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,970
I will meet with Her Majesty the Queen Dowager.

254
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,050
Your Excellency, please head to the prisons.

255
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,400
Your Majesty the Queen Dowager, you must take a decisive step.

256
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,770
What is there to fear now? 
 ( Great Queen Dowager Gyeongsoon, King Gyeongjong's second queen, Queen Seonui) )

257
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:12,050
Your lowly servants will put our lives at stake to protect you, Your Highness.

258
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
You must

259
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,530
surely succeed.

260
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,930
When was the Court Tasting Lady changed?

261
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,900
Taste the food again.

262
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,270
Why are you hesitating?

263
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,330
I told you to taste the food again.

264
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,890
Y-Your Majesty!

265
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,020
I have committed a sin worthy of death!

266
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,700
Y-Your Majesty.

267
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,620
Please spare me.

268
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,550
Who is it?

269
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,840
Who instigated you to do it?

270
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,410
Stop!

271
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,030
You bastards!

272
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,830
Since I can appease My Liege's soul even like this,

273
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,010
I won't have any regret.

274
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,830
San Gil.

275
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,630
I am sorry,

276
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,140
Your Majesty.

277
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,970
Current King,

278
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,820
you'll spend the rest of your life alone

279
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,520
and die lonely.

280
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,900
Crown Prince...

281
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,100
Crown Prince!

282
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,170
Haeng.

283
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,220
Arrest them!

284
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,850
What are you doing?

285
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,000
What's this?! Let go!

286
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,330
Let go! What are you doing?

287
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,980
Why, you bastards?

288
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,280
Who has taken part in poisoning the Crown Prince?

289
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,420
Poison?

290
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,050
That's utterly unreasonable, Your Majesty!

291
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,750
We have been wronged, Your Majesty!

292
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,020
Do I have to cut off an arm and a leg

293
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,890
for you all to tell me the truth?

294
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,600
Your Majesty,

295
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,200
we have nothing to do with this incident!

296
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,100
Do you know who this wench is?

297
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,720
That... That is...

298
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,490
Look very carefully!

299
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,990
Is she the court lady who goes in and out of the Dowager Queen's quarters?

300
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,340
Tell me now.

301
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,650
Then...

302
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,980
I will spare your lives.

303
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,190
At the Dowager Queen's quarters,

304
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,710
I have seen her a few times.

305
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,860
Behind you all

306
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,940
was the Dowager Queen.

307
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,050
Why?

308
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,150
If you choose the Dowager Queen,

309
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,490
do you think she can save your lives?

310
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,350
The criminals and their associates,

311
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,280
their relatives, in-laws,

312
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,920
and even their third cousins. Have them all arrested and brought in.

313
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,210
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

314
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,020
Your Majesty!!

315
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,630
Your Majesty!!

316
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,100
Search thoroughly!

317
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,560
Yes!

318
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,490
Why did you have to

319
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,970
go that far?

320
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,810
Are you asking because you don't know?

321
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:29,050
I have not forgotten, not even once,

322
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,910
that day.

323
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,400
Now,

324
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,170
do you understand my pain?!

325
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,100
Confine Her Highness the Dowager Queen to the royal investigation quarters.

326
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,850
Also, if she takes even one step out of the royal investigating quarters,

327
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,910
at that instant, you must cut her neck.

328
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,030
Do you understand?

329
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

330
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:55,790
Summon Royal Secretaries and all of the chroniclers.

331
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,590
Regarding the traitor Yi In Jwa's war,

332
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,500
bring all the drafts you have prepared for the record up to now.

333
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,210
However, Your Majesty!

334
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:14,930
For the drafts prepared for the Annals, in order to prevent the writings from disappearing in history,

335
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,990
it is the law that the King shall not read the drafts personally.

336
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,370
What? Is there a law that is above even the king?

337
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,640
On the post-factum of me, the Annals, or the Journal of the Royal Secretariat,

338
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,980
no records of the traitors must remain.

339
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:47,030
What are you doing, not bringing me that immediately?

340
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,110
  I can't tolerate even one hair of you, bastard. 

341
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:10,120
 Disappear without a trace from Joseon, Yi In Jwa. 

342
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,880
 Drag all of them out! 

343
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,300
The Crown Prince has passed away.

344
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,410
The young Crown Prince? How?

345
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,490
it was poison.

346
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:50,200
It seems Yi In Jwa, the Sorons, and even the Dowager Queen schemed together.

347
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,270
Yi In Jwa.

348
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,160
Then the whole family who were arrested before...

349
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:03,110
He arrested all of the relatives and in-laws who were related to the Sorons.

350
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:09,120
He is thinking  not only to bring about a disaster that wipes out a whole family but also to root out any seed of that family.

351
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,000
No matter what, I have to meet His Majesty.

352
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,580
Don't get involved.

353
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,530
Do you know how it feels to have lost a child?

354
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:27,010
Right now, you can neither persuade His Majesty nor comfort him.

355
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,660
- Butâ€” 
  - Also, you have already left the king's side.

356
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,070
Stay put.

357
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:40,550
Don't take part in the matters of royal court... anymore.

358
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,380
It is now time for us to leave.

359
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,990
Dae Gil!

360
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,710
Dae Gil!

361
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,830
Hello.

362
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,590
Hello! Welcome!

363
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,210
Welcome!

364
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:05,150
Welcome. They say that even though you're carrying bullets in your body, you can live a long life.

365
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:36,130
 Current King, you'll spend the rest of your life alone and die lonely. 

366
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:41,280
 Now,  do you understand my pain? 

367
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:52,560
 The King sitting on the throne has no time to feel such sadness. 

368
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:58,250
 Nor should he do so. 

369
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,610
Your Majesty, you called for us?

370
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,720
How is the public sentiment?

371
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:17,250
Even though there are some  people who are still sad about the Crown Prince's death, generally it's calm.

372
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,170
But...

373
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,180
Is there anyone in Joseon who does not know of Baek Dae Gil?

374
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,560
If you are hungry, he gives you rice, and if you need money, he lends you money.

375
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,880
He's a hundred times better than the king, of course.

376
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,370
By the way, they say that fellow Baek Dae Gil is of the king's bloodline.

377
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:45,210
I have heard that rumor as well! Here. Have some more to drink.

378
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,200
Baek Dae Gil.

379
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,790
Your Majesty, it's difficult to say this,

380
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:06,080
but the people in the eight provinces revere the fellow called Baek Dae Gil as a king.

381
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,450
We can't just stand and watch, Your Majesty!

382
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:15,150
That's right. Please have Baek Dae Gil arrested and brought in, and punish him severely.

383
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:21,470
You have to nip the source before such a traitor reveals his traitorous mind.

384
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,820
Are you guys being sincere?

385
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:33,640
I must nip the source before such a traitor reveals his traitorous mind? Then I must do so!

386
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:40,400
Immediately, arrest the fellow called Baek Dae Gil and behead him!

387
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,540
Why? Isn't this what you all wanted?

388
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,150
 -  What are you going to do if I go against you?  
- Really! 

389
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,140
 Seriously, he is worth 100 nyangs, but why am I worthy only 20 nyangs? 

390
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:30,260
 Why? Are you curious about that as well, Your Highness? 

391
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,240
 Your Highness? 

392
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:41,870
 Here, have a glass. 

393
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:50,010
â™¬   It's all right, I've never let you go    â™¬

394
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,890
â™¬  Please    â™¬

395
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,600
 - Don't run. You'll get hurt.  
â™¬   Don't pound on your heart alone    â™¬ 

396
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:05,600
â™¬   Even if fate falls behind the world    â™¬

397
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:11,660
â™¬   This place for you is my spot as well     â™¬

398
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,980
By the way, who are you to block my way like this?

399
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,660
â™¬    After a long way, we will definitely meet again   â™¬

400
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,960
How about living here?

401
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,030
Everyone is so busy eating and living that the days are chaotically flying by.

402
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:54,660
Then you have no room to incubate other thoughts.

403
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:02,130
That's right. I came here today to kill you.

404
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:12,200
I heard there is someone who openly exercises power, like a king, even though there is someone on the throne.

405
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,630
That's why I came here.

406
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,580
Kill me.

407
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:23,740
The public sentiment is not something I can do anything about

408
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,970
The public sentiment kindled in the market streets has begun to bother the King's mind in the palace.

409
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,890
I have nothing to say even if it's called treason.

410
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,980
Tell me what's in your heart.

411
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:54,070
In your deep mind, have you ever shouted you are a king yourself?

412
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,300
I don't know.

413
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,900
If you didn't share the blood  with me as a brother,

414
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:06,610
or if  you were not at least my real brother,

415
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,500
I don't know... what I would have done.

416
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:16,720
Right now, do you know what you said means?

417
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,870
Everyone is telling me that I should be king.

418
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,720
They become earnest for me to be a king.

419
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,500
However,

420
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,390
even if I were to drag you out and  come to sit on the throne,

421
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,620
indeed, do you think they'd like it?

422
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,700
The people are the ones who know about the natural law and reason.

423
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,730
Because I am an ordinary person like them, that's why they are more comforted and admire me more.

424
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:51,620
I mean, it's not at all that they really want me to overturn this country.

425
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,440
Why aren't you confident in your position?

426
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,030
Go down first.

427
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,230
How are you going to live from now on?

428
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,220
I am asking not as your king,

429
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,460
but as your brother.

430
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,420
I am one of the many people of this land.

431
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,850
I will work when I have to, play when I can,

432
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:42,610
and sometimes gamble as well. Probably, that's how I'll live.

433
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:48,300
Right. You had that kind of character too.

434
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,620
You used to be simple and innocent, and didn't have any of the worries of the world.

435
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,500
There was a time like that.

436
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,820
I suddenly... long for those days

437
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:10,260
So does this humble subject.

438
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,480
Will those days come again?

439
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:17,850
When we gamble together with a smile.

440
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,470
Those days... I mean.

441
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,040
Are you planning on leaving?

442
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,300
Will you come back?

443
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,990
My body is already old,

444
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:49,590
and so I don't think I will be able to be a source of strength to you.

445
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,040
This throne

446
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,740
is becoming more lonely.

447
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,700
It's delicious.

448
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,600
Catch it!

449
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,000
Come here, you punk!

450
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,030
Catch it!

451
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,020
I got it!

452
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,030
Oh! This one is ripe.

453
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,530
I haven't seen Dae Gil all day.

454
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:10,050
Yeah, I haven't seen him all day either.

455
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,540
Where did he go?

456
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,960
Could his disease be recurring?

457
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,810
Hey, he's getting married tomorrow. I don't think so.

458
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,500
Look at him! I knew this would happen.

459
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,290
This punk left his house again without controlling himself.

460
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,310
I told you that's not it.

461
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:34,000
Then, what should I do? Tomorrow is the wedding day... without a bridegroom...

462
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,440
Don't worry.

463
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,610
I'll find him before you finish cutting those onions.

464
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,700
Cut this watermelon nicely, huh?

465
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,500
- Aigoo, that punk! 
 -  This punk!

466
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,290
Without coming to his senses...

467
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,840
It has been a while.

468
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,860
Please line up.

469
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,020
Aigoo, it's been a while.

470
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,310
Welcome!

471
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,810
Wait, wait.

472
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,100
Are you Kim Sae Ttol from Dan Village?

473
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,140
Well... do I have some problem...

474
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,930
Problem? There's a ton of problems!

475
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,650
How many days have you been here now?

476
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:15,700
Every day you drink and lose all your money gambling. Why do you keep coming back?

477
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,500
You should not keep living from hand to mouth like this.

478
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,600
Please leave.

479
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,920
Well. Yes.

480
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,380
Welcome!

481
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,300
Do you have to see it?

482
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,610
I need to see it.

483
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,500
You are busy.

484
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,970
No. Is it possible he went to the gambling den?

485
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,460
That punk who'll marry,

486
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,410
why would he go to the gambling den unless he's gone crazy?

487
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,310
Ah, look at who is here!

488
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,970
Of course we came because those two are going to marry.

489
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,930
I can't miss this kind of day.

490
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:04,630
Hong Mae. You brought so much stuff on such a good day.

491
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,330
What kind of trouble are you going to stir up?

492
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,800
What do you mean, trouble?

493
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,650
Can't you see behind? I brought all that.

494
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,880
They're leaving for somewhere far. I wonder how they'll be able to carry all that.

495
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,010
Leaving? Are you serious?

496
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,640
They can't live here for thousand years or ten thousand years. Now they need to leave after saying goodbye.

497
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,200
Where are they going?

498
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,960
Have you decided where?

499
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,260
I heard it's a very good place.

500
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,220
- Grandpa, is that right?  
 - Of course.

501
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:38,100
It's the place where Dae Gil will go. It must be much better place than here.

502
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,860
I guess I brought it all for nothing.  I'll just take it all back.

503
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,110
No, what are you talking about?

504
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,700
Bring it here.

505
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,150
Anyhow, you brought it.

506
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,080
Let's go.

507
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,490
Welcome!

508
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,200
Aigoo.

509
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,400
He has no sense.

510
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,490
That's enough. Give it here.

511
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,160
Look closely from here.

512
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,260
Still, I'm getting it.

513
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,150
By the way, you punk... If your father gave an exhibition, you should react somehow!

514
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,820
Why do you have that expression on your face?   
  (Kim Gwang Taek, Kim Che Geon's son) 

515
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,280
Has anyone ever survived your training?

516
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,350
Did I kill you or what?

517
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,780
It's because I'm your son that I'm able to stick it out this long. In generalâ€”

518
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,140
Of course, someone has. Someone who looked exactly like you, who didn't listen at all  and was a fool.

519
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:58,020
Really? Is he dead or alive?

520
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,050
He became a Great Tiger.

521
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:10,760
He honored the King's order above himself.

522
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,050
Under him, he saved the people of this country.

523
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,320
 Back!

This arrogant little brat talking to me in banmal  (informally) !

533

â™¬  Drenched in the mournful cascading despair  â™¬

538
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:34,860
â™¬  In a fate which even the moonlight hides  â™¬

539
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:40,700
â™¬  A shining beam of light flickers and  â™¬

540
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:47,000
â™¬  It is you infecting my heart with love.  â™¬

541
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:56,200
â™¬  Will I be able to see time stop then?  â™¬

542
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:05,480
â™¬  Will your heart be with me then?  â™¬

â™¬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  â™¬

â™¬  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  â™¬

545
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,430
â™¬  Because the words which have not yet been said remain  â™¬

546
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:31,780
â™¬  Because I cannot live in a time without you  â™¬
