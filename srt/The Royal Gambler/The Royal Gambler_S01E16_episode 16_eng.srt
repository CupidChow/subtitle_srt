00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,930
 Episode 16 
So? Why are you telling me this?

2
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,750
What changes if Royal Consort Sook is my mother?

3
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,010
You still don't know?

 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

5
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:10,110
Baek Dae Gil, you are  not Baek Man Geum's child.

6
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,850
What in the world...

7
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,070
The current king. Your father is not Baek Man Geum.

8
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,990
It's the current king.

9
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,030
This nation's monarch.

10
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,250
The monarch is my father?

11
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,410
Father?

12
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,750
What happened?

13
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,290
How did it come to this?

14
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,570
Have you forgotten?

15
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,350
My relationship with you ended that night.

16
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,490
It's not over!

17
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,250
How can you start and end it on your terms alone?

18
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,110
I have now just found my path.

19
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,770
Is killing people

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,030
your path?

21
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,450
Making sure that there aren't any more unjust actions

22
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,910
so that none is cornered and trampled again.

23
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,310
Getting rid of all the evil people in this world, this is my work.

24
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,130
How

25
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,290
did this happen? Who made you like this?

26
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,630
You're the one who made me like this.

27
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,670
What?

28
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,450
Are you crazy? How can you say my father's the king?

29
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:58,050
It's the truth. You are Yeong Soo, the 6-month premature baby who was kicked out of the palace.

30
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,070
That's your real name.

31
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,530
Then what does that make my father, Baek Man Geum?

32
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,230
Don't test my patience.

33
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:41,330
The prince named Yeong Soo born in the year of Gyeyu (1693) on the 6th day of the 10th month became ill and died.

34
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,410
That is how it's recorded in the Royal Secretariat's Journal, so it is not to be doubted.

35
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,910
   

36
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,370
That night, if I hadn't met you,

37
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,770
I wouldn't have known it was my teacher who killed my father.

38
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:11,690
If I hadn't met you that night, I would have died and disappeared.

39
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,490
I wouldn't have  been shaken either.

40
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:21,290
How can there be such faulty logic?

41
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,710
Then how can you wear such an expression

42
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,570
in front of a murderer?

43
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,590
If we meet again,

44
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,730
I will arrest you and pin your crime upon you.

45
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,850
If we meet again, please arrest me without faltering.

46
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,910
At that time, the man I once served as my teacher

47
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,890
will be gone and dead as well.

48
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:00,870
Seol Im!  Our Seol Im is here.  How are you? Are you hurt?

49
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,810
Grandpa, were you worried?

50
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:10,130
Don't even speak of it.  Dae Gil was dragged to the police bureau.

51
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,870
Gramps, about Dae Gil.  He caught Dog Blade and cleared his wrongful accusation.

52
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,850
Is that true?

53
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,730
- Of course.
- Aigo.

54
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,870
That's a relief. Such a relief!

55
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,510
But your face doesn't look good.

56
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,070
I am a gambler indeed.

57
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,810
But I'm quite the master among face readers as well.

58
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,290
Who ever said such thing as you having the fate of the Grand White Tiger Kill?

59
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,310
 Grand White Tiger Kill: most inauspicious fate courting savage deaths to those in the vicinity. 

60
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,870
 Though you are talented, your face courts a peach evil (lust). 

61
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,990
 What? 

62
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,530
 Rather than the evil of lust, perhaps it's the Grand White Tiger Kill.  

63
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:12,750
That mean wench Mother Hwanggu played a joke on you to put a nail in a tender heart.

64
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,330
That rotten wench.

65
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,750
What?

66
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,150
Some stagehorse evil or some peach evil.

67
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,670
Those talks exist in the pillars of fate but they cannot be read by physiognomy.

68
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:32,190
Actually, our Seol Im has quite a nice countenance.

69
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,070
Are you telling the truth?

70
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,630
Of course.  Though your countenance isn't as good as our Dae Gil's.

71
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,670
Still, it's a countenance that does not lack anything.

72
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,150
What about Dae Gil's? What does his face say?

73
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,050
He has the face to become a king. The monarch!

74
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,770
What?

75
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:06,930
Want to know why?  Oh, but why is that rascal taking so long?

76
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,570
 Born from the same womb, hence you and Prince Yeoning are brothers. 

77
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,710
 Hyungnim. (Brother) 

78
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,190
Raise your head.

79
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,930
 That person is my biological father? 

80
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,890
You've cleared the wrongful accusation,

81
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,690
but you did not keep your promise to return by Haeshi  (9â€“11 pm) .

82
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,610
The criminal you had to catch alive... You even made him die.

83
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,550
So the two of you will have to pay for that consequence.

84
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,910
What will you do? Will you accept the punishment or listen to me?

85
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,510
Please issue your order, Your Majesty.

86
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:22,830
Lee In Jwa met that traitor from the Jeong clan, you say?

87
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:29,950
Then what do you think would happen? What do you think you would need to do?

88
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,630
You two go capture Lee In Jwa.

89
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,050
Father,

90
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,510
last time, when an assassin intruded and  you clearly knew of Lee In Jwa's involvement,

91
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,690
you still did not take any action.

92
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,350
It was not the right time then.

93
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,570
He already lost at the moment he sent  the inexperienced girl Dam Seo.

94
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,050
But it's different now.

95
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,050
Dog Blade is dead and Lee In Jwa also knows the identity of the mastermind  Jeong.

96
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,030
So he has ample energy now.

97
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,990
One should not show ferocious canine teeth easily to a beast with a horn.

98
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,450
That is the logic of the world.

99
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:32,450
But what will happen if that horn continues to grow?

100
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,010
If a tiger lets his guard down and gets slugged by those horns, in order to avoid death...

101
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,520
what must he do?

102
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,080
Bite it, pull it, and rip it apart to get rid of that horn.

103
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,000
Right now

104
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,760
that time has come.

105
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,790
How much did you hear?

106
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,460
All of it.  I heard everything.

107
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,670
If you heard everything, then...

108
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,780
Hyungnim... that I'm your hyungnim.

109
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,330
Even so, I can't call you Hyungnim.

110
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:54,550
This is the palace, and I am the Prince by birth.

111
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,600
Are you all right?

112
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,720
Have you been freed now from the false charges?
 Royal Consort Sook of the Choi Clan 

113
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,490
 Is this truly 

114
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,560
Mo... Mother.

115
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,260
I'm sorry.

116
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,120
I should have sought you out you sooner.

117
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,250
Please forgive me.

118
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,380
Your foolish mother... please forgive your foolish mother.

119
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,690
It's still... very confusing.

120
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,330
Another time... I will come see you again.

121
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,220
Why didn't you answer?

122
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,680
Didn't Mother ask for forgiveness?

123
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,220
When you don't know what's going on, you shouldn't be demanding.

124
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,550
The mother that I thought was dead is alive.

125
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:28,800
And the brother that knew the truth kept his mouth shut.

126
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,910
That is...

127
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,590
that is...

128
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,300
because I wasn't prepared to accept it yet.

129
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,210
I feel the same way.

130
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,800
If Your Highness feels that way about gaining a hyung,

131
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,590
then how do you think I feel about gaining Your Highnesses brother and mother?

132
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,910
I need time, and a lot of it.

133
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,630
Where are you going?

134
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,050
A personal matter is a personal matter but a royal command is a royal command.

135
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,890
 A clansman of Jeong will annihilate the Joseon of Yi. 

136
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,620
 That can't be.  Not as long as I, Lee In Jwa, am here. 

137
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,320
 Jeonggamnok (Records of Jeonggam). 

138
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:39,890
My Liege, two eunuchs that guard the king have gone missing since yesterday.

139
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,820
But I've been told they have entered the palace and are accompanying Kim Che Geon just now.

140
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,150
Eunuchs brought Kim Che Geon?

141
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:03,370
 So the king has secretly summoned Kim Che Geon.  The king has. 

142
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:10,810
 Lee In Jwa, meeting like this is good for neither of us. 

143
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:18,750
 If the two of us meet, the current king will draw his sword. 

144
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,170
If he knows I and the Jeong clansman are in contact...

145
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,540
The current king won't stay still.

146
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:35,470
 Has the  king already drawn his sword?  Has there been any word from Mother Hwanggu yet?

147
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,580
Hurry.

148
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,450
The king.

149
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,970
The king is going to draw his sword.

150
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,100
I will mobilize at my will and Mu Myeong, you confirm the movements of the police bureau.

151
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,290
And go to Wolhyanggak to check on the development of the various ministers.

152
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,150
Yes, My Liege.

153
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,090
Boss Hong, do you know where Baek Dae Gil's house is?

154
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,260
It won't be that hard to find.

155
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,170
Watch Baek Dae Gil's house closely.  See if there is any suspicious activity.

156
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,750
Will do.

157
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,150
That tiger brother is back?
 Hwang Jin Gi 

158
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,810
- Then I should . . .
- Warrior Hwang.

159
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,940
You have someone else to meet.

160
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,130
Oh my.

161
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,200
Jeez.

162
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,290
Hey, he's coming.

163
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,820
So, things went well?  How did it go?

164
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,450
I owe my life to you again.  Thank you.

165
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,870
Ah, I'm hungry.

166
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,100
Oh, you're hungry?  I'll get it ready in a moment.

167
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,390
Why aren't you eating?  You're just going to watch?

168
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,130
We already ate a lot.

169
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,430
Just how much did you eat?

170
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,620
Normally, in a relationship between a man and a woman,

171
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,500
before you fart, you belch first.

172
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,330
Next time, you should just fart as well.

173
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,990
Oh, Grandfather!

174
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:05,880
I know you're happy to see me, but do you have to fling the spoon before I even sit down?

175
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,370
You should serve food at the dinner table, shouldn't you?

176
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,090
Master!

177
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:34,490
Every time you wrap something up, another spoon is added.

178
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,090
So this person is...

179
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,230
You mean he is the master who made you mature?

180
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,380
- Yes. He fed me, gave the place to sleep, saved me, and...  
  - ...&nbsp;cooked for you.

181
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,730
Cook... No, that's not it.

182
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,390
Slow down! You look like you're eating white rice  for the first time in your life.

183
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,680
It is the first time. Since you went down, it's the first time.

184
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,230
It's bothersome. You had to cook the rice and make the side dishes.

185
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,630
Then what have you been eating?

186
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,730
Well... Fish, rabbit...

187
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,550
something like that...

188
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,610
Master. If you don't have a place to go, you may live here together with us.

189
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,830
Please do so. I'll cook hot meals every day.

190
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:39,600
No, thanks. Hey, I have a house and wife and kids, so don't worry about me.

191
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,070
By the way,  you punk, you're really fast.

192
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,920
As soon as you came down the mountain, you just got a girl first.

193
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
It's not like that.

194
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,240
Because our Dae Gil is really handsome,

195
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,390
even women from 10 li  (about 2.5 miles)  away would know it somehow.

196
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,950
I'm telling you, that's not it.

197
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,680
What do you mean that's not it?  It looks like that's it.

198
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,790
Why did you hit me?

199
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,110
You deserve to be hit, so you got hit.

200
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,240
By the way, it's really delicious.

201
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,310
- Is it delicious?  
 - Yeah. It is.

202
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,630
 If Kim Che Geon came back, I'm sure he'd look for Baek Dae Gil first. 

203
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,600
 Watch carefully if there is anything slightly suspicious about them. 

204
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,210
 I don't see any suspicious sign. 

205
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,040
 Make yourself familiar with the face of the man Kim Jeong Yeol and his house. 

206
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,010
 Make sure to be cautious to avoid being seen. 

207
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,560
What's the matter?

208
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,360
It's just my unnecessary mistake.

209
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,170
Then I'm leaving.

210
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,690
Excuse me.

211
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,840
Has  Mother Hwanggu come back yet?

212
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,130
She left a while ago.

213
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,900
Has she returned yet?

214
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,800
My Liege, there is no sign of movement at all.

215
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,180
No sign of movement at all?

216
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,910
None.

217
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,580
How about your side?

218
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,090
Well, they were eating, laughing, talking... They looked like they were having a good time.

219
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,270
Is it a rosebay flower? It's really pretty.

220
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,380
We also call it  azalea. 

221
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,840
There is a legend that, after the Qing emperor lost his country due to his ministers' treason,

222
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,180
he turned into a little cuckoo bird.

223
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:51,180
So, this azalea also symbolizes the king's tears of blood.

224
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,600
 Are you planning on making him shed tears of blood? 

225
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,730
 The wine made with the azaleas atop Mount Mokmyeon 

226
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,560
 is indeed like none other. 

227
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,980
 I will invite you over sometime. 

228
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:13,430
Warrior Hwang, did you check the man named Kim Jeong Yeol's movements?

229
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,240
That man looks like he is feeling unwell.

230
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,300
Do you have to pluck such a man's neck once and for all?

231
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:30,440
That man is the very traitor Jeong who'd ruin the Yi dynasty.

232
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,360
If that man stabs me in the back,

233
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,050
you... slash his neck.

234
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,980
But if Jeong Hee Ryang joins me tonight

235
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,840
this Joseon will be upside down

236
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,290
tomorrow.

237
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,340
At Sulshi (7â€“9 pm), when the azalea wine is being made,

238
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,270
follow the scent of flowers.

239
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,020
The way to come here was very good.

240
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,860
Why are you standing like this?

241
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,550
Ah, I think I got lost and came to the wrong house.

242
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,120
No.

243
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,980
You found the right place.

244
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,210
Lee In Jwa! You... are finished now.

245
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,230
 You two go capture Lee In Jwa. 

246
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,710
 Your Majesty. May I speak one word? 

247
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,280
 What is it? 

248
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,610
  I thinkI met the traitor Jeong. 

249
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:14,170
 Two of them met and seemed to agree to a secret meeting. 

250
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,470
 So? 

251
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,770
  Since they are very shrewd, 

252
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,470
 if we approach them after they let their guards down, 

253
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,160
 we can capture Lee In Jwa and Jeong as well. 

254
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,700
 Also,  no one except  Your Majesty, Prince Yeoning, the eunuchs and me, 

255
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,900
 should know this fact. 

256
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,550
I'm not sure if the traitor Jeong escaped shrewdly,

257
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,220
Lee In Jwa, you... are finished now.

258
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,930
Your Majesty, we failed to capture the traitor Jeong.

259
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,860
But we arrested Lee In Jwa and his ring.

260
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,210
How did his face look?

261
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,220
I mean his stares.

262
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,980
Did he keep his composure?

263
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,650
Looking at you in there, I feel bad somehow.

264
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,980
I don't need your sympathy.

265
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,100
So enjoy yourself.

266
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,050
Right.  As soon as the sun rises, your criminal  interrogation will start.

267
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,900
Anything you'd like to say in advance?

268
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,150
Your Highness.

269
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,830
What exactly are the crimes you have us imprisoned for?

270
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,290
Actually, I may have to stay up all night for that cause.

271
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,850
Since there are not just one or two crimes.

272
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,360
You suit this place well.

273
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,550
Well, see you tomorrow.

274
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,820
My life came back from the dead anyway.

275
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,020
I'll just sleep here.

276
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,690
My Liege, what happens now?

277
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,110
Don't worry.

278
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,820
Even if the skies collapse, there will be a hole left.
 (proverb: there is always an escape from any predicament) 

279
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,430
Don't let your guards down.  That Hwang Jin Gi,

280
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,880
can burst out of here if he wants to.

281
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,680
That won't happen.

282
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,060
Lee In Jwa has not given up.

283
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,370
If he leaves like this, he will inevitably lose everything.

284
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:21,130
He will not leave this place unless he's released on an innocent verdict.

285
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,890
A day like today, I'd like to have a cup of wine.

286
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,820
But I have many matters to tend to tomorrow morning.

287
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,970
We'll meet again then.

288
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,750
You've finally put that Lee In Jwa who's caused you to grind your teeth every night in jail.

289
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,250
Do you feel more relaxed?

290
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,960
I think what you said was true, Master.

291
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,520
If my life's goal was simply revenge on him,

292
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,280
it would have been too lonely.

293
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,660
Due to the heart feeling so empty.

294
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,350
But, Master...

295
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,210
you've known that all along, haven't you?

296
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,230
What?

297
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,540
Me.  Who I am.

298
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,510
 You resemble him. 

299
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,890
 You resemble someone I know. 

300
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,200
Is that important?

301
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:42,890
As I taught you, if there's one thing I realized,

302
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,500
it's that you are

303
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,450
someone even without me,

304
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:51,620
who would have come to this somehow.

305
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,580
That's enough, so don't worry about it.

306
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,210
Since nothing will change anyway.

307
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,250
 Father... 

308
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,870
 I am doing a good job, right? 

309
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,570
Sister!

310
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:38,210
Lord Lee In Jwa was captured.

311
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:50,440
Your Highness, Lee In Jwa has been arrested and imprisoned.

312
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,690
Lee In Jwa has been arrested?

313
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,550
What was the crime?

314
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,630
Treason.

315
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,970
The king is mobilizing personally.

316
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,790
Hwang Jin Gi who once worked in the Office of Declaration,

317
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,560
for the crime of royal prison escape and attempted murder,

318
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,960
interference with a government official in the performance of his duties,

319
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,490
Mu Myeong of lowest class origin with 9th junior ranking as a Nangcheong officer,

320
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,250
the crime of murder by poisoning and intimidation and blackmail,

321
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,400
Mother Hwanggu,

322
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,760
true name Jeong Yong Seon, bribery and conspiracy,

323
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,630
and...

324
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,370
Lee In Jwa.

325
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,520
Your Highness, if a crime becomes real just by your sticking some name onto it,

326
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,440
how will the people of this nation survive?

327
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,860
You've committed too many crimes.

328
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,640
So I've made a special preparation.

329
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,370
First, the crimes of murder and instigating murder.

330
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,600
Second, the crime of bribery assignment.

331
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,340
Third, the crime of moral violation

332
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,350
and delusion of the world and deception of the people.

333
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,710
Fourth, the crime of contempt for the foundation of the state (heir to throne).

334
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,400
Fifth...

335
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,010
the crime of plotting treason

336
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,060
with the traitor of Jeongchoong Year.

337
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,510
How is it?

338
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,550
The subject is missing.  You've only named the crimes.

339
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,780
Would you give me a chance to rebut

340
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,590
those criminal charges?

341
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,520
Go ahead and make your counterarguments  if you have any.

342
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,640
First, the crimes of murder and instigating murder:.

343
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,620
Chief of chartered merchants, Swindler Golsa and Dog Blade.

344
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,790
That I killed them,

345
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,330
or that I commissioned their murders.  Have you the proof?

346
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,700
Second.  Bribery assignment.

347
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,640
In bribery, if someone gives it, someone receives it.

348
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,060
So someone gave a bribe,

349
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,340
and where in the world is the one who received the bribe?

350
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,220
Third.

351
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:02,440
Moral violation and delusion of the world and deception of the people, did you say?

352
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,700
Those who gamble, those who smoke, those who drink.

353
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,660
If those become absent,

354
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,040
then the gambling dens, the wine, and the tobacco will disappear.

355
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,500
Have a look outside.

356
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,840
You can pin that crime on anyone, not just me.

357
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,420
Fourth.  Foundation of state (heir to throne)?

358
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,970
I committed contempt against the Crown Prince?

359
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,410
His Royal Highness and I go way back.

360
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,420
He is my disciple in baduk.

361
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:41,800
What exactly is the crime of me listening to his worries?

362
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,230
Your attempt to meet the traitor of the Jeong clan.

363
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,620
How do you explain that?

364
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,510
I tried to find the man who stirred a treason some 20 years ago.

365
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,310
And my intention was actually to hand his head to His Majesty.

366
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,120
But since you arrested me,

367
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,240
I've lost my golden opportunity, haven't I?

368
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,960
What did you say?!

369
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,300
You.

370
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,590
What's with the useless yakking?

371
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,280
Huh?

372
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,070
Long time no see, baduk teacher.

373
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,820
I am deeply embarrassed with my appearance, Your Majesty.

374
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,750
Who is it?

375
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,210
That traitor of the Jeong clan.

376
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:19,800
Jeong Nam Sok.  Jeong Joong Taek.  Jeong Hyeon Seok.

377
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,330
Jeong Seok Ho,  Jeong Gwon Yu, Jeong Seung Gyu.

378
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:28,220
Jeong Hae Soo, Jeong Yeong Cheol.

379
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:37,210
If we should call out all the Jeongs across the eight provinces, it will take all night.

380
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,650
Would you still like to hear it, Your Majesty?

381
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,770
On midday in two days, have this man killed by dismemberment.

382
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,630
Your Majesty, but what about the royal interrogation?

383
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:04,250
Royal interrogation?  What is the use of the likes of that on a traitor?

384
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,660
You're finished.

385
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,760
Treason?

386
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,220
Well, isn't it?

387
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,230
Lee In Jwa made contact with that high traitor Jeong.

388
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,490
Even that alone makes him a high traitor.

389
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,790
But to say it isn't treason?

390
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:44,760
Why, are you complicit in Lee In Jwa's activities?

391
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,060
It isn't treason, of course.

392
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,350
What did you just say?

393
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:06,150
Your Majesty, what happened overnight was not treason by final means.

394
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,350
Where in the world is there treason without swords drawn?

395
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,910
Did that man draw a sword?

396
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,640
You're...

397
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,760
able to say that after seeing this painting?

398
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,000
Though it's not that I don't know the meaning of that painting, it is really only a painting.

399
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,590
Though an ill intent is there, we cannot know who painted it.

400
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,570
Why, you're...

401
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,200
What are you doing right now!

402
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,980
Whether it's treason or not, how is that so important?

403
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,360
I issued the order.  I did!

404
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,490
You should be out looking for the traitor Jeong

405
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,690
but see that pitiful way you talk!

406
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:24,580
The offenders will be beheaded in two days at Oshi (11 am to 1 pm).

407
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:31,860
You guys mobilize wittingly or else you will not be spared.

408
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,150
Did you comprehend that?

409
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,180
Hwon.

411
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,980
Yes, Royal Father.

412
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,860
Hwon, massage my shoulders.

413
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,180
 Prince Yeonryeong (Lee Hwon, Sukjong's sixth son) 
Yes.

414
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,560
Royal Father.

415
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,850
But what's the identity of that man called Baek Dae Gil?

416
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,660
How did you find out?

417
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,620
Everyone's speaking rampantly about him.

418
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,410
Is that so?

419
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,920
From what I've heard, he seems to be a gambler, but some say he's Kim Che Geon's disciple too.

420
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,980
And yesterday he arrested the traitor Lee In Jwa.

421
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:22,520
That's really nothing, so you needn't worry about it.

422
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,040
Yes, Royal Father.

423
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,640
I heard the news from overnight.

424
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:55,880
It's your lot. This, the Sangju gambling den and Busanpo gambling den.

425
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,680
And this is Gwangju, Jeolla Province.

426
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,600
This, Choongcheong Province.

427
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,560
I'll ask you for the funds as they become needed.  You manage the rest, Yeon Hwa.

428
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,060
All right.  We'll do that.

429
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,220
I'm sorry.

430
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:21,290
For mistaking you for the one that killed my father and for despising you.

431
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,450
It's all in the past.  Forget it.

432
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,050
Thank you.  I'll repay this favor over time.

433
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,570
What's your reason?

434
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,030
What do you mean?

435
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:48,290
Your reaching out to Lee In Jwa.

436
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:54,690
I was only speaking up out of fear that the truth would be disdained.

437
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,890
And not the case of you clutching Lee In Jwa's hand which he extended to you?

438
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,910
An affluence of greed will court calamity.

439
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:14,770
And how have you, who speak of such, not been able to shed your affluence of greed?

440
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,070
Shall we speak more frankly?

441
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:25,350
The crown prince has no heir, nor is his health good.

442
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:32,040
However, you wonder why I have chosen him over you?

443
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:39,080
I will not watch the plight of a water maid's child seated on the royal throne.

444
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,660
I cannot bear to see such lowborns soil the royal court.

445
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,640
Are you finished?

446
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,600
I have not spoken wrongly though.

447
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,880
Well, I shall...

448
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,700
In two days, was it?

449
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,930
Your Highness, I am fine like this,

450
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,430
but how is it that you're looking nearly dead?

451
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:38,890
Thankfully, before my life is up, I will be able to witness it.

452
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,020
The image of your head dropping.

453
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:56,120
Your Highness, I do not see your life longer than mine, actually.

454
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:04,330
Your Highness, do you have the time to spend that short life of yours in vain?

455
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,230
Why in vain?

456
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:12,770
To see you locked up in jail like this, I feel as though my ailment is healed.

457
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,130
I will walk out of here alive.

458
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:31,560
So you can watch from the afterlife, you wench.

459
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,460
Your two sons wielding their swords against each other's hearts.

460
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,840
I will surely make that happen.

461
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,980
Lee In Jwa,

462
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:47,730
you are really worse than a beast.

463
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:55,220
My sons are not animals.  They have human blood.

464
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:05,350
Mark my words.  With a smiling face, I will watch your head go flying.

465
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,100
Will see about that, Your Highness.

466
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,320
You.

467
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,580
What do you want?

468
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,210
Get me some paper and ink with a writing brush.

469
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,800
If I'm not careful, I can lose my life.

470
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,860
I'll give you 1,000 nyangs.

471
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:58,280
Since everything is chaotic, don't accept any customers for the time being, understood?

472
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,220
Yes, Ma'am.

473
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,700
Noonim!  (older sister) 

474
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,330
What is it?

475
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,980
I was told that if I delivered this letter that I would get 1,000 nyangs.

476
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,060
Why did you shield him?

477
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,950
When you are someone who's not been affiliated with Lee In Jwa.

478
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:36,560
We are all Soron, so would my inkling be different than yours?

479
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,920
I just held a different sword.

480
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,600
But why then...

481
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,860
Yi-Yi-Je-Yi.

482
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,100
Attack the barbarian with a barbarian?

483
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:53,230
Weren't you ministers wanting to cut off ties with Lee In Jwa as well?

484
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:59,930
That man is always overweening, so that thought had crossed my mind.

485
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:04,040
Hence, I have gathered you here today.

486
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:09,890
 If I can survive from here, I will give you my everything. 

487
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:14,100
 I will give you the sword in my grasp to you. 

488
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,020
 Is it a knife sharper than you?  

489
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,080
 Jeongchoong Year, the head of the revolt, Master Jeong. 

490
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,550
Lee In Jwa no longer has any hope.

491
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:28,820
Then?

492
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,090
A dull knife should be discarded for a new one.

493
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:52,660
These were prepared by Lord Lee In Jwa.

494
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:17,090
 I have some very regrettable news for you, My Lord. 

495
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,320
 The situation is that not only will the gold nuggets not work, not even the mother of all gold nuggets will do, 

496
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,020
 even if I push enough money for them to live well the rest of their lives on. 

497
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,020
 My, isn't this Yeon Hwa. 

498
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,420
 You've worked hard. 

499
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,940
 Have you been well? 

500
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:50,500
 Everyone's turning their heads, not wanting to get involved. 

501
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,910
 I wasn't going to say this either. 

502
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,720
 But since I need to live too, I'm going to have to take it back. 

503
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,590
 My gambling den. 

504
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,790
So Boss Hong Mae turned her back on you too?

505
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:35,040
How fascinating.  Now that I am in jail,

506
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:41,860
it's become quite easy to decipher which cards should be discarded and which should be kept.

507
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,200
Hey!  Where are you going?

508
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,710
Before Lee In Jwa dies, I have something to ask him.

509
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,790
Ask what now?

510
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,240
My father.  Why he killed him.

511
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,620
Yeon Hwa, why are you here?

512
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:15,610
From now on, we'll be seeing each other often in this house.

513
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,840
Don't cause trouble, come back as soon as you've seen his face.

514
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:26,630
But you guys are too much.  How is it that no one but me works in this house?

515
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,860
At least get some food for me or something.

516
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,760
In this house,  when you search,

517
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,780
find the food, and eat it first, you're  the owner of the food.

518
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:42,660
No one but you works, you said?  Why you little young rascal.

519
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,030
I'm entering the palace starting tomorrow.

520
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,140
Entering the palace?

521
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:50,150
Like you said, I need to work too, right?

522
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,460
Good. One more to work.

523
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,550
You're here.

524
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,540
How do you feel?

525
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:08,960
So you still haven't had any change of mind?

526
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,380
I'm the one who locked you up here.  Why are we asking about that again?

527
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:25,190
Consort Sook abandoned you and your younger brother was born a prince and lives in luxury.  Don't you feel wronged?

528
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,560
Look here, Lee In Jwa.

529
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:33,330
Even if you talk a hundred or a thousand times, I have no desire whatsoever to join your side.

530
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,730
So you came to bid me farewell?

531
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:42,100
If I could, I'd love to curse your head off.

532
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,840
But I've grown some sense too now.

533
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,050
Wouldn't I have a hidden card?

534
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,780
I don't know what you're trying to scheme now.

535
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,840
He's alive.

536
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:13,460
Your father, Baek Man Geum is alive.

537
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,320
Why?

538
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,770
Because your head's about to drop, you're getting desperate?

539
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,810
Go and confirm it.

540
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:32,750
With your two eyes, personally confirm Baek Man Geum's corpse.

541
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:41,230
You should hurry.  One more day and I'll be dead and gone too.

542
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:46,710
So you'll never find your father Baek Man Geum either.

543
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,400
Hey, kid!  What the heck are you doing?

544
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,630
He's gone crazy.

545
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,480
That rascal is doing this to his father's tomb.  This is bad.

546
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:31,780
 Don't lie.  You think I'd be tricked again? 

547
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,280
 Now you know it too, don't you? 

548
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,050
 I alone have been sincere with you. 

549
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:44,430
 The one who truly wished for you to overcome your fate and become a great tiger 

550
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,970
 is none other than me, Lee In Jwa. 

551
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:59,520
 Save me. Then I will have you meet your father Baek Man Geum. 

552
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,630
Hey, kid!  What is this you're doing!

553
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,510
Are you crazy?

554
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:31,950
Baek Dae Gil, only you can save me.

555
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,220
Save me.

556
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,100
Save this Lee In Jwa, I said.

557
