 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

3
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,230
So, are you awake now?

4
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,970
It took me a whole day to find you. How did you even get all the way here?

5
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,300
Who are you?

6
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,240
Who am I?

7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,760
We have a long history of fighting each other.

8
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,230
What's with his eyes?

9
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,280
Wait, did he really lose his memory?

10
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,540
If he really lost his memories, that changes everything.

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,860
Who is this brat?

12
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,400
 He's a demon that eats humans. 

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,390
 You'll soon be able to taste hell with this guy. 

14
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,070
Like I said, who is he?!

15
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,110
A slave. He was running away, so I caught him.

16
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,150
So what do you think? I'll give him to you for 10 nyangs.

17
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,210
Five nyangs.

18
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,080
Five nyangs?!

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,810
Ever since you started selling salt, you've become quite a cheap bastard.

20
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,390
Just take the five nyangs when I offer it to you.

21
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,950
You don't like it? Well, never mind.

22
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,490
Even if I go through hell,

23
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,150
I guess I won't be able to beat my demon orabeoni. Okay, give me the five nyangs.

24
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,860
But orabeoni, I have one condition.

25
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,590
 Until I come buy him back, don't let this bastard set one foot in Hanyang. 

26
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,070
 Just work his ass off in the salt field. 

27
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,290
 To the point where his eyes are glazed over. 

28
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,950
 You got that? 

29
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,530
Look here! How many fingers?

30
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,050
Aigoo, would you look at that?

31
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,180
I will take this as payment for treating you!

32
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,050
 Just fix him up to the point he is usable. 

33
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,670
I'm sure I'll have use for him somewhere.

34
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,430
Who are you?

35
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,040
Where am I?

36
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,810
Everyone calls you Ban Poon. ( Farthing, implying "retarded" ) Don't you even know your name?

37
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,480
My name?

38
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,550
You must have really lost your memory.

39
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,770
Anyhow, nice to meet you. I'm Seol Im. Gye Seol Im.

40
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,620
Where did that wench, Seol Im go off to?

41
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,060
I'll see you around!

42
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,330
You're quite handsome.

43
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,420
Look at him. That guy is the owner of this salt farm,

44
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,350
and his nickname is "Demon."

45
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,460
Since he can make a perfectly normal person into a cripple,

46
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,790
be very careful around him, okay?

47
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,270
Is Demon here?

48
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,440
Why are you coming now?

49
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,360
I'll be able to use you soon.

50
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,480
 All the people here were sold here for paltry sums. 

51
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,360
 And all they do is work their backs off. 

52
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,390
 But even if they work their backs off, they can't even pay such a small amount back, and end up dying. 

53
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,060
How much were you sold for?

54
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,020
I was only sold for 20 nyangs.

55
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,920
And even after working here for two years, I can't even pay half of that back.

56
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,300
Do you see that over there?

57
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,810
Each of them is worth 10 nyangs, so 30 nyangs. How about it?

58
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,240
If they have worked their backs off and have run out of energy, they get sold off again like that.

59
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,710
But even still, that's better.

60
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,040
Most just die here.

61
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,080
They die under the heat of the sun or from receiving lashes.

62
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,090
And if they don't die of that,

63
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,410
they die of hunger.

64
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,920
- Aigoo, Father! 
- Why are you stopping?!

65
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,560
 Aigoo, Father! 

66
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,050
It's no use even if you go there.

67
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,780
What Seol Im said is correct.

68
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,800
Follow me.

69
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,420
What is this, you bastard?

70
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,840
Who brought me to this place?

71
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,470
Huh!

72
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,220
Why?  What are you going to do if you find out?

73
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,050
Name. What is my name?!

74
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,760
Your name is Ban Poon, and you are mine now.

75
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,550
See? You have a debt of 45 nyangs to me.

76
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,360
 Baek Dae Gil? Is that my name? 

77
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,020
Until you pay all this off, you can't leave, you got that?

78
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,980
And what if I don't want to?

79
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,610
This bastard... Just because I was going easy on you, do I look like a joke to you?

80
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,120
Step on it.

81
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:17,430
Look how you stare.  Hey, if you want to pay me back a day sooner, get on up and go work.

82
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,650
Move quickly! Move quickly!

83
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,350
Over here.

84
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,750
QUICKLY!

85
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,980
If you want to eat, don't think about anything but working.

86
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,090
Move!

87
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,140
Hey, Ban Poon! What are you doing not working?!

88
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,460
Please have some.

89
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,190
Thank you.

90
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,810
Father, have some more.

91
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,590
You guys eat it.

92
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,080
Don't be like that, Grandpa. Please take some.

93
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,440
You guys eat it.

94
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,630
 Eat. 

95
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,250
It's no use.

96
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,980
You can't escape this place no matter how hard you try.

97
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,940
What?

98
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,690
You don't remember?

99
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,970
This... You gave it to me.

100
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,150
What?

101
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,780
Why would I do that?

102
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,740
Because we're friends.

103
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,740
Kill him.

104
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:31,500
You guys watch this carefully. The day you escape from this place, you will die.

105
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,220
What are you doing? Quick, slice that bastard's neck and throw him in the pig sty.

106
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,870
Yes, sir!

107
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,580
No! Please spare him! Please!

108
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,490
He is my son! Please spare him!

109
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,130
- Father! 
 -  Please spare him! 

110
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,040
My son! My son! Please spare him!

111
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,320
Let go of my hand.

112
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,400
Father!

113
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,240
My son!

114
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,280
What's with the stare?  What?  You want to croak too?

115
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,850
Starve that bastard Ban Poon from now on.

116
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,530
Yes, sir!

117
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,860
Your Highness.

118
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,280
You should be keeping busy both night and day, so what is your reason for being here?

119
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,640
Why have you called the Wolhyang Restaurant's owner...

120
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,910
October 13th, Gyeyu year (1693).

121
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,970
Whose date of birth is this?

122
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,440
This is something with which you should not concern yourself.

123
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:34,780
 If it was October of Gyeyu (1693), that would be the date of birth of my older brother, a six-month premature baby, who died before my birth. 

124
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,570
 Just why would Royal Mother have my dead older brother's date of birth? 

125
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,520
I wonder why our Highness is so moody today?

126
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,460
I am thinking right now. So let's just drink quietly today.

127
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,840
You're thinking? Your Highness is?

128
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,590
The biggest playboy on Earth has thoughts? The wandering stray dog would laugh at that.

129
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,820
My Lords! Please come over this way!

130
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,950
Fine! Then let's play to our heart's content!

131
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,470
Please tell me.

132
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,410
What is it? Is it something that you cannot even tell your mother?

133
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:55,500
Royal Mother. What is your reason for having my dead older brother's date of birth?

134
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,440
I was merely wondering, if that child is alive,

135
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:13,990
what kind of life he would be living right now. What other reason do you think I have?

136
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,750
What is it?

137
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,260
Are you still curious about something?

138
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,050
No.

139
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,120
Your Highness...

140
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,890
 King Sookjong 

141
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,770
Were you looking for me, Your Majesty?

142
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,980
Do you want to be the King?

143
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,670
That is outrageous, Your Majesty!

144
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,670
You who are smarter and wiser than anybody else,

145
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,750
why on earth are you living like a playboy?

146
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,070
It's probably because your mother made you do it.

147
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:21,020
She probably told you to stay far away from politics, and instead be close to drink and women.

148
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,230
That's how you evade the eyes of the noble subjects who are like jackals

149
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,390
and build your future plan to claim the throne.

150
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,290
Isn't that right?

151
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,700
That is not true, Your Majesty.

152
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,240
I just wanted to serve under you, Your Majesty, and—

153
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,090
Cut that crap...

154
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,780
and just answer my question.

155
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:56,710
If I give you the throne, do you have any intention of becoming King?

156
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,130
That is impossible, Your Majesty! When we have Hyungnim, the Crown Prince, how could I ever—

157
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,470
How can you hardly understand what I say?

158
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,870
Is there a law that states that the Crown Prince must become the King?

159
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,470
I am right now folding my two hands, two feet (pleading), and my pride

160
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,470
by asking if you have any intention of becoming King.

161
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,740
Approach me.

162
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,630
You can choose to be either a righteous king like King Sejong,

163
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,230
or a monster king like King Yeonsan.

164
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,890
That is completely up to you. So do you...

165
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,120
want to become one or not?

166
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,350
 There is no law that states the Crown Prince must become King. 

167
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,210
 I am right now folding my two hands, two feet, and my pride 

168
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,940
 by asking if you have any intention 

169
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,260
 of becoming King. 

170
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,630
Your Majesty, the Uniform Land Tax Act

171
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,390
is garnering much resistance from the rural aristocratic landlords.

172
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,800
Shouldn't we evaluate it further and rewrite the law?

173
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,690
What the Right State Councilor said is true.

174
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,800
The total enforcement of the Uniform Land Tax Act

175
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,340
has not matured as of yet.

176
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,890
Then...

177
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,610
Pathetic things.

178
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,750
Since

179
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,770
my eye disease is severe,

180
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,750
I'm having a hard time reading the reports.

181
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,680
Nowadays, my ears are going deaf too.

182
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,850
I don't hear your sage opinions well.

183
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,590
Crown Prince,

184
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,900
what do you think?

185
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,310
Sire. It appears Your Majesty's royal body has badly weakened due to overwork.

186
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,720
I will have the royal physician read your pulse.

187
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,960
I'll abdicate the throne.

188
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,380
You mustn't!  Please take back those words!

189
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,680
Your Majesty, that is an act that startles both the Heaven and the Earth!

190
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,630
Your Majesty is strong. How can you decree an abdication of the throne?

191
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,880
May Your Majesty take back the royal edict!

192
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,450
Take back the royal edict!

193
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,520
My eyes are becoming blind and my ears are becoming deaf, so I want to step down from the throne

194
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,170
and take some rest, but you all are saying no and no?

195
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,120
Then, we'll go halfway (compromise) and have the Crown Prince be the Regent.

196
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,030
It mustn't be!

197
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,630
Please take back your abdication of the throne!

198
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,520
It mustn't be, Your Majesty!

199
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,350
Please take back your edict!

200
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,250
If you gain something,

201
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,460
then you ought to give something! That is the order of things!

202
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,010
I'm done with going back and forth.

203
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,120
So you all can stop!

204
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,190
 Your son, 

205
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,560
 instead of wearing the crown, I shall wield the sword. 

206
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,450
 I will cut off the limbs of the corrupt officials who exploit the subjects, 

207
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,600
 I will purge the traitors to the throne, 

208
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,790
 and I will go in advance on Your Majesty's road 

209
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,300
 to open up the road first. 

210
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,950
 Does that seem as easy as the words sound? 

211
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,130
 That's harder than being King, you rascal. 

212
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,770
 You should yak when you know what you're saying. 

213
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,170
 I'm sorry, Father King. 

214
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,480
 Crazy punk. 

215
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,950
 Fine then. 

216
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,740
 I shall wait and see 

217
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,930
 just what type of sword you wield. 

218
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,200
Father King.

219
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,620
Please take back the regency order.

220
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,590
Father King!

221
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,720
Your son can never accept this decree!

222
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,700
Please take back your royal edict!

223
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,370
Please take it back!

224
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,660
- When did it start? 
- Royal Father.

225
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,900
Royal Father, what are you talking about...

226
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,270
When exactly did you start throwing up blood like that?

227
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm talking about your blood vomit.

228
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,110
Your body's not even well,

229
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,630
so stop that show and accept the regency role.

230
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,070
Prince Yeoning.

231
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,980
Why is your face full of gloom?

232
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,160
Is the Crown Prince's assumption of the regency

233
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,740
causing you to panic

234
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,850
that if the royal throne has become distanced from you

235
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,850
this might cause you to lose everything?

236
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,660
It isn't so.

237
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,630
If there is something which worries and causes me panic,

238
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,690
it is solely His Highness's, my royal brother's health.

239
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,960
His chronic illness, plus the fevers and chills,

240
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,300
as well as phlegm inflammation.

241
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,580
How will he be able to handle the regency

242
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,950
under the watchful eyes of the Royal Father?

243
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,080
It's a case of the mouse worrying for the cat.

244
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,650
Isn't it so?

245
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,070
 Whether it is His Majesty's fiery temperament, 

246
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,860
 whether it is the sanctions of the royal subjects, 

247
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,770
  or whether it his congenital chronic illness, 

248
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,850
 all of these are things the Crown Prince must overcome. 

249
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,860
 These are not what you need to worry about, Prince. 

250
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,180
Your Highness, Royal Brother.

251
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,270
It's been a long time since we faced each other like this.

252
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,660
Your Highness, enforce the regency.

253
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:58,640
I will be the eyes and ears to Your Highness.

254
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,730
I will be the arms and legs to Your Highness.

255
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,910
Both Father King, and you,

256
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,630
put such heavy burdens on me.

257
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,330
Hurry and move! Or you'll get no dinner tonight!

258
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,670
Sun's about to set! Hurry it up!

259
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,570
 Two at the crossing, one to the left, and one on the right. 

260
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,590
 A tiger. 

261
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,650
 Kim Che Geon 

262
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,860
- Keep a tight watch. 
- Yes, sir.

263
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,450
Quiet down. It's not like I'm going to eat you whole.

264
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,420
You little...!

265
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,020
What? Am I doing something wrong? You're mine!

266
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,360
- Stay still! 
- No!

267
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,180
Let's go.

268
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,070
What's happening?

269
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,840
What, what's happening?

270
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,970
What are you doing?! Go catch them!

271
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,010
Yes, sir! Hurry!

272
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,120
Quick, run!

273
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,280
Wait.

274
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,900
If we go up there, we'll be tiger food.

275
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,170
W-Where are we going? I heard a tiger lives on this mountain.

276
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,610
That's why we need to pass this mountain.

277
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,400
H-How about we go b-back?

278
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,170
If we go back now, they might forgive us.

279
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,310
Forgive? What will you do after you salvage your life then?

280
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:36,730
Just work on the salt farm until you're dried  to death?

281
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,470
Go by yourself.

282
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,880
Without me, you can run away.

283
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,240
At least that man, Demon, won't kill me.

284
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,430
Live, then we both live.  Die, then we both die.

285
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,330
Let's go together.

286
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,380
You need to go back to your hometown!

287
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,940
Hurry!

288
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,850
Only look forward and go. I'll take care of you.

289
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,590
When I count to three, run down the mountain. Never look back.

290
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,290
Whatever happens, run.

291
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,390
What about you?  What about you then?

292
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,510
I'll figure something out.

293
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,530
One...

294
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,160
Two...

295
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,880
THREE!!!

296
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,470
Which way is it?

297
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,200
Let's go.

298
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,430
Yes, sir!

299
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,460
 Ban Poon... 

300
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,370
Just now, how did you do that?

301
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,520
With just a sword, how can you catch a tiger?

302
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,600
What about you then? Were you thinking you'd catch the tiger with that rod?

303
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,550
I don't know if you're lucky or you're gutsy.

304
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:43,310
If you had cowered before the tiger's force or run away,

305
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,090
you would have been the tiger's meal.

306
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:57,480
Besides him, there's another tiger on this mountain.

307
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,170
If you don't want to die, go back.

308
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,590
Ban Poon!

309
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,050
I thought you died!

310
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,040
Are you alright?

311
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,930
What happened?

312
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,930
If the lashing doesn't do it, we'll have to make him taste poop.

313
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,890
How's the taste of poop?

314
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,520
If you're keen on living, just say the words, "I did wrong."

315
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:13,740
"Please save me. I really did wrong."  Go on, say it.

316
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,820
Why, you bastard!

317
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,680
You bastard. You stubborn bastard.

318
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,860
Put that bronze coin hanging by his neck in his mouth.

319
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,870
It reeks!

320
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,770
It's your road money for your trip to hell.

321
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,830
 For Joseon's best gambler, one nyang should suffice. 

322
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,380
You again, punk?

323
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,430
W-W-Water...

324
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,910
What are you?

325
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,220
Should we make a bet

326
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,960
whether I live or die?

327
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,210
Survive.

328
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,750
 Beg for your life right now.  

329
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,830
 Then you can live. 

330
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,540
 I'm going to survive and return. 

331
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,530
 Definitely. 

332
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,490
 Father, don't worry.  

333
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,430
 I'm not going die. 

334
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,860
 That bastard who killed you. 

335
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,880
 Until I cut his throat, I will never die. 

336
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,550
 I can't die, I said! 

337
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,020
Is Ban Poon here?

338
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,730
Look at me.

339
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,470
So your gaze is still fierce and alive.

340
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,900
Only your mouth is alive.

341
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,590
Is that why you're nicknamed "Demon"?

342
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,770
Oh yeah?

343
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,620
Let's see if you can still say that when your arms and legs are broken.

344
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,690
That bastard, break his arms and legs.

345
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,600
And put a fire rub in that fierce gaze of his.

346
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,810
What is it that you want?

347
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,590
Is it money?

348
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,600
Then I'll earn enough to make you more than a millionaire.

349
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,960
What is that bastard yakking about.

350
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,130
That.

351
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,540
 Double tens 

352
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,630
A d-double ten?

353
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,740
 Eight and Two 

354
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,800
How did you do that?

355
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,850
 What is this? 

356
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,990
 How... how did you do that? 

357
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,410
 I did it well.  How else? 

358
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,960
 Watch.  

359
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,090
 Ta-da! 

360
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,770
 Oh my.  What is this? 

361
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,430
 What? 

362
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,550
 Draw.  Do a draw. 

363
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:36,490
 Until I come and buy him back, don't let this bastard set one foot in Hanyang.  

364
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,970
 So this Ban Poon bastard is a master gambler? 

365
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,180
How about it?

366
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,660
How about we go to Hanyang and scoop a big one?

367
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,140
Go wash up.

368
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,170
I'm coming in.

369
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,350
What kind of girl doesn't know shame.

370
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,620
Thanks. I  really thank you.

371
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:56,650
In your absence, I don't know what would've happened to me.

372
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,870
Maybe I would have bitten my tongue to die for real.

373
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:06,250
How did you get here?

374
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,260
That day, my father,

375
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,130
he even bought me a ring, you see.

376
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,440
But instead of betting money, he put up my wrist.

377
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,840
Then he goes and dies himself.

378
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,830
But do you know what's more bitter?

379
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,040
Even so,

380
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,020
I miss him.

381
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,420
My father.

382
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,680
Father.

383
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,740
It's all because of that ghost Yook.

384
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,960
I grind my teeth and endure this

385
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,810
for my father, for my mother's grudge.

386
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,280
Until I shatter that ghost Yook's neck

387
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,250
I can't die.

388
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,010
And you?

389
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,440
Did you get your memory back?

390
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,940
Not yet.

391
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,300
Not all of it.

392
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,750
Well, you'll regain it soon.

393
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,840
You...

394
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,350
Don't forget me.

395
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,320
Do you understand?

396
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,740
You know what happens to you if you get any other ideas, right?

397
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,010
Don't worry.  I'm just a stray dog.

398
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,950
I'm just a stray that bites and brings you brass coins.

399
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,940
We'll see then.

400
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,700
If you're a stray that bites brass coins from the betting table for me,

401
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,020
or a crazy dog that bites his owner.

402
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:30,150
Sister!  Sister Hong Mae!

403
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,590
What?

404
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,760
That...

405
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,420
Move! Move you bastards!

406
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,580
There.

407
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,510
Aigo, Sister Hong.  Have you been well?

408
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,140
See how uppity that face looks.

409
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,070
Royal Concubine Yang's going to cry about it.

410
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,450
You jerk!  Did my words go out your ear?

411
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,350
- I clearly—
- Clearly,

412
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,550
you said you'd buy him back, right?

413
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,750
So just say what you want, before you croak.

414
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,890
As promised, you buy him back.

415
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:28,600
Buy him back?  How much?

416
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,610
- Five nyangs?
- Five hundred.

417
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,710
Five hundred?

418
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,790
Orabeoni, you're not joking with me right now, aren't you?

419
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,270
Nope.  Sister Hong,

420
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,900
I don't want to draw blood here either.

421
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:52,110
How about a round, with him as the wager?

422
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,630
What trick are you playing?

423
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,110
If he loses, fine.

424
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,500
I'll disappear for good.

425
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,760
If you lose, Sister Hong, at 500 nyang,

426
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,460
you take him back. How about it? Nice and tight, right?

427
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,930
 He's a punk who can't remember anyway. 

428
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,670
Just don't say otherwise after it's done.

429
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:23,060
I'll put your head on a stake in your salt field first.

430
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,510
What's with the fierce talk?

431
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,250
Now then.

432
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,740
Let's have a round.

433
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,330
Got any more players?

434
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,260
 Double fives 

435
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:33,190
So the best gambling den in Hanyang doesn't have much to it.

436
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,320
Well, then.  I should be the one to cut your throat anyway.

437
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,500
I was thinking you looked familiar.  Do you by chance know me?

438
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,920
Gamblers all look alike anyway.

439
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,680
Done with talking, shuffle and spread the tags.

440
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,690
Boys, grab your weapons tight.

441
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,220
Yes, Sir!

442
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:01,500
Who knows what our Sister Hong might do once she's pissed.

443
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,140
What is this ruckus?

444
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,840
Oh my, big trouble. Big trouble.

445
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,180
 Lee In Jwa  

446
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,730
You're here, My Lord.  And Miss is here too.

447
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:01,690
Baek Dae Gil?

448
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,050
My Lord, let me explain—

449
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,290
I'll settle on hearing your excuses later.

450
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,400
It is indeed quite startling to see you with your face looking so normal.

451
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,900
Just that, as soon as you managed to save your life, you sit in the gambling den?

452
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,730
Do you know me?

453
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,740
Did you lose your memory?

454
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,320
Hey, you noble lord, I'm asking you!

455
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,380
Do you know me?

456
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,080
Of course I do. Baek Dae Gil.

457
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:48,890
What are you?  Tell me what you know.  Everything!

458
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:55,110
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

459
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,210
What?

460
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,930
It was what you yourself chose,

461
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:04,250
hence finding your memory is also your fate, isn't it?

462
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,620
Fine, play a round against me.

463
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:13,880
Since I must hear it.  Everything you know.

464
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,780
For your noble standing, isn't this better than some crazy knife-work?

465
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,120
What? The stake's too low?

466
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,230
If I lose, I'll wipe your bottom too.

467
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,740
So quit worrying and play a round with me.

468
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,840
So you're sincere. Huh?

469
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,830
We'll do a one-round match.

470
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:56,030
If it's your wish, choose two tags first.

471
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:10,080
If you are sincere, everything can be achieved.

472
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,150
So your fate hangs on that tag.

473
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:39,210
Fate? Don't think that's something that should come out of  an animal's snout.

474
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,590
 Nine  

475
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,630
White-Faced Scholar.

476
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:50,730
No, was it Lee In Jwa?

477
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:00,900
So was your memory not lost, or did you just regain it?

478
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,900
Why did you kill him?  Why did you kill my father!

479
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,470
 Double nines 

480
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,660
It's a double nine!

481
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,380
Double nines...

482
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:24,490
You must have endured bone-shattering pain all for this one play.

483
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,350
Such a regret indeed.

484
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,760
 Double tens 

485
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,520
It's a double ten!

486
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,070
What...

487
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,820
What crazy...

488
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,890
Is this everything?

489
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:50,540
If you've got more tags you've prepared to get me, bring them out.

490
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,310
It's a swindle.

491
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,920
A swindle?

492
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,400
A swindle?

493
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,800
What happens when you strike a swindle in the gambling den?

494
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,610
If you get caught striking a swindle, then you'll lose your hand.  No?

495
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,410
One swindle and it's the hand.

496
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:10,800
But twice, and it's the head that goes flying.

497
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:22,090
A swindle, you say?  Do you have proof?

498
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,040
What if I do?

499
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,340
You should be well aware that I didn't play a swindle.

500
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:34,920
If you're confident, place the wager.  You can live fine without a hand!

501
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,980
What? Scared?

502
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:41,680
Then lay down the stake money, your self-respect and get on up!

503
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:49,610
Alright.  If that is what you so desire, I shall wager my wrist.

504
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:53,470
However, if you are wrong, you shall never hear it.

505
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:58,130
The reason why your father, Baek Man Geum died.

506
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:02,750
Hey, Demon! Come and dig in his cuff.

507
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,440
Pardon me a bit. Let's have a look.

508
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,340
What?

509
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,000
What's this?

510
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,040
An eight! An eight!

511
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:27,160
So you hid the ten and switched it for your eight.

512
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,900
 Was it when he grabbed me by the collar?  

513
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,700
The proof is out and the wager was bet.

514
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,460
What are you waiting for, Boss? Hurry and cut off his hand.

515
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,120
Didn't you hear me!

516
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,210
What to do now.

517
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,790
What's so difficult about cutting a mere hand off?

518
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:08,610
Noble Lord, I'm Demon, a Demon.  Remember that well.

519
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,470
Baek Dae Gil.

520
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,930
What are you doing? Cut it off!

521
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:25,310

 A prince of a nation, yet there is not one thing I can do on my accord?  

527
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,620
 You, are you crying?  

528
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,170
 - Dae Gil!  
- Aigo, you're going to break my face.  Stop the touching. 

529
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,270
 Daebak. That rascal is going on the path set for him. 

530
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,500
 Hey, over there!  You're Lee In Jwa? 

531
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,720
 From now on, there will be a lot for you to do.  

532
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,170
 I'm also aware of Lady Sook Bin's past. 

533
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,140
 - You wench!
- Help me have an audience with His Majesty.  

534
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,720
 The king you serve is one who deserves death. 

535
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,600
 Hence we shall come collect his head. 

536
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,470
 Why do you cast such a heavy mission upon your son?  

537
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:21,450
 I'm telling you to pull the sword to your content!
