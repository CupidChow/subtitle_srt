1
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,290
I will pick the last tag!

2
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,010
But! If I pick the 10-point tag,

3
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,260
you will never mess with my baby ever again.

4
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,450
Understand?

5
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,110
Honey.

6
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,360
This is not a place for a lofty palace madam to meddle, so you can go back now.

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,330
From this point on, this Baek Man Geum

8
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,000
will take care of everything.

9
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,790
 Gae Ttong! Don't worry! This father 

10
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,410
 this father will definitely save you.  Why don't we start with the promise?

11
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,830
The promise that if I win this bet

12
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,990
you will no longer mess with my baby.

13
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,010
I will make that promise.

14
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,750
But if I follow your suggestion, I will be losing more than you.

15
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,260
That's why I'm thinking of adding one more condition.

16
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,730
The woman who used to be your wife, and the King's child.

17
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,360
Isn't that quite a scene?

18
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,270
You're worse than an animal.

19
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,600
You vermin!

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,230
Those are just  your  thoughts.

21
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,060
This is an arrow that the barbarians (Manchu) used during the second Manchu invasion of Korea.

22
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,670
It is known as a "six-nyang (tael) arrow."  (the weight  being six nyangs (240 g), a lot heavier than a traditional arrow) 

23
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,550
This arrow can easily pierce a 100-year-old pine tree.

24
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,400
So I have no doubt it will pierce a woman's body.

25
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,090
One of those wooden tags is a 10-point tag.

26
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,140
Choose wisely.

27
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:33,130
Keep in mind that the lives of that woman and  the baby depend on your one choice.

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:39,980
As I have told you before, you have only one chance.

29
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,000
 The probability is one in three. 

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,340
 Is it this one? 

31
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,680
 Or is it this one? 

32
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,020
 I can't think! I can't think clearly! 

33
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,740
It is probably best for you to hurry.

34
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,090
Kkwang Po! (lies and tricks)

35
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,980
 One of those wooden tags is a 10-point tag. 

36
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,370
 Choose wisely. 

37
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,070
 He never stated that it's just in these five tags. 

38
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,610
 This one must be the 10-point tag. 

39
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,340
 This definitely has to be the 10-point tag! 

40
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,070
 10
  Yes!

41
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,920
It is the 10-point tag!

42
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,670
The 10-point tag!

43
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,180
I won! I did it!

44
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,750
I saved them!

45
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,580
Hurry up! Hurry up and bring my baby back to me!

46
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,870
No. That tag is a Mangtong. ("10" - the last digit "0" means the lowest point and the gamer dies in the game.)

47
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,240
Too bad.

48
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,080
 No! 

49
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,090
I am quite surprised. What extreme luck.

50
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,030
You bastard!

51
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,380
I will one day take that child myself.

52
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,310
That is that child's unavoidable fate for carrying the King's blood.

53
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,090
Bear that in mind.

54
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,990
Once that child is fully grown,

55
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,390
then I will take your life away.

56
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,500
Are you not afraid of the heavens?!

57
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,310
Saying that you are human.

58
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,690
Then how can you do such a thing like this?

59
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,950
Aren't you just satisfied that a child you thought was dead is now alive?

60
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,430
Bear this in mind.

61
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,450
After today, I will never follow you.

62
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,160
I will also never forgive you for what you did today.

63
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,080
If you don't forgive me, what are you capable of doing?

64
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,490
You're just a mere concubine without a prince.

65
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,430
You're just a lowly maid who doesn't even have a clan or a genealogy.

66
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,690
Tell me. Tell me just what you are capable of.

67
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,640
I have already thrown you away.

68
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,960
My relationship with you ends today.

69
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,530
An Tae Eum  (medicine given for upset stomach and loss of appetite in fifth and sixth months of pregnancy) 

70
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,710
This is my last consideration for you.

71
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,610
There is no one more stupid than you.

72
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,730
You abandoned your husband

73
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:42,000
and hold the silver spoon, so you should live well to show off.

74
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,650
What kind of ugly things did you want to see that you came all the way over here? That's the child you abandoned.

75
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,420
I thought you didn't care about him at all.

76
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,470
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,540
I thought he would really die.

78
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,090
Just a lowly court maid's child, born prematurely at six months.

79
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,790
It's hIs fate that he can't live in the palace.

80
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,760
That's why I sent him to you.

81
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,130
And that didn't go very well either.

82
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,620
I really thought he would die.

83
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,450
I'm sorry. Really.

84
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,430
I gave him a name.

85
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,490
It's not a very good name.

86
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,480
I named him Gae Ttong. (Dog poop)

87
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,110
Why Gae Ttong?

88
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,750
Baby.

89
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,150
Thank you so much for staying alive.

90
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,490
Thank you.

91
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,190
When you threw away Gae Ttong

92
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,840
you acted like you never wanted to see him ever again.

93
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,690
What caused you to change your mind?

94
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,410
What crime did a newborn commit?

95
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,710
It's all because of my karma.

96
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,410
It seems you've matured a bit now.

97
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,950
I understand the situation,

98
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,010
but how could you forgive your wife who ran away from you?

99
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,680
Were you able to forgive her?

100
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,810
 How long are you going to live like this?! 

101
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,860
 Have you ever 

102
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,530
 even once 

103
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,860
 thought that I was 

104
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,020
 a precious person to you? 

105
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,540
Actually I still hate her... I still hate your mom...

106
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,150
My Lady...

107
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,460
What were you doing outside the palace at this late hour?

108
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,110
Were you perhaps meeting with another man?

109
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,840
Your Majesty! Please forgive me! I was just—

110
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,480
Sook Won.

111
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,150
Since you've been a water maid for 10 years, I expected you to know the court rules at least.

112
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,990
Your Highness.

113
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,070
Is there anyone there?

114
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,420
Yes, Your Highness.

115
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,480
Lock this woman up in a jar immediately.

116
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,760
Your Highness.  Please forgive me, Your Highness.

117
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,280
Your Highness! Please forgive me, Your Highness!

118
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,590
Your Highness. Please forgive me.

119
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,910
Your tough fate will end today.

120
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,580
What are you doing? Get her.

121
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,710
Your Highness! Your Highness!

122
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,080
Your Highness!

123
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,350
Your Highness!

124
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,310
Right now, Lady Sook Won is locked up in a jar.

125
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,450
My Lady!

126
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,480
Are you okay, My Lady?

127
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,960
My Lady!

128
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,290
Queen. How did Sook Won get into this state?

129
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,570
Sook Won left the palace for a private matter last night and returned at  jashi  (11PM—1AM).

130
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:16,630
Private matter? She could have died.

131
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,130
Is what the Queen said true?

132
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,310
It is the truth, Your Majesty.

133
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,260
If you know anything more, tell him.

134
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,320
It was because the Lady Sook Won was frantically searching for a doctor.

135
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,840
And what was her reason to search for a doctor so late at night?

136
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,070
Your Majesty. It seems Lady Sook Won has become pregnant.

137
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,230
Pregnant, you say?

138
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,380
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

139
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,790
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

140
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,880
Queen.

141
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,820
I understand your feeling of wanting to enforce the court rules,

142
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,570
but I think you have treated her too harshly this time.

143
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,570
An Tae Eum  (medicine for upset stomach and loss of appetite in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy) 

144
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,430
 This is my last consideration to you. 

145
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,220
 My Lord, you are actually quite a frightening man. 

146
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,950
 But I have no intention 

147
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,190
 of giving this child to you. 

148
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,850
 This child will definitely, 

149
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,190
 definitely rise to the throne and pay back  

150
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,920
 the humiliation you gave me. 

151
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,150
How did you find out about Sook Won's pregnancy?

152
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,530
It was just a guess. We were quite lucky.

153
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,880
But My Lord, I will be meeting Her Highness the Queen tonight.

154
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,320
What should I do?

155
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,350
Do what you feel like doing.

156
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,380
There is never a moment of hesitation in you, never.

157
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,970
Is there anything that frightens you, My Lord?

158
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,300
Are you really not scared of anything?

159
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,440
I do have fears.

160
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,180
There is someone that this Lee In Jwa is scared of.

161
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
Isn't it strange?

162
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,240
Because even I am scared of that person.

163
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,290
 This person has risen alone to the peak of this world 

164
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,790
 and governs what is below him. 

165
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,500
 A warrior that even a million soldiers fear, someone who can even slice a mountain down. 

166
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,180
 A monster that has 100 eyes and 1000 ears.  
(meaning all knowing)

167
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,080
 It is the present King. 

168
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,210
Your Majesty. Lady Sook Won has arrived.

169
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,870
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

170
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,200
Just stop.

171
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,260
What do you mean?

172
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,730
I'm telling you to stop.

173
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,060
Your relationship with the other man behind my back.

174
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,950
Your Majesty. What do you mean?

175
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,610
  The man who made the gambler Baek Man Geum lose everything.  

176
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,810
 Become the King's woman. 

177
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,790
  Who brought  you, Bok Soon, to me with an elaborate plan. 

178
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,550
 And also, who moves others with his firm conviction. 

179
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,080
Could you possibly have thought I would not know about him?

180
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,100
- Your Majesty...
- Do you know...

181
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,450
why I am still keeping him alive?

182
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,330
It's for you.

183
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,570
I thought that someone like you, who has a lowly status and has no one to rely upon,

184
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,900
would not be able to survive in this place without him.

185
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,530
Your grace has no  limit, Your Majesty.

186
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,170
Do you know that

187
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,630
the Queen is also such a person to me.

188
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:49,360
Just as like I care for you, the Queen is also an important person to me.

189
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,900
Your grace has no  limit, Your Majesty.

190
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,170
I'm sorry towards you.

191
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,430
So, the child that you have hidden outside of the palace

192
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,610
I will not mention it anymore.

193
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,810
The decision you made must have been hard for a mother.

194
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,610
That's the moral that came naturally.

195
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,430
Your grace has no  limit, Your Majesty.

196
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,320
So are you feeling better now?

197
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,950
Yes, Your Highness.

198
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,090
Come sit down.

199
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,240
I have prepared medications that will help you with your pregnancy.

200
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,030
Thank you.

201
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:12,820
- But who is— 
 - Oh pardon me, I must have forgotten. Say your greetings. This person is Seol Joong, the owner of Wol Hyang Restaurant.

202
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,750
Since you are already here, why don't you join us? We're going to be playing Seung Gyung Do.

203
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,350
 Seung Gyung Do: A traditional Korean game involving wooden sticks (yuts) to move ranks in the game 

204
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:31,360
I have heard that  Admiral Choongmoo (Lee Soon Shin) never forgot to play this game even during battles with Japan.

205
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,560
It means that there is no better way to establish the hierarchy in the military than this game.

206
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,220
Your turn.

207
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,530
Yes, Your Highness.

208
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,350
Sook Won, don't be too startled. Just think of the baby in your womb.

209
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,400
Your Highness.

210
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,500
You can go now.

211
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,960
Your Highness, please  throw your yuts  (wooden sticks)  and forecast the future.

212
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:19,350
She can tell the future and read your face.

213
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,900
She says it's a prince. No,

214
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,360
she said she saw someone wearing a king's robe.

215
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,480
We're talking about the baby in your belly.

216
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,860
Your Highness, how can you believe a mere fortune-teller?

217
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,970
Don't say you wanted a princess. Is that it?

218
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,230
If you beat me, you will be treated as my friend.

219
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,130
But if I win...

220
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,710
I will end your life without fail.

221
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,450
 Hah! 
(Yut: All four sticks are lying flat side up—four steps forward.) 

222
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,500
Aren't you curious as to how I will end your life?

223
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,970
Your Highness, I heard Seung Gyung Do is based on luck.

224
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,100
How can we decide using a simple game like this?

225
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,100
When will we get another great chance like this?

226
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,170
A simple toss can make enemies into friends.

227
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,170
Why aren't you tossing them?

228
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,880
If you get  mo  (all four sticks round side up- five steps forward) or  yut  (all four flat side up-four steps forward), that means you beat me.

229
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,960
Dweet do! (one flat side stick with a dot facing up—one step back). You got dweet do!

230
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,190
This must be your fate.

231
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,310
-Your Highness...
- Bad rumors.

232
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,040
Are you aware of the bad rumors regarding your background?

233
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,070
I'm talking about the bad rumors related to your dead son, Prince Yeong Soo.

234
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,040
There is a rumor that you have another husband,

235
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,560
that the child's father is not the King, that the child is still alive, etc.

236
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,740
There are stories such as those floating around.

237
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,230
Your Majesty.

238
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,510
Why are you concerning yourself over these rumors?

239
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,820
Was that man's name

240
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,620
Baek Man Geum?

241
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,680
Arrest this man immediately.

242
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,320
Seeing how the child looks exactly like you and Sook Won,

243
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,090
I already know the answer without hearing it.

244
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,950
Does everyone remember the six-month premature baby,  the late Prince Yeong Soo, that Sook Won gave birth to?

245
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,130
If that child still lives,

246
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,090
If it is the child I hold now,

247
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,660
and if that child's biological father is not the King

248
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,490
but this man...

249
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,250
All right.

250
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,700
Since the involved parties are now present, confess now.

251
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,740
Are you Sook Won's husband?

252
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,050
Are you the dead prince's father?

253
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,790
- It will be best for you to tell the truth right away.
 Jang Hee Jae (Jang Ok Jeong, Queen's brother) 

254
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,930
Tell us that you are Sook Won's husband.

255
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,930
Hurry and confess that Yeong Soo's your son!

256
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,350
That is not so.

257
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,480
I don't know who that lady is,

258
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,850
or who Yeong Soo is.

259
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,820
I have absolutely no clue

260
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,680
what you guys are talking about.

261
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,600
You bastard.

262
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:10,040
I don't know anything. I said I don't know anything.

263
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,400
How can an insignificant person like me, a mere street gambler,

264
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,040
know someone as precious as her?

265
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,470
I didn't think this was going to be that easy.

266
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,090
Then you tell us.

267
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,770
Do you know this man?

268
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:35,470
 What should I do? What can I do? 

269
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,250
Why do you not have an answer?

270
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:46,360
Alright. You are bent on confessing before this child's dead body, you wretch!

271
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,840
Stop the accusation.

272
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,500
Your Majesty.

273
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,350
What on earth...

274
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,730
is going on, My Queen?

275
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:32,580
Your Majesty, there are rumors stating this child is the presumed dead Yeong Soo,

276
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,190
and during Sook Won's water-maid time, this man was—

277
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,400
I clearly warned you before.

278
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:46,340
Just who is spreading these false rumors around?

279
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,200
Is it you, Head Military Affairs Officer?

280
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,770
No, Your Majesty.

281
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,790
Then

282
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,870
is it you, Right Prime Minister?

283
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,780
That would be an absolutely unreasonable remark, Your Majesty.

284
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,370
Bad rumors in the streets, you say?

285
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,300
My Queen.

286
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,270
If you can't give me a reasonable explanation,

287
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,340
you will pay dearly for it.

288
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,830
Will you still continue?

289
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,420
We have proof.

290
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,890
We have evidence that this child is Sook Won's.

291
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,520
Evidence?

292
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,660
Come in.

293
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,310
They are the court ladies of San Shil Cheong. 
 (where royal babies are born) 

294
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,370
They were the ones who took care of Yeong Soo before he died.

295
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,220
Therefore, they would know Yeong Soo's face the best.

296
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,610
The dead prince Yeong Soo's face.

297
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:03,520
Why are you hesitating? Tell us the answer quickly.

298
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,400
That...

299
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,610
it seems this is not the prince.

300
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,800
How could that be? Did you look carefully?

301
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
I'm certain it's not him.

302
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,510
This child looks different, and the prince had a small mole on his chest.

303
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,340
We could not find any marks on this child's chest.

304
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,480
Your Majesty, you would know better than anyone else.

305
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,600
So please look and see if this is the prince.

306
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,860
This child

307
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,540
is not Yeong Soo.

308
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,080
That can't be. One more time—

309
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,100
Definitely,

310
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,920
that child

311
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,140
is not Yeong Soo, Queen.

312
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,240
 No. It can't be. 

313
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,760
It can't be.

314
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,480
No way...

315
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,780
Did you fool me again, you wretch?!

316
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,780
How did you dare me, you wretch—

317
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,840
Your Majesty!

318
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,260
What the heck are all you guys are doing?!  Huh?

319
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,360
Follow me.

320
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,120
Your Majesty! How could you do this?

321
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,000
Your Majesty!

322
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,340
Your Majesty!

323
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,380
Now, stop it.

324
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,040
You just need to stop.

325
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,260
Your Majesty!

326
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,660
Stop it now!

327
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,720
 Why didn't you say anything in advance? 

328
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,820
 I thought the child was going to die. 

329
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,800
You and I, too.  I thought all of us were going to die.

330
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,840
You, old man! GO FIND OUR CHILD NOW!

331
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,860
Sorry, I got the babies mixed up. If you wait a little longer—

332
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,320
You drunken dotard!

333
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,280
Where is my child, bastard?!

334
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,860
You wretch!  You are such a bitch!

335
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,660
Right! Kill me! Kill me, you bastard!

336
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,620
Ma'am, your child...

337
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,500
We're very sorry, Ma'am.

338
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,800
You can't even tell which one is your child?!  I felt bad for the child

339
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,900
and even gave him breast milk! WHY WOULD YOU TAKE MY CHILD?! WHY?!

340
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,840
I can't believe it!

341
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,380
My sweet child!

342
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Live well.  We won't be seeing each other again.

343
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,800
I was about to run away because I thought you would be beaten to death.

344
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,840
You okay?

345
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,440
 Your Majesty, she didn't respect our country's law and didn't honor the throne. 

346
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,000
 Punish her! 

347
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,180
 Punish her! 

348
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,400
Your Majesty, they've been outside for four  shijins (1 shijin = 2 hours).  

349
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:36,480
Your Majesty! Not punishing Jang family's crimes is not right!

350
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,060
Heed our request, please!

351
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,100
Heed our request, please!

352
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,260
Criminal Jang Hee Jae, you are under arrest!

353
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,000
  In 1694,  the year of gabsul (dog), Prince Yeoning, the future King Yeongjo was born. 

354
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,020
 1694, Gapsul Hwanguk 
(Change of ruling party in Gapsul year) 

355
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,820
 By King Sookjong's changing the bureau, a lot of the southern party who had held power were forced out. 

356
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:19,580
 The domineering Queen Jang Ok Jeong was dethroned and exiled as well. 

357
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,100
 Let go! Let go! 

358
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,700
I am the mother of this country. Your Majesty!

359
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,020
 Your Majesty! 

360
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,360
Royal Mother!

361
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,740
Don't be afraid, Crown Prince.

362
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,320
You do not need to worry about me.

363
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Crown Prince,  listen carefully to what I am saying.

364
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,680
Destroy them. If someone troubles you,

365
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,840
if someone tries to bring you down or criticizes you,

366
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,000
do not forgive them, do you understand?

367
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,620
You must not make mistakes like I did.

368
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,000
Heed my words.

369
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,400
Mother...

370
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,460
That way, you will take the throne and rule this country!

371
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,760
You will be Joseon's king. Do you understand me, Crown Prince?

372
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,400
Yes.

373
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:00,460
I will heed your words over and over again.

374
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,300
Of course.

375
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,040
That's right. You are still my son.

376
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:27,440
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

377
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,200
Your Majesty.

378
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,920
 Lee In Jwa 

379
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,400
Who... are you?

380
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,500
I'm here to read your future tonight.

381
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,580
There are black and white baduk stones in this bag.

382
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,920
If you pick a black stone, you'll be repressed by the western party's force and won't avoid death.

383
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,360
But, if you pick a white one, you will keep your life.

384
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,400
You will also gain the throne in the future.

385
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,600
How about it?

386
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,080
Let's see what future awaits you tonight.

387
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,180
I will definitely

388
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,970
protect you.

389
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,860
You will?

390
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,100
Yes, Crown Prince. However,

391
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,350
if I protect you,

392
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,950
what will you give me in return?

393
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,400
I will give you everything.  If you will protect me,

394
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,880
I will give you everything I have.

395
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,280
That is... That is...

396
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,300
I will even give you the throne.

397
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,330
You should sit on the throne, Crown Prince, not me.

398
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,780
As for me, I will just accept your heart.

399
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,450
You have to pull both of the bull's horns at the same time!
 Choi Lee Seok 

400
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,650
How hard would it be to get the  Crown Prince out of the way? 
 Jo Il Soo 

401
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,760
- What is all this? 
 -    Open them. 

402
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,200
It is the price of the life of the Crown Prince.

403
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,170
And who are you?

404
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:25,060
It is known that the sharpest blade is the most dangerous.

405
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,850
If you can accept my kind gift,

406
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,010
and can guarantee the safety of the Crown Prince,

407
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,620
I will give that blade

408
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,890
for you Lords to use.

409
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,790
My Lord, I am quite surprised at your keenly penetrating eyes.

410
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,770
Did you plan this far ahead?

411
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,830
Your plan of using Lady Sook won

412
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,130
was in order to have the Queen dethroned and take Crown Prince in your hands?

413
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,420
Was it all planned from the very beginning?

414
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,180
Do you really think I've only planned this far ahead?

415
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,910
 20 Years later in Sangju 

416
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:48,530
 -Father, father! Here, here!  
 - Did you bring it?

417
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,030
This is that famous—

418
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,200
Okay, okay! This is it! Here, hold onto the chicken.

419
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,360
If you feed it this, its insides will probably go crazy.

420
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,630
Is that the problem here? We have to win!

421
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,240
Just help out!

422
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,360
- Did you put it in? 
 - Yeah I did!

423
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,240
Eat it, eat it! You need to gain some strength.

424
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,980
Look at its eyes. It already looks quite vicious.

425
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,990
It ate it, so that's good. See that black one there?

426
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,590
Knock him down in one blow, got it?

427
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,300
Come on! Get him! Get him!

428
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,950
- That's right! That's right!
- Yeah, that's my cock!

429
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,810
Yeah! That's right!

430
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,890
What? What's going on?

431
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,010
Aigoo! What just happened?

432
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,710
Tell him to get up!

433
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,640
Get up!

434
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,070
I think I'll just have a piece of the wing.

435
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,440
He was alive just a few minutes ago...

436
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,530
What will we eat now? We have no source of income now.

437
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:11,490
You have your tujeon!  (traditional Korean card game)  Dad's specialty.

438
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,000
You always say you're "Joseon's best tujeon player, Baek Man Geum!"

439
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,420
but because you're not playing it any more, we have nothing, don't you think so?

440
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,720
What nonsense are you saying?

441
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,990
Baek Man Geum? Are you Baek Man Geum?

442
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:38,720
In a month's time, there will be a big game in Hanyang!  (Hangyang: Seoul) 

443
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,100
Stop.

444
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,470
How did it go?

445
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:05,190
I spread the news everywhere to all the big-shot gamblers in all eight provinces.

446
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,950
But I think even some small-fry gamblers might be coming as well.

447
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,790
But, what is your reasoning behind creating this big match?

448
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,790
That's none of your business.

449
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,700
 Joseon Tujeon Tournament in Hanyang
(today's Seoul) 

450
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,370
- Let's go to Hanyang. 
 - I'm not going.

451
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,100
- I said let's go! 
 - I told you I'm not going!

452
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,660
Just this once! It says there will be a big game in Hanyang.

453
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,610
Big or not,

454
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,430
- I'm not going. 
 - Oh my gosh.

455
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:42,220
How long do we have to stay and rot here in this backwater?

456
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,260
If I'm born as a man,

457
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,520
shouldn't I go to Hanyang at least once before I die?

458
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,370
Ya! Is Hanyang the next city over?

459
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,640
-Hanyang, Hanyang- Stop nagging me about it. 
 -Aish.

460
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,820
Aish?!

461
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,380
Your father said no.

462
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,580
Your father won't play tujeon anymore.

463
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,890
Grandfather, why are you like this?

464
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,880
And also, Father, you said

465
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:07,640
when I turn 20, you'll make me a  yangban  (a noble), and that you'll get me a beautiful bride too.

466
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,100
If I keep believing you, what will that make me?

467
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,380
An idiot?

468
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,590
How long are we going to live like this, without a roof or land to call our own?

469
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,190
How about marriage? You don't want me to get married?!

470
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,470
Of course you have to get married.

471
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,190
Well, anyway, we don't even have the money to get to Hanyang.

472
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,230
If we get money, can we go?

473
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,900
If we want to go to Hanyang, we need at least 100 nyang.

474
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,290
100 nyang?

475
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,400
If it's for a chance to go to Hanyang, of course I can get 100 nyang easily.

476
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,660
What a load of bullcrap. Where can you even get 100 nyang?

477
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,080
Father, I will get 100 nyang right now.

478
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,740
And when I do, don't say we can't go.

479
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,490
- Leader! Merchants! 
 - Where?

480
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,150
Itinerant merchants are passing by that narrow path over there!

481
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,510
Hey guys! Get your weapons!

482
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,820
Hurry! Hurry!

483
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,330
You're too slow!

484
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,460
Wow, why is there so much stuff?

485
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:44,280
Hey, what are you doing here?

486
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:52,530
- Ah that is— 
 - Do I look like an idiotic fool that doesn't know his own subordinates?

487
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,510
Hey, guys!

488
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,210
Yes, Sir!

489
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,700
My father told me not to use my fists...

490
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,920
Catch him!

491
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,620
Catch that man!

492
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,360
Come back here!

493
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,720
Catch him!

494
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:47,100
We're going to Hanyang with Gae Ttong. I don't even know if I made the right choice.

495
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,490
Hey, this is pretty good. Try some!

496
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,670
What are you pigging out on sh*t like that? You'll get diarrhea.

497
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,880
Oh my! Oh my!

498
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,250
- Here take this! 
 - What is this?

499
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,310
You said if I got 100 nyang we'd going to Hanyang!

500
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,640
Where... Where did you get this?

501
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,540
Who are they?

502
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,850
They're the owners of that money!

503
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:12,710
- Just run! 
- Hey, you bastard!

504
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,250
Gae Ttong! Gae Ttong!

505
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,990
They're barbarians!

506
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:18,030
What are you doing now?

507
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,750
Aigoo! My foot hurts so much!

508
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,630
This little...

509
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,700
Aigoo! That hurts! It hurts!

510
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,330
Hey, you little kid. Just get up!

511
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,770
I can't! I can't go on any longer!

512
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:34,860
How much are the horses?

513
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,060
My foot!

514
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:45,890
♫  In one day's travel to one island to the next— ♫

515
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,690
How are we going to get to Hanyang at this rate?

516
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,180
Go faster! Row like this!

517
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:01,810
Hey, you little bastard! Hurry up and grab it!

518
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,990
Your Highness, isn't that a swallow's nest?

519
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:21,730
Yes it is. It seems a very welcoming guest will appear.
 Seok Bin Choe 

520
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,710
Joseon's best tajja player, Gae Ttong

521
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:44,180
has finally arrived at Hanyang!

522
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,100
It's Hanyang!

523
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,140
Noonim!!!  (older sister) 

524
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,290
- Did I wake you up?
- Come over here.

525
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:05,020
But over there right now...

526
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,240
Didn't I tell you never to disturb me when I'm taking a nap?

527
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,740
No, that's not it! That man came!

528
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,230
- That man? 
 - Yes!

529
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:18,390
You know, that man who wiped us out last time!

530
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,020
That rotten bastard!

531
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,660
Where? Where is that bastard?!

532
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,500
Wow you're so amazing, My Lord!

533
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,220
I'm sorry, but this is all mine now!

534
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:55,300
 To our gisaengs, he is a desirable man. But he is a troublemaker among troublemakers, a playboy among playboys. 

535
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:03,080
 In short, he is Joseon's most troublesome man. 

536
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,600
 At the village near the eastern walls, there is a stretch of poop across this wall 

537
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:25,130
♫ After much investigation, it turned out to be our dog poop! ♫

538
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,680
What are you doing here, Gae Ttong?

539
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,010
Hurry up and come.

540
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,560
Ah, seriously! He keeps calling me "Gae Ttong."

541
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,810
What do you mean "Gae Ttong"?

542
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,350
There we go!

543
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,940
Hey, you little brat!

544
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,760
- Aigoo! Hurry up and come! 
 - Ouch! That hurts!

545
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,960
- Aigoo, our Gae Ttong eats very well.

546
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,880
Even as a newborn baby, the only thing Gae Ttong was good at was eating.

547
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,190
You keep calling me Gae Ttong! People will seriously think I'm a mutt!  (word play: gae ttong = dog crap, ttong gae = crap dog) 

548
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,010
And also, who made it possible for us to eat in luxury right now?

549
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:16,490
This is all thanks to me who stole the money from the bandits!

550
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:20,810
Luxury? Is that what you should be saying right now?

551
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,910
You are costing us more than twice as much as you stole from the bandits.

552
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,620
And you're talking about being luxurious.

553
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,510
Well, it doesn't necessarily have to mean that we're luxurious...

554
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,380
Stop causing more trouble!

555
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,260
Trouble? What do you mean, "causing trouble"?

556
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,090
Ah okay! Whatever! I'm in a good mood anyway!

557
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:42,590
As a commemoration of us being here at Hanyang, I'll turn my father into a rich man.

558
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,510
What do you want, you brat?

559
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:51,690
Money. I need money if I want to be gambling, trading, or  doing anything here.

560
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,970
Ah that's right! Money!

561
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,360
Of course you need money.

562
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,040
Let's see. I'll give you some money.

563
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,720
Here!

564
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,970
What is this?

565
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:10,660
Since you're Joseon's best tajja player,  one nyang shouldn't be too much of a problem here in Hanyang, right?

566
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,450
I see how it is.

567
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,140
All right, just watch.

568
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:20,920
I, Gae Ttong, will turn this one nyang into 100 nyang or 1000 nyang.

569
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,530
Where are you trying to go now?

570
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,290
Ow! Ow! I said that hurts!

571
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,580
Aigoo, you little brat!

572
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:33,010
Seriously! If my precious ear falls off, are you going to reattach it, Gramps?

573
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,280
What is this place, anyway?

574
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,030
Wow. Is this place even a house or a stable?

575
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:47,520
Hey you brat, this is where your mother and I used to live.

576
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,830
Mother?

577
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,100
You're living well, right?

578
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,750
Honey! Honey!

579
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:31,430
What are you doing? If you returned home, you should first clean up.

580
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,980
It seems now you've finally matured a bit, you rotten bastard.

581
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,320
All right, let's clean up.

582
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,830
Your mother was really pretty...

583
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:45,210
Why that little! Where are you going now?!

584
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,310
Gae Ttong!

585
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:30,650
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

586
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,140
 Jackpot 

587
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,760
From now on, your name will be Baek Dae Gil!

588
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,200
If that's all the money you have on you, even if it's one nyang, you should take good care of it.

589
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,900
- Who are you staring at so intently? Is she even your lover? 
 - What?

590
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,750
Next time I will cut your neck.

591
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:58,630
Do you wish to kill me? After all, I'm the one who exterminated your family, right?

592
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:02,850
The thing that moves the world is not the King or the nobility, it's money.

593
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,720
If I live like this or like that, what difference does it make?!

594
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,960
Tonight, with the death of one man, we will start the operation we have planned for a long time.

595
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,640
If you want to die, then bring it on! I will take you all on!
