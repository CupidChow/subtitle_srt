1
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,170
 Episode 14 

2
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,490
Halt!

3
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,600
What're you doing?

4
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,160
Dam Seo you, what are you thinking?

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,550
Father? Father are you here?

6
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,940
Go. I'll ask you about your motives later.

7
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,920
Hurry and go for now.

8
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,150
Look here!

9
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,210
Father...

10
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,100
Father...

11
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,170
Father.

12
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,200
Come to your senses, Father!

13
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,310
Father!

14
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,410
It wasn't me.

15
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,840
How could you do this...

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,170
to my father....

17
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,530
I'm telling you it's not me.

18
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,720
I'll find outwho the culprit is and why he killed him.

19
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,160
Head Master!

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,790
How can you try to shift the blame?

21
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,580
Capture him now.

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,910
Murderer.

23
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,120
I won't leave him be.

24
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,210
Though he did pledge loyalty to this fellow named Baek Dae Gil,

25
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,590
something doesn't seem quite right.

26
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,430
Seeing that even that awful Ace of Sixes died after losing his gambling house,

27
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,960
it makes me think this fellow Baek Dae Gil's goals don't just end with the gambling houses themselves.

28
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,270
Perhaps Swindler Golsa also?

29
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,840
Look here everyone.

30
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,890
Merchant Golsa is dead.

31
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,570
He is dead?

32
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,790
  Lee In Jwa 

33
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,590
The culprit is none other than Baek Dae Gil, no?

34
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,110
That fellow Baek Dae Gil's barbaric deeds will not end with just this incident.

35
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,030
On top of that, he'll soon be arrested on charges of homicide.

36
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,550
Then the only people left who can be responsible for this Mapo Market will be

37
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,390
the daughter of Swindler Golsa, who is ignorant of worldly affairs,

38
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,350
and me, Lee In Jwa.

39
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,230
Just two of us. How is this?

40
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,870
Will you be with me?

41
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,650
Or will you...?!

42
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,970
You said you saw the culprit?

43
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,680
Yes.

44
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,840
It is the fellow named Baek Dae Gil.

45
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,780
You just left me to sleep in late?

46
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,020
- I did try a few times to wake you up. 
 - Does it look okay?

47
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,790
It's brilliant, Sire.

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,530
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.

49
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,910
How were you so late?

50
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,450
The morning royal audience is over.

51
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,380
What happened to the proposal

52
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,800
to ban the market mercantile monopoly?

53
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,350
Market Mercantile Monopoly

54
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,300
I definitely told you to obtain evidence.
  (King Sookjong) 

55
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,800
The evidence was already obtain... 
  (Prince Yeoning, future Yeongjo) 

56
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,000
Your Majesty, though your loyal servant has received from His Highness Prince Yeoning 
  (Chief Minister Kim Chang Jip) 

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,170
and examined the ledgers listing the alleged collusion

58
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,500
among the chartered merchants and court ministers

59
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,000
they had no weight as evidence, so I burned them.

60
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,990
Your Excellency.

61
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,090
Since there is insufficient evidence,

62
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,340
Your Highness Prince Yeoning's proposal to ban the market mercantile privilege

63
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,690
should be appropriately dismissed.

64
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,640
Your Excellency

65
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,730
What exactly have you done?

66
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,030
Burning the evidence that was obtained with such difficulty.

67
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,520
In return for me helping you by influencing the Capital Bureau,

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,460
didn't Your Highness promise

69
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,130
to hand over all authority regarding the ledgers?

70
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,950
But that was—

71
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,390
If you delegated it to me, remove yourself from the matter.

72
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,360
Why exactly are you doing this?

73
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,800
It's for your own good, Your Highness.

74
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
For my sake?

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,450
Your Highness is the cornerstone of our Noron faction.

76
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm saying you cannot collapse over something as small as the market mercantile monopoly.

77
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,670
For me,

78
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,090
For my sake, you are holding me back.

79
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,750
Aren't those two things completely contradictory?

80
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,810
Your Highness, do you think that banning the market mercantile privilege

81
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,060
would cause the collapse of the Soron (faction)?

82
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,560
Do you think you can throw that demonic fellow Lee In Jwa into prison?

83
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,110
It is a mistake to believe so.

84
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,770
Rather, only you will be hurt, Your Highness.

85
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,760
I will not tolerate them. Ever.

86
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,140
Never.

87
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,180
It is the&nbsp;will of Her Highness Sook Bin.

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,300
Your Highness.

89
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,320
What did you just—

90
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,000
I said it was the will of Her Highness Sook Bin.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,170
Why would the Royal Mother...

92
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,560
Do you truly not know? Why? 
   (Crown Prince Yoon, future Gyeongjong) 

93
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,680
As the proposal to ban the market mercantile privilege becomes a larger issue,

94
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,790
the court ministers will aim for you,

95
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,390
and as a result it will be you who ends up shackling your own self.

96
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,810
 Crown Prince, please block Prince Yeoning. 

97
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,440
Your Highness, since Prince Yeoning's resolve is absolutely firm,

98
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,460
it's not something that I alone can do something about.

99
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,050
 Royal Noble Consort Sook of the Choi clan  

100
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,840
Your Excellency.

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,390
If&nbsp;the Crown Prince holds Prince Yeoning dear,

102
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,810
it is not that there is no way.

103
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,610
What would that method be?

104
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,890
The Crown Prince will meet with His Majesty the King,

105
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,660
and get him to promise the reinstatement of Prince Yeoning's title.

106
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,400
Then...  I will take care of the events that will occur thereafter,

107
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,710
You should stop at this point.

108
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,720
Then I will reinstate your position.

109
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,960
The King has already approved of it.

110
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,880
 What is your true intention? 

111
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,860
 Do you want to save or kill Geum (Prince Yeoning)? 

112
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,490
 In the future Prince Yeoning will become an obstacle during  your rule as a regent and when you ascend the throne. 

113
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,320
  Why don't you just let him be? 

114
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,820
  Even if he goes around alone like a crazy person and dies, 

115
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:47,150
 for you, Crown Prince, it wouldn't be too bad a situation 

116
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,690
 I am an older brother to my younger brother, Prince Yeoning,  

117
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,850
 as well as his benevolent liege lord. 

118
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,450
 I will stop Yeoning's actions, and reinstate his position 

119
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:09,290
However, I am unable to accept it.

120
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,390
If you gain one thing, you concede one thing.

121
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,890
That is politics, Your Highness.

122
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,110
Royal Mother, why did you involve yourself in my matter?

123
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,230
What mother in the world leaves her son in danger?

124
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:47,310
If you  anger the court ministers, you will not survive, Prince.

125
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:56,010
Prince Yeoning, do you truly intend to continue and  lose everything?

126
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,970
Even if I lose everything, I will do it.  I must do it.

127
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,470
Please.

128
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,930
Please stop.

129
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,510
This is a plea from your mother.

130
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:17,510
I beg you to grant this earnest plea.

131
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,630
The days of your mother pleading with you are numbered now.

132
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:33,470
And this may be the last time I will scold you.

133
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,850
Royal Mother, why do you speak so?

134
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,790
Her illness is grave and there is nothing more we can do.

135
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,710
What kind of...

136
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:06,550
 If it's for Royal Mother, I can give up my life for you.  

137
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,070
 However, I cannot stop here. 

138
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,210
Did the mice come because the repository is rotten?

139
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,950
Or did the repository become rotten because the mice came in?

140
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:43,270
Prime Minister, how much do you know about Lee In Jwa?

141
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,390
Your clout is quite startling.

142
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,310
Did you meet Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip personally? 
  (Jo Il Soo, Junior Deputy Right Minister.) 

143
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,950
What power do I have to influence someone so inflexible and straightforward  as Prime Minister Kim Chang Jip?

144
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,270
It's just that the King and the Crown Prince stand opposite of Prince Yeonging.

145
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:10,710
And Sook Bin and the Noron who worry for Prince Yeoning all share a common thread.

146
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,670
Indeed, Lee In Jwa, you are...

147
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,990
But what do you plan to do with Baek Dae Gil, who crushed Swindler Golsa?

148
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,150
Isn't this akin to you losing a leg, in the end?

149
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,190
Would that really be the case?

150
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,650
 The merchants under Swindler Golsa's management 

151
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,710
 have all been taken over by me. As for Baek Dae Gil 

152
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,770
 he will soon be imprisoned. 

153
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,690
This doesn't look like the expression of someone who's going to break the house again. Why're you here?

154
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,990
Where's Dam Seo?

155
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,250
Why do you look for Miss here?  Is Miss back?

156
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,030
 Hwang Jin Gi 

157
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,290
What is it?

158
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,750
What is it, I said.

159
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,370
Move aside for him.

160
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,530
Who is this?

161
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,870
This man is none other than Baek Dae Gil.

162
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,710
Baek Dae Gil?

163
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,590
I have a momentary business to tend to with him, so please go ahead and leave first.

164
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,150
Where's Dam Seo?

165
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,810
What do you mean Dam Seo?

166
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,770
What are you talking about? You didn't send her?

167
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,330
Dam Seo has appeared?

168
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,990
You're saying that Dam Seo appeared at the scene of Swindler Golsa's murder?

169
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,890
How fast rumors fly. It was you, not Lee In Jwa? Swindler Golsa—

170
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,290
Weren't you, Baek Dae Gil, the one who killed Swindler Golsa?

171
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,970
Dam Seo is not here, so leave.

172
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,610
Dam Seo has returned...

173
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,850
  I am no longer able to serve you, Master 

174
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:29,450
  According to my principles, I will go my separate way. 

175
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,690
Dam Seo has...

176
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,010
Did you see Dam Seo?

177
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,950
Dam Seo killed them:

178
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,830
 Seoso Gate's Ace of Sixes and Mapo's Swindler Golsa. 

179
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,210
So? What are you going to do by finding Dam Seo?

180
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,790
I see that you know where Dam Seo is.

181
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,390
 There's a small temple that she frequents. 

182
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:31,270
 If she's back, she's probably staying there. 

183
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,310
What? Swindler Golsa has died? Is it true?

184
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,470
It's a clear fact for sure. In addition ...

185
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,690
I must check with my own two eyes.

186
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:25,070
It's a sword wound from a single strike. It's certain that it was done by someone skilled in the martial arts.

187
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,470
Baek Dae Gil.

188
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,790
It was surely him.

189
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,050
Did you see it... with your own eyes?

190
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,770
I did. With my own two eyes.

191
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,150
I will ask once more.

192
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,750
Did you see clearly with your own two eyes?

193
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,570
I said I saw it. Capture him immediately.

194
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,590
Right now.

195
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,630
This case

196
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,890
will be taken on by me.

197
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,050
  Office of the Inspector General- Commander 

198
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:20,490
  When Prince Yeoning is seen in action, don't interfere, just keep watch. 

199
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,670
Ask me first what you want to know.

200
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,140
Did you kill the Ace of Sixes and Swindler Golsa?

201
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,490
Did you come here to ask questions, or to confirm your suspicions?

202
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,580
Even if I told you, would you believe me?

203
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,410
That Ace of Sixes, who was wicked all his life...

204
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,340
deserved to die.

205
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,960
Swinder Golsa. That man also did evil acts...

206
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,220
I wanted to deliver the judgment to him myself.

207
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,290
But... it wasn't me.

208
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,430
If you weren't the one who killed him, then just who did?

209
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,760
I told you the truth, yet you don't believe me.

210
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,410
If you aren't going to report me to the royal police, just leave.

211
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,830
What on earth happened...

212
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,810
What on earth made you like this? What happened to you?

213
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,150
You will find out soon enough.

214
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,360
The reason why your father died,

215
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
and why my teacher has not killed you.

216
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,350
There will come a time when you stand at a crossroad and have to make a choice,

217
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,880
just like I, who abandoned my teacher's beliefs, did.

218
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,820
Whether you choose to stand beside him and go together,

219
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,770
or you choose to face him and fight him.

220
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,220
 You will find out soon enough, Dae Gil,  

221
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,460
 that you are the son of the King. 

222
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,660
Seol Im!

223
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,750
Seol Im!

224
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,990
Just where... Where the heck did she go, leaving one shoe behind?

225
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,310
Aigoo, that person!

226
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,380
Wait, you came back alone? You haven't seen where Seol Im went off to?

227
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,500
Seol Im?

228
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,140
 Dog Blade 

229
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,500
When you're with me, don't ever turn you back towards me.

230
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,890
There is no use in waiting, because no one will come looking for you.

231
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,970
I left a letter.

232
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,000
A letter?

233
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,250
 Hey Dae Gil, I'm thankful for what you've done for me. Please stay healthy. 

234
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,350
Hey, I'm sure something bad happened to her.

235
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,510
Otherwise why would she leave one of her shoes behind?

236
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,750
Hey, Gramps. I'll go find Seol Im, so you just wait here for a bit.

237
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,330
Where do you plan on going—

238
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,440
If you plan on fleeing right now,

239
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,980
know that it will make the situation worse.

240
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,020
Baek Dae Gil. Arrest this man.

241
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,750
Yes, Sir!

242
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,010
Your Highness... Why on earth are you doing this?

243
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,470
Just what crime did Dae Gil commit?

244
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,840
Just as you predicted, Prince Yeoning took charge of this case.

245
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,030
And had Baek Dae Gil arrested.

246
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,450
If he is convicted of the murder, he won't be able to escape the death penalty.

247
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,880
I'm quite curious right now

248
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,940
as to what kind of expression Consort Sook would have from receiving my present.

249
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,240
What did you say? You're telling me that child has committed murder,

250
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,080
and now he's in prison?

251
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,310
They say you should strike while the iron is hot.

252
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,930
So this instant, gather all of the Soron ministers

253
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,360
as well as the Mapo merchants.

254
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,150
My Liege! Do you actually plan to kill Baek Dae Gil?

255
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,840
He has a longer lifeline than yours, so do you think he will die that easily?

256
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,270
 What will you do now, King? 

257
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,090
 One of your bloodline is about to die. 

258
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,470
Baek Dae Gil... So he committed murder,

259
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,570
and Prince Yeoning arrested him.

260
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,420
In any case, this meeting between the two brothers...

261
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,450
is definitely not a coincidence.

262
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,690
Ha, this is quite...

263
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,660
Does that Lee In Jwa,

264
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,430
who is a petty bug, actually dare

265
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,520
to provoke me, or is he...

266
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,490
scheming something?

267
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,500
What happened?

268
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,510
Hurry and tell me.

269
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,420
 But it wasn't me. 

270
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,640
I didn't kill him.

271
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,350
What you just said... Can I believe that?

272
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,170
In front of this sword that His Majesty has entrusted to you.

273
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,610
Can you swear upon that?

274
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,440
I can swear that I didn't do it even without that sword.

275
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,200
If that's the case...

276
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,400
Then this means someone came before you did, finished off Swinder Golsa,

277
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,930
and framed you for it.

278
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:19,120
By any chance... Did you see or let someone slip by?

279
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,900
I didn't see that person. I saw nothing.

280
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,310
This is a request. Please don't make any ruckus, and wait here quietly.

281
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,790
I'll do whatever I can to find the culprit.

282
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,760
So even without this sword...

283
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,440
I will also trust you.

284
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:04,520
 I didn't see anything. I didn't see you, Dam Seo. 

285
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,050
Did you... witness the murder?

286
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,320
I didn't see the moment the murder took place.

287
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,270
- Then why are you... 
 - Because I am not mistaken,

288
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,360
I'm sure that Baek Dae Gil

289
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,550
is no doubt the culprit.

290
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,820
Were there no signs of external entry?

291
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,080
By chance,

292
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,960
was the window open?

293
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,740
- The window was open, but... 
 - Then...

294
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,500
it's possible that someone snuck in through the window, killed Swindler Golsa,

295
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,140
and framed Baek Dae Gil.

296
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,700
All of the evidence points towards Baek Dae Gil,

297
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,260
but just why is Your Highness

298
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,330
trying to protect Baek Dae Gil, who is the prime suspect?

299
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,620
Because Baek Dae Gil is someone I trust.

300
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,410
The hatchet you trust is the one that stabs your foot. 
 (trust makes way for treachery) 

301
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,080
My father, until the moment he died,

302
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,080
had this gambling card in his grasp.

303
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,880
 Ten 

304
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,020
If Baek Dae Gil is not the culprit,

305
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,230
why did my father hold onto this until the moment he died?

306
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,340
I promise you this.

307
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:40,710
The one that killed your father will pay what he deserves.

308
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,050
 Royal Mother. 

309
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,470
You won't cough up your crime at once!

310
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,740
I need to have committed a crime to cough it up or spit it out.

311
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,740
I don't kill people.

312
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,920
So that bastard hasn't gotten his wits together.

313
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,770
Tighten the coil.

314
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,930
Halt.

315
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,240
Your Highness, this man has committed murder.

316
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,140
Before I chop off your limbs,

317
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,510
get out of my sight.

318
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,570
Your Highness.

319
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,700
Back away.

320
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,300
 Child. 

321
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,670
Are you all right?

322
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,520
Are you all right?

323
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,440
Your Highness.

324
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,400
Tell me.

325
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,560
Did you truly commit murder?

326
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,510
I didn't.

327
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,520
But how is it you've been arrested like this?

328
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,750
Your Highness, why do you...

329
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,210
I heard that you are Prince Yeoning's friend.

330
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,360
In this world,

331
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,170
his one and only.

332
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,300
Who did this to you?

333
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,260
Who framed you for murder?

334
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,100
Though I suspect someone,

335
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,610
I am not certain.

336
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,670
Tell me.

337
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,970
It's someone called the White-Faced Scholar.

338
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,760
Lee In Jwa?

339
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,340
He did this to you?

340
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,950
Do you know Lee In Jwa?

341
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,170
I will never forgive him.

342
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,390
No matter what it takes,

343
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,990
I will end his life.

344
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,120
Just a little more.

345
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,280
Bear this just a little more and wait.

346
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,610
 This mother of yours 

347
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,470
 will surely protect you this time. 

348
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:52,140
 Year of Gyeyu (1693), Month 10, Day 13.  Whose birth pillars are these? 

349
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,870
 It is not a matter for the Prince to worry about. 

350
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,740
What are your birth year, day, and time?

351
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,270
Is that important right now?

352
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,040
It is important.

353
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,460
I think I heard I was born in the 10th month.

354
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,930
Year of Gyeyu (1693), month 10.

355
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,020
And the day?

356
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,640
I don't know.

357
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,910
I've never celebrated the likes of a birthday.

358
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,250
And I don't care either.

359
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,120
But why are you asking about that suddenly?

360
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,090
 Because I saw it for the first time. 

361
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:39,780
 The image of Royal Mother looking so enraged. 

362
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,680
 His age is the same as my deceased older brother. 

363
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,250
 And born in the same month as well.  

364
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,080
 Baek Dae Gil. 

365
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,930
 It can't be... 

366
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,940
The King's movements are disquieting?

367
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,610
Yes, My Liege.

368
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,150
What do you mean?

369
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,320
As soon as Baek Dae Gil was locked up in jail,

370
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,110
he summoned the cabinet ministers of Personnel, Law Enforcement and Military Affairs.

371
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,400
 Afterwards, also the Censor General, Office of Inspection, Office of Special Advisers, 

372
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,110
 as well summoning the senior ministers above the third rank from the Three Offices, 

373
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,510
 asking about your movements. 

374
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,800
Tell me.

375
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,940
The atrocity of Lee In Jwa's deeds is limitless.

376
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,880
As the high ministers of the Three Offices, how is it

377
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,720
that you have not said a word about it all this time?

378
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,830
Whose subjects are you, to be exact?

379
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,980
 So the king is trying to pull out the sword. 

380
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:07,200
He's perceived me to be the mastermind behind the framing of Baek Dae Gil.

381
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,420
He's gathered the high ministers to create an atmosphere

382
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,110
with the intention to strike me, Lee In Jwa.

383
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,240
My Liege.  Then it's dangerous.

384
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,730
But the Great Cause hasn't even begun.

385
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,530
Well that, of course,

386
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,300
needs to wait

387
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,700
and we'll find out.

388
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,590
 Your Majesty, save him. 

389
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,760
All these are appeals

390
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,090
asking me to behead that child Baek Dae Gil,

391
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,600
from the Soron high ministers.

392
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,380
Since this is what it looks like inside the palace, what goes on outside the palace is obvious without having to look.

393
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,410
How is it that even you can't control yourself

394
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,100
and are this restless?

395
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,440
Arresting a murder suspect and torturing him are not novel things.

396
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Why was it a matter that required your going personally to the interrogation site to make a ruckus?

397
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,340
However, Your Majesty...

398
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,180
Yeong Soo.

399
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,310
He's already all grown.

400
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,540
Without needing you to interfere and come forth in every matter,

401
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,080
he's grown up.

402
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,840
You are also aware of it.

403
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,100
To kill him or to save him...

404
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,450
I will see to it.

405
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,610
Don't get involved anymore.

406
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,160
Do you understand?

407
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,990
You'll get hurt.

408
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,980
If you involve yourself further,

409
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,250
you will get hurt, I said.

410
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,610
Lend me your hand.

411
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,770
You're not even feeling well.

412
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,690
So just secure your lock on your room tightly,

413
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,300
and do not wander outside of that room.

414
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,010
Ever. Do you understand?

415
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,460
Yes,

416
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,000
Your Majesty.

417
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,930
Royal Father.

418
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,660
Follow me.

419
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,620
You...

420
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,650
Do you want to catch Lee In Jwa?

421
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,040
Just why is Royal Father asking me this?

422
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,480
Then go and catch him.

423
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,850
This task is given too suddenly to your son—

424
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,670
I don't need to hear  your reasons.

425
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,800
What reason does a tiger need to catch a fox?

426
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,480
All you need to do is just rip and shred that fox apart.

427
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,830
Bullseye!

428
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,270
I'm giving you...

429
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,640
an opportunity.

430
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,500
When you're just catching something like that, I don't think I need to get involved.

431
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,430
Bring him, the person who will become the hunting dog,

432
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,300
Baek Dae Gil.

433
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,390
That bastard Kim Che Geon... Just what is he doing right now?

434
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,820
Is someone speaking ill of me? Why is my ear so itchy?
 Kim Che Geon 

435
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,890
It's time for us to all rise and stand.

436
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,250
For these past 20 years,

437
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,570
we and the comrades from the eight provinces,

438
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:58,540
who have lived in hiding ourselves and waited for this day, to rise and stand together.

439
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,070
 Year of Mushin (around  1728) 

440
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,510
Tell Mother Hwanggu,

441
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,100
the time has come.

442
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,230
Yes, My Liege.

443
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,560
King...

444
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,970
I came to confirm something.

445
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:47,030
I wanted to hear the answer directly from you, whether or not you really killed my father.

446
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,460
Think about it well.

447
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,120
There is definitely something you overlooked.

448
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,480
The person who gains the most from the death of Swindler Golsa.

449
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,560
 (Or will you ) 

450
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,860
Or someone who could've been commissioned by him.

451
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,360
And if that's not the case,

452
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,880
the person who gains the most from seeing me put in prison.

453
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,480
I'm sure Swindler Golsa was holding something in his hand before he died.

454
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,630
A gambling tag.

455
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,920
Baek Dae Gil.

456
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,390
This is the indisputable evidence that you are the culprit.

457
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,950
No. Now I know

458
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,450
who the culprit is.

459
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,260
What Swindler Golsa was clenching until his death.

460
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,320
The person this gambling card points to.

461
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,240
The person who defeated Swindler Golsa's sound swindle.

462
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,360
There was only one person who did that.

463
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,810
 What are you doing? 

464
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,330
 If you've come, you should enter. 

465
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,620
 Dog Blade. 

466
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,110
 What's the matter? 

467
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,690
 Let's not hold any resentment towards each other. 

468
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,980
Dog Blade.

469
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,510
Do you have any evidence that Dog Blade is the culprit?

470
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,340
I'll have to find the evidence. Starting now.

471
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,510
Are you trying to get out of it without any evidence?

472
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,770
Do you want to believe that I am the culprit?

473
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,940
It doesn't matter who the culprit is, because I'm sure you hold resentment towards me for the death of your father.

474
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,140
Because you want to get back the gambling house that I took away.

475
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,830
And if that's not the case,

476
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,820
are you scared of Dog Blade?

477
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,570
It seems you don't understand.

478
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:25,730
Dog Blade is not just a mere swindling gambler.

479
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:31,120
He is the head of an assassin group that kills for money.

480
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,440
A hundred nyangs for a lowly person.

481
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,270
Two hundred nyangs for a commoner.

482
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,080
Five hundred nyangs for a noble person is what I heard.

483
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,820
A junior 6th-rank non-cabinet minister is 1,000 nyangs.

484
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,730
A thousand nyangs.

485
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,210
I'll wager all my assets.

486
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,610
Just kill him.

487
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,160
So then?

488
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,500
You're scared of that Dog Blade so you will just sit and watch?

489
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,580
No, it's only your supposition

490
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,180
that Dog Blade is the culprit.

491
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:29,370
You're homing in on Dog Blade as the culprit, and just like you killed the Ace of Sixes and my father,

492
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,880
you're trying to strike Dog Blade.

493
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,240
I'll say this again.

494
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,300
Unless clear evidence appears,

495
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,040
Baek Dae Gil, you are the culprit,

496
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,420
and that belief shall not change.

497
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,560
I'll change that belief for you.

498
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,180
What matter brings you...

499
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,430
Baek Dae Gil.  I've come to release him.

500
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,560
Your Highness.  Release the offender?

501
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,550
Didn't Itell you this?

502
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,510
I'm damn lucky.

503
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,740
The apology.

504
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,790
I'll do that after I've captured the culprit,

505
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,790
Choi Yeon Hwa.

506
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,670
You've arrived.

507
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:54,120
Joseon's #1 Mapo trading rights have fallen into my hands.

508
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,460
How am I to express my gratitude?

509
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,090
This is all thanks to your slaying of Swindler Golsa and capturing Baek Dae Gil.

510
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,140
 Golsa? 

511
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,930
 What joke is the White-Faced Scholar playing here? 

512
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:36,310
 Is it not your job to kill whoever it is, when paid? 

513
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:41,250
 Today, Swindler Golsa was cracked by Baek Dae Gil. 

514
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,410
 Hence, the Mapo trading rights that Swindler Golsa had held 

515
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,340
 will go to Baek Dae Gil. 

516
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,910
 This isn't such a welcome change to you, or to me, is it? 

517
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:55,630
 If it's you, it shouldn't be difficult. 

518
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:01,570
 But I am not an assassin like you.  

519
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,070
 Well, I leave it to your care. 

520
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,760
 Oh. 

521
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,830
 That woman you had by your side. 

522
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:35,460
 That girl seems to be with Baek Dae Gil. 

523
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,800
 I wonder if you know about it. 

524
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:08,070
It's possible that Baek Dae Gil will seek you tonight.

525
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,280
How will a guy who's locked up in jail do that?

526
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,810
He's the hunting dog released by the King.

527
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:19,240
Baek Dae Gil and the King, how are they linked?

528
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,510
Their link is deeper than deep.

529
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,570
But...

530
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,820
I have summoned some spectators for your sake.

531
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,120
Tonight shall be a rather clamorous night.

532
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,170
You!

533
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:58,850
Are you comprehending my words properly?

534
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

535
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,080
Tonight, before the bell rings at Haeshi (9–11 pm),

536
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,890
I will definitely bring the true culprit under arrest.

537
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,080
Prince Yeoning.

538
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

539
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,320
If that rascal can't get it done properly,

540
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,280
how will you take  responsibility?

541
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:26,530
You voluntarily took on this case, didn't you?

542
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,140
So you'll have to pay the price.

543
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,920
Everything.

544
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,900
I will lay all of it down.

545
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,470
Everything?

546
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,230
Do you still remember

547
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,290
what I said to you?

548
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,080
 For that friend of yours, 

549
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,200
 can you lay your life down? 

550
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,420
 For those people of yours,  

551
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,670
 this throne, 

552
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:11,060
 can you give it up?  

553
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,860
 Mark my words. 

554
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:21,280
 If you can't, then he's not your friend, 

555
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,060
 and those are not your people either. 

556
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,110
I remember,

557
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,780
Your Majesty.

558
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,790
Is that right?

559
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,380
So it is, you say.

560
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,540
You will lay everything down.

561
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,340
Interesting.

562
00:55:55,790 --> 00:56:00,070
If you fail to arrest the true culprit, Baek Dae Gil,

563
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,840
tomorrow, as soon as the sun rises,

564
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,000
you will be beheaded.

565
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,280
Mark these words.

566
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

567
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,370
This time, you are alone.  Will you be able to accomplish it?

568
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,330
Your Highness,

569
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:38,090
this time  it's not even necessary for you to put  a spoon on my table, but it seems that it'll  just fall into your lap.

570
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,270
Take this.

571
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,520
Sharp, at Haeshi (9–11 pm). If you're a moment late...

572
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,000
I won't be late, so set aside your worries, Your Highness.

573
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:07,350
Oh, right.

574
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,600
I remembered it.

575
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,070
I don't know why in the world you are curious,

576
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:20,150
but my birth date, is the Year of Gyeyu (1693), month 10, day 6.

577
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,700
Year of Gyeyu (1693).

578
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,430
Month 10, day 6.

579
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,140
The six-month-premature older brother.

580
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,400
His birth date.

581
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,470
Baek Dae Gil.

582
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,070
Are you truly

583
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,260
my older brother?

584
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,650
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

585
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,750
