1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,640
Then you won't care...

2
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,850
if I kill Swindler Golsa.

3
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,990
I'm sure you've heard the rumors about the destruction of the Ace of Sixes.

4
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,350
The one who destroyed the Ace of Sixes was me, Baek Dae Gil. 
   Episode 13 

5
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,280
It was you, wearing the mask of the White-Faced Scholar

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,850
and destroying the gambling houses in the eight provinces.

7
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,760
Why? Did you change your mind?

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,430
No. You are making vain efforts.

9
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,710
No matter how hard you try,

10
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,180
you can't destroy him. That man, Lee In Jwa—

11
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,530
That man, Lee In Jwa! I know him better than you.

12
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,080
I have already confronted him so many times and been beaten so many times as well.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,920
- Then, why again? 
 - Because I have to confront him.

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,360
If I don't, nothing will change.

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,100
I also know your heart, that you want to save your father.

16
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,290
But, if you just sit still like this, nothing will be solved.

17
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,800
Keep in mind that if you don't do anything,

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,410
nothing will change.

19
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,550
 Aigoo, it was good. 

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,650
Seol Im.

21
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,550
 The baekhodaesal... 
 (bringer of terrible misfortune) 

22
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,350
 is the most terrible misfortune among misfortunes. 

23
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,680
 You have only two choices. 

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,070
 The first is to live alone for the rest of your life,  isolating yourself from this mundane world. 

25
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,120
 Since your misfortune reaches no one, 

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,550
 it is the easiest way. 

27
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,850
 The other choice is you kill the person you love. 

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,170
Why? Has something happened?

29
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,800
No. Nothing has happened.

30
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,680
She was an ordinary woman.

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,810
What?

32
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,880
I told you she was a woman. Swindler Golsa's child.

33
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,390
I see.

34
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,760
Since you met the man called Baek Dae Gil, have you felt conflicted?

35
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,450
Indeed, you should.

36
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,710
May I tell you a funny story?

37
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,760
Baek Dae Gil was born under the Triple Kill fate,  which portends becoming a great leader.

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,310
Because you are also good at reading people's fates,

39
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,700
you can understand easily what I mean.

40
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,760
What happened?

41
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,290
Even though I tried to persuade her, I can't tell how she'll react.

42
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,360
A woman herself became Lee In Jwa's hostage for her father.

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,980
Since she is very filial, her mind—

44
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,690
No, I never planned at all on making Swindler Golsa act by using his daughter.

45
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll act as I intended without regard to her response.

46
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,680
Tomorrow, I'll go break Swindler Golsa.

47
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,470
It won't be easy because he has such powerful influence.

48
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,910
That's right. Do you think you can do it?

49
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,980
It won't be so hard if Your Highness helps me.

50
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,660
How can I?

51
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,640
You said you wanted to put your spoon and fork.

52
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,540
In order to abolish the law of  the market monopoly privileges, you must get the ledger from Swindler Golsa.

53
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,910
Why? Did you think you'd get it for free?

54
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,980
- But, what kind of help can I— 
 -By using the Office of the Inspector General,

55
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,750
take care of the people under Swindler Golsa's command.

56
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,420
So I can play a big round with Swindler Golsa.

57
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,280
That

58
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,770
will be difficult.

59
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,590
Right after the destruction of Ace of Sixes, I was removed from the court.

60
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,640
Not only was I removed from my position and rank,

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,970
my name  was even stricken from the list of government officials.

62
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,630
But it is not that we don't have a way.

63
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,610
Are you confident?

64
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,860
Don't be late tomorrow at Sinshi (3–5 pm)

65
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,050
Well, goodbye.

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm leaving now, too.

67
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,520
Dog Blade is waiting for me.

68
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,430
Will you come back?

69
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,270
Don't get hurt.

70
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,940
Tomorrow at Sinshi (3–5 pm)?

71
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,650
 Dog Blade 

72
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,370
I am thankful to you taking care of me in the meantime.

73
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,290
Are you leaving?

74
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,080
It's late night, so leave tomorrow.

75
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,060
 Please help me. If you help me, this life— 

76
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,200
 Your life! 

77
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,970
 Don't mention your life too easily. 

78
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,420
 It's not that cheap. 

79
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,280
Baek Dae Gil. Baek Dae Gil met her.

80
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,070
Ahh. Old Southern Goblin came to the gambling house today.

81
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,780
I thought he acted weirdly.

82
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,500
They were looking for Swindler Golsa's daughter.

83
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,700
So?

84
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,520
I didn't get involved in it at all because it might cause you trouble.

85
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,430
She is smart so that she won't act carelessly.

86
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,150
But Moo Myeong, you watch her closely.

87
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,380
Yes. My Liege.

88
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,970
By the way, what are you writing?

89
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,410
Today at Sinshi (3–5 pm), I'll come and take Swindler Golsa's neck. Therefore, wait for me.

90
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,220
—Baek Dae Gil.

91
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,480
After copying this, post it all over  Hanyang,

92
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,210
North Village, Marketplace, Street of Six Ministries, Jongno, and  Mapo as well.

93
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,290
 Today at Sinshi (3–5 pm), I'll come and take Swindler Golsa's neck. Therefore, wait for me. —Baek Dae Gil. 

94
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,740
What does this mean?

95
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,270
Is it saying he's going to take his neck?

96
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,770
He is a bad guy. 
 Choi Yee Seok  (Junior Deputy Left Minister)

97
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,550
If you mention Swindler Golsa, is he a gambler at Mapo?

98
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,020
He is not just a mere gambler.

99
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,380
He is the influential person who controls the movement of ships in and out.

100
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,940
And he acts as a middleman between the chartered merchants and Lee In Jwa.

101
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,590
If he falls, there'll be some damage to our Sorons as well. 
  (Jo Il Su, Junior Right Minister) 

102
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,250
Summon Lee In Jwa right now.

103
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,210
Here he comes.

104
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,670
Excellency.

105
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,500
 Kim Chang Jip,  Prime Minister 

106
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,080
Your Highness, did you know about this?

107
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,800
The deed this person called Baek Dae Gil has planned.

108
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,390
Regardless of what Baek Dae Gil does,

109
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,720
I'll catch Lee In Jwa.

110
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,010
Lee In Jwa?!

111
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,790
You don't mean the reason Your Highness raised the topic of abolishing the law of market monopoly privileges

112
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,060
is in fact to catch Lee In Jwa?

113
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,110
Yes.

114
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,510
To catch Lee In Jwa, we need to cut off his collusion with the chartered merchants.

115
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,850
That's why we need to catch the chartered merchants,

116
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,150
and we need the ledger that recorded all their evil deeds.

117
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,800
However, that ledger is in the hands of gambler Swindler Golsa.

118
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,350
By gaining possession of the ledger, and abolishing the merchant monopoly privilege,

119
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,890
you'd cut Lee In Jwa's purse strings.

120
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,740
Really. Just because you take down one gambler,

121
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,970
do you think that rotten fellow Lee In Jwa would even bat an eyelash?

122
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,220
No.  Swindler Golsa is not one to be taken lightly.

123
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,310
Isn't Mapo the most bustling area in Joseon?

124
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,800
 Make way for Merchant Elder. 

125
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,900
 The one who has an absolute fiscal monopoly on Mapo is Swindler Golsa. 

126
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,800
 No article may pass through Mapo Port without his permission. 

127
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,340
 Even the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Trading officials, who should manage and control it, 

128
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,330
 have a close  political and financial relationship with him. 

129
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,700
We cannot overlook this fact.  Speaking of which,

130
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,270
Your Excellency needs to help me.

131
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,950
I will influence the Capital Bureau for you.

132
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,000
( Capital Bureau: the regional administrators for the capital, Hanyang) 

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,460
However, I too have a condition that must be met.

134
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,950
In return for influencing the Capital Bureau,

135
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,850
hand over possession of the ledger to me,

136
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,730
and Your Highness should no longer pursue these matters.

137
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,950
I am telling you to delegate all the remaining affairs to me.

138
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,020
He seems to have a deep relationship with Prince Yeoning, too.

139
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,920
Who exactly is this Baek Dae Gil?

140
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,910
He is the pupil of the former training commander of the civilian militia, Kim Che Geon.

141
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,810
Do you remember the assassination incident created by the Current Crown two years ago?

142
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,910
That's the day that the Current Crown gave him the sword.

143
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,330
But... how is he able to grip the gambling houses as if they're in the palm of his hand?

144
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,210
And how did Prince Yeoning end up associating himself with a guy like him?

145
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,750
The story is quite long. Yet... don't worry too much.

146
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,760
All these

147
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,650
are happening in the palm of these hands.

148
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,400
 Today at Sinshi (3–5 pm), I'll come and take Swindler Golsa's neck. Therefore, wait for me. —Baek Dae Gil. 

149
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,080
 Royal Noble Consort Sook of the Haeju Choi clan 

150
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,820
It is Baek Dae Gil 
  King Sookjong 

151
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,020
It seems that those two fellows are baring their teeth

152
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,750
at Lee In Jwa.

153
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,900
Truly, it looks like a dangerous situation.

154
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,390
Right now,

155
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,730
I am asking if you'll be okay.

156
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,370
What are you talking about, Your Majesty?

157
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,010
The two fellows who might be brothers...

158
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,740
What're you going to do if this and that cause them to end up grinding their swords at each other?

159
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,600
Please resolve it.

160
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,870
If it doesn't get resolved, then cut out the situation.

161
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,250
Since you, Lady Sook Bin, are  the mother of those two,

162
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,950
and the start of it all.

163
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,850
Your Highness. Your Highness.

164
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,970
 Capital Bureau 

165
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,940
 Capital Bureau 

166
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,510
 I will influence the Capital Bureau for you. 

167
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,200
How many people in all are under the Capital Bureau?

168
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,370
 Port of Mapo 

169
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,770
What's&nbsp;the time now?

170
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,830
I have an important appointment today, so...

171
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,110
- Get him! 
 - Halt!

172
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,590
Arrest them all!

173
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,970
What is this matter at the Capital Bureau?

174
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,140
- Your Highness. 
 - As an official who receives a stipend by working for the public,

175
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,830
have you no shame?

176
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,320
Arrest them. Confiscate the maritime ledgers of the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Trading,

177
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,340
- and the transshipment ledgers! 
 - Yes, Sir.

178
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,050
 Since I have set the stage, the rest is up to you.  

179
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,650
 Today at Sinshi (3–5 pm), I'll come and take Swindler Golsa's neck. Therefore, wait for me. —Baek Dae Gil. 

180
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,360
It is Sinshi ( 3–5 pm )

181
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,050
You keep appointments on the dot.

182
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,040
It feels like I've become the King himself, seeing how you welcome me so.

183
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,840
It's nothing.

184
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,800
Hey, hey, why are you treating our guest like that?

185
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,350
Dominoes. Your specialty from the start, I see.

186
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,860
It's only just an appetizer.

187
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,810
And to find out a bit about your skill level...

188
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,250
- You're familiar with the rules right?
 - I do know them but...

189
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,890
I'm going easy on you because it's the first round.

190
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,230
The dominoes of this side are made from ox horns,

191
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,580
and the ones of that side are made from ivory.

192
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,430
They are double the price, and feel completely different too.

193
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,450
I see you've caught on.

194
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,890
This gambling house is fun.

195
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,130
Three are made from the paulownia tree, one from oak,

196
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,070
and

197
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,400
one made of mulberry that always gives a  yut. 

198
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,070
 In the game of yut, when all four sticks land with flat side up, that is "yut," which is worth four steps forward. 

199
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,890
A gambling card with a metal pin is invalid.

200
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,290
What is this?

201
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,450
This gambling house itself is just a game of deceit, isn't it?

202
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,550
What? Do you want me to reveal more?

203
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,580
Stop it.

204
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,380
I've seen enough of your skills already.

205
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,500
Do it for real.

206
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,970
You confirm.

207
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,700
Same weight and same texture.  Impossible to distinguish.

208
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,410
These are real.

209
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,390
So let's have a proper game.

210
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,010
So why did you put up the posters?

211
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,210
Though it's great, I became famous thanks to you.

212
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,250
It wasn't your work, trying to catch me?

213
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,800
Why would I?

214
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,010
You're trying to get out of it now?

215
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,470
So it wasn't you who put up the posters?

216
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,650
State the rules.

217
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,940
The double ten is the highest card.

218
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,220
And of course, no swindle.

219
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,950
Just that

220
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,080
there's one rule

221
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,240
that exists only in our Mapo gambling den.

222
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,310
Card stealing.

223
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,340
Card stealing?

224
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,220
Before you reveal your card,

225
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,920
you can switch your card with the opponent's card once.

226
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,940
The two can switch cards with each other?

227
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,850
Take two rounds out of three rounds and you're the winner.

228
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,050
The cards have been shuffled, so you go first.

229
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,980
I won't switch.

230
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,540
Then I...

231
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,090
Well, this is fishy.

232
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,280
Well, I'll go with my cards too then.

233
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,830
So should we reveal?

234
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,770
Double twos.

235
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,820
What are you doing? Go ahead.

236
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,730
Ten and three.

237
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,270
These are trash cards.  Three points.

238
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,800
 So you'll lose the first round to me? 

239
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,650
Two out of three means just one to go.

240
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,980
Don't be so sure.

241
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,290
You don't know about life until it's over.

242
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,460
In gambling, you don't know until all the cards have been turned.

243
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,450
The Ace of Sixes did that too, and was courted all the way to hell.

244
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,030
Now I'll shuffle.

245
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,280
 You're going to show it to me slowly?  Your skills. 

246
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,540
 Seven and two 

247
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,640
Let's switch them this time.

248
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:15,580
I think this little guy smells like a double.

249
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,840
You'll have to see before you know if it's double or poop.

250
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,000
Your turn.

251
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,480
None for me.  Let's turn them over.

252
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,070
Well, mine first.

253
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,820
 Two 

254
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,640
This time, the card I got from you.

255
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,620
 Two 

256
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,560
Double twos!

257
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,150
What are you doing? Go ahead and play.

258
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,500
 Seven 

259
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,060
 He's not wavering. 

260
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,680
 Three 

261
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,420
Mangtong (a combination that adds up to zero as last digit).

262
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,630
 Mine are seven and two. 

263
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,770
 Swindler Golsa's are two and three. 

264
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,540
 How did he do it? 

265
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,850
This is the last game.

266
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,340
Have you ever lost?

267
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,610
With these cards?

268
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,050
This skill has lasted me for 30 years.

269
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,830
Well, just once.

270
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,390
To Dog Blade.

271
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,750
Well,

272
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,330
today's your second time.

273
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,120
I'm glad I'm not late.

274
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,010
What's the White-Faced Scholar doing here again?

275
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,050
I was thinking of lending you some strength.

276
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,500
I brought a gift.

277
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,940
Yeon Hwa!

278
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,300
Father.

279
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,260
What the heck is this now?

280
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,500
We need something like this to rile up your real strength.

281
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,940
What's your reason?

282
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,910
Why did you put up posters everywhere in my name?

283
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,300
Thanks to the posters, you should have received a welcome.

284
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,030
So this match finally carries some weight.

285
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,560
Hurry and deal the cards then.

286
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,550
I...

287
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,290
will deal the cards.

288
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:16,260
Who is to know if Baek Dae Gil  will not pull a swindle?

289
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,860
What trick are you trying to play?

290
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,100
As filial piety

291
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,760
of course, you'd wish your father to win.

292
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,450
Go ahead then.

293
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,150
 Father. 

294
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,360
 Ten points. 

295
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,590
 Ten. 

296
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,290
 Five points. 

297
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,390
 Five 

298
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:33,400
 How did you know? It didn't seem like a swindle. 

299
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,600
 Sounds. 

300
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,770
 Those tags... have the different sounds. 

301
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,350
 Sounds? Is it a swindle? 

302
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,360
 Three points. 

303
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,870
 Two points. 

304
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,180
 Three points. 

305
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,160
 Double three. 

306
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,650
 Seven points. 

307
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,750
 Gabo. 
(a combination that adds up to 9 as the last digit) 

308
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,030
 Father has two threes in his hand. 

309
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,000
 Double three. 

310
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,220
 Baek Dae Gil has a seven and a two in his hand. 

311
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,550
 Gabo. 
(add up to nine points) 

312
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,450
 If they don't switch, Father will win. 

313
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,660
I don't want to switch.

314
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,290
If you want to switch, you may.

315
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,790
I will.

316
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,990
 Seven points... Father's tags are two threes. 

317
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,510
 If they switch tags, Baek Dae Gil will win. 

318
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,920
Thinking again, it's better not to switch.

319
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,820
 Father won. 

320
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,050
Why? Don't regret later.

321
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,140
It would be better to switch.

322
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,010
Anyhow, they say success is 70% luck and 30% effort. Let's just go ahead.

323
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,240
Well, show them.

324
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,780
A seven and a two make nine points. It's Gabo.

325
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,740
Well, for me,

326
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,470
Wait.

327
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,260
Is it right you play this round betting on this gambling house?

328
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,990
If I lose,

329
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,640
I'll give this gambling house to you.

330
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,090
If you lose,

331
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:03,020
the gambling houses you took away from the White-Faced Scholar will be all mine.

332
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:09,310
Why? Do you think it's a relief that you didn't bet your neck?

333
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,760
Instead of betting my neck,  granting the winner's wish. How about that?

334
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,600
If it's a wish we can grant...

335
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,630
Well, show them.

336
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,940
It's impossible.

337
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,700
It's not impossible. A sound swindle.

338
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,760
When was the swindle you are doing now popular?

339
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,270
I changed the tag's sound by scratching on it.

340
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,940
Even though you say so,

341
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,930
how did you do that in such a short time?

342
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,070
Do I get called a gambler by doing at least this much?

343
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,510
You Swindler Golsa.

344
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,150
You have to take responsibility for this. Huh?

345
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,070
No.

346
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,340
Your habit of stabbing someone in the back has not changed.

347
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,910
The point of your sword has gotten quite fierce.

348
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,210
Withdraw your swords.

349
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,710
We are not finished yet.

350
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,590
It's a note for 1000 nyangs.

351
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,220
Baek Dae Gil.

352
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,100
I am awarding this 1000 nyangs for his neck.

353
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,570
What are you doing, Lee In Jwa?

354
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,420
2000 nyangs!

355
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:11,020
This a huge sum of money you guys can't even touch for the rest of your life.

356
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,200
This isn't enough.

357
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,810
Then

358
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,680
I add 3000 nyangs more.

359
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,280
5000 nyangs!

360
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,630
5000 nyangs!

361
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,600
This amount of money will allow three generations  to live in an extravagant style.

362
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,350
What should we do?

363
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,570
Halt!

364
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,950
What is this?

365
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,540
Listen!
 Baek Joong Gi (Head of non-chartered merchants league) 

366
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,710
Baek Dae Gil is the man to whom we owe our lives.

367
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,710
He saved us from the Ace of Sixes. We owe him our lives!

368
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,480
What we need is not just a note for 5000 nyangs,

369
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,950
but a man like him who thinks about our lives. Don't you know that?

370
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,260
Stop!

371
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,840
Withdraw the tool weapons!

372
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,780
Is this Six Ministries Street?

373
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,620
To which gambling house did you dare to come

374
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,190
and play with money?

375
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,610
Then you want to finish the game, don't you?

376
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,250
Winning is  winning.

377
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,370
If you were a man,

378
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,010
you cleanly have to admit losing.

379
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:12,230
You dare to teach me, huh?

380
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:19,260
Go and bring the ledgers.

381
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,070
Father.

382
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,180
No matter how you look at, it seems there is nothing you can become involved in.

383
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,190
You probably didn't expect me to beat Swindler Golsa.

384
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,630
It's amazing.

385
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,430
Actually, rather than  the match between you and Swindler Golsa,

386
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,890
I came here with a different reason.

387
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,890
My heart flutters.

388
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,730
 Right, all those things you're seeing, hearing, and experiencing, 

389
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,460
 make them your own completely. 

390
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,410
Baek Dae Gil.

391
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,590
You'll be standing at the crossroads of choice soon.

392
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,240
Keep these words in mind.

393
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,290
In this world, there is no everlasting ally or foe.

394
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,680
As many allies as you have, you will have just as many foes.

395
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:59,500
Swindler Golsa,  you will pay dearly for your failure to safeguard this gambling den.

396
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,600
Let's go.

397
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,380
Is this the ledger?

398
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,580
Your Highness.  If this ledger becomes public,

399
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,250
be it Noron or Soron, they will all rise in protest.

400
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,710
Will you be able to afford it?

401
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:51,630
Would I have stood here without that much expectation?

402
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:02,320
Tidy up all the claims to Mapo commerce with the exception of this gambling den.

403
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,060
I'll be taking over tomorrow morning.

404
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,620
I understand.

405
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:12,200
Also, you agreed to fulfill a wish of mine.

406
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,190
Gramps!

407
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,210
Swindler Golsa.

408
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,520
Swindler Golsa.

409
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,810
Old Southern Goblin.

410
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:32,220
 Old man, you know what happens when you strike a swindle in this turf, right? 

411
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,150
 I'm pretty fond of your eyeball. 

412
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:05,740
Old man, it was a youthful arrogant mistake of mine.

413
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,730
Please forgive me.

414
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:15,470
If the body is 1,000 nyangs, then the eye is 900 nyangs.

415
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,960
To think of the years I have been living with only 450 nyangs' worth of a single eye.

416
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,680
I'd pull your limbs apart.

417
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,950
But what can I do?

418
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,990
That's enough, so get up.

419
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:47,900
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

420
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:11,310
I'm Baek Joong Gi, who is spearheading the non-chartered merchants of Hanyang.

421
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,330
I'm Moon Jeong Min, the chief of Mapo tradesmen.

422
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,340
I'm Lee Eun Chang of the Cheon Ahn tradesmen.

423
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,710
I'm Sin Yong Gol, chief of Ahn Hyang tradesmen.

424
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,760
Kim Gil Jil of Mopo tradesmen.

425
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,140
Seo Yang Woon of Busan tradesmen.

426
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,760
Yoon Gak, chief of Eun Joo tradesmen.

427
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,260
You've become a hero.

428
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,020
You don't need to thank me.

429
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,230
Thank you.

430
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,440
Well, let's part ways here.

431
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,490
Baek Dae Gil, hooray!

432
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,920
Baek Dae Gil!

433
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,220
Hooray for Lord Baek Dae Gil!

434
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,200
Father, I can't accept this.

435
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,060
To give away the gambling den to him?  But you worked so hard.

436
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,630
It's not like you made it.

437
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:40,460
Don't hold any lingering feelings about it, just think about getting married, Yeon Hwa.

438
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,870
I'm not getting married or anything.

439
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,160
How about him?

440
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,470
That Baek Dae Gil.

441
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,650
Father!

442
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:56,890
But he saved you!  I see from your expression you don't dislike him.

443
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,860
Father!

444
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:09,050
That man Baek Dae Gil cracked Seoso Gate and even took over Swindler Golsa's Mapo.

445
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,600
Furthermore, Prince Yeoning has the ledgers to put an end to us.

446
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,390
How in the world did this happen?

447
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,630
Did you not clearly say to wait and see?

448
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:23,870
It's tomorrow.  If for any reason, the ledgers

449
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,590
that reveal the back deals we made with the chartered merchants,

450
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,650
end up in His Majesty's hands...

451
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,480
We must settle on our countermeasure at once.

452
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,500
It's the ledger with records of those who committed bribery and the amounts.

453
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,980
And this ledger

454
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,050
lists those who received the bribes, the dates and times,

455
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,300
and the names of the witnesses, all recorded in detail.

456
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:06,960
Fortunately, your name was not found anywhere.

457
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,430
Then as promised, please remove your hands from it, Your Highness.

458
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:17,330
The rest, I will see to their settlement.

459
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,540
Here, you are really quite something to be proud of.

460
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,500
All thanks

461
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,790
to how I raised him.

462
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,720
Born as a man for the Eight Provinces of Joseon,

463
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,180
you've let your name be known, and what a great feat that is.

464
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,620
Here, this is on me, so order to your heart's content.

465
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,170
Gramps, your money is my money though.

466
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,290
The beholder of the money is the owner.

467
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,090
I'll go get more wine.

468
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,280
Our Dae Gil is indeed so dashing.

469
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,040
Baek Dae Gil.

470
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:40,180
When tomorrow morning comes, the world will be upside down,

471
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,210
by your name.

472
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:01,480
How is it that you don't even get drunk by wine?

473
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,820
So you're curious about that too, Your Highness?

474
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,320
Your Highness?

475
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,150
The high ministers of the royal court are always calling me "Your Highness" this and "Your Highness" that, and it's a pain.

476
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:20,760
But how can "Your Highness" sound so great?

477
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,470
Here, have a cup.

478
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,060
Your Highness.

479
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,330
So you and that Baek Dae Gil.

480
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:48,470
Why do you continue to be close to him?

481
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:57,830
Do you deem him to be a friend or such in your status?

482
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,860
Discarding

483
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:16,160
status. Discarding power, and discarding customs,

484
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,320
at last my eyes were truly opened.

485
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:28,960
And finally I saw a friend I could not see before.

486
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:34,840
The pain of the people that I knew but ignored.

487
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,140
I was finally able to see it.

488
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:48,480
You see a friend and you see the people, so it's all great.

489
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,700
For that friend of yours...

490
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,040
can you give up your life for him?

491
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,200
For the people of this land...

492
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,820
can you give up this throne?

493
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,480
Keep this in mind.

494
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,740
If you can't do any of these things, that person is not your friend,

495
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,860
nor are the people of this land yours.

496
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:42,860
So I'm telling you to act appropriately for your status.

497
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,620
Understood?

498
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,620
Hey Dae Gil. What's your dream?

499
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,240
My dream? Let's see...

500
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,720
I don't know what my dream is,

501
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,380
but I do want to become a dream for someone else.

502
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,220
Then...

503
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,440
Can you become my dream?

504
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,920
♬  I want to love you   ♬

505
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,440
Seol Im... You don't have any dreams?

506
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,820
♬  My one and only love   ♬

507
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,740
I...

508
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,060
Instead of some distant dreams that my hands can't even reach.

509
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,800
♬  Deep within my heart   ♬

510
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,720
I want my dream of being by your side to become a reality.

511
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,280
♬  I close my eyes and imagine you  ♬

512
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,540
♬  And it feels as if I can hold onto you   ♬

513
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,160
I'll go to bed now.

514
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,180
O-Okay...

515
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,940
♬  My broken self from your tears  ♬

516
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,820
Thanks.

517
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,680
For what?

518
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,260
Just... for everything.

519
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,220
Hurry and go to bed.

520
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,860
♬   For as long as I breathe and my heart beats  ♬

521
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:32,940
♬  My heart will always be at your side  ♬

522
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:38,500
♬  Please don't ever forget that  ♬

523
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,940
Who is it?

524
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,260
You're stronger than I expected.

525
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,420
The Ace of Sixes, and even Swindler Golsa...

526
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,440
Dog Blade...

527
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,420
Shall we see your skills?

528
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,530
So you're not just all fluff.

529
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:25,700
Why? It seems you were scared to come here alone.

530
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:45,040
Seol Im... What are you going to do with her?

531
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,600
She says she's going to leave your grasp.

532
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,020
She's going to leave, huh?

533
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,460
I have a favor. Don't die in a dangerous place.

534
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,300
You embarrassed me.

535
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,000
Forgive me.

536
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,800
Be careful next time.

537
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,800
What are you doing? If you came, then you should come in.

538
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,700
Hey Dae Gil.

539
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,620
Take care of yourself, okay?

540
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,180
Okay.

541
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,040
 You only have two choices. 

542
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,200
 The first is to live alone, isolating yourself from this mundane world. 

543
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,120
 I was born with a terrible misfortune, you see. 

544
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:38,180
 I'll be leaving far away. A place without you, Dae Gil, and everyone else. 

545
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,320
Why this punk... Where did he go?

546
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,600
Dae Gil!

547
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,920
Oh my! Our Seol Im!

548
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,420
Seol Im!

549
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,380
Seol Im's straw shoe.

550
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,180
Don't delude yourself to think you could take my father's place just because you're seated in the boss's chair.

551
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,520
I will not acknowledge you. Never.

552
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,120
I can't fill your father's seat, but I will see to it that Boss Golsa's request is carried out.

553
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,800
Request?

554
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,020
Stop!

555
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,300
What are you doing?

 Swindler Golsa.  Did you kill him?  

562
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,160
 If I tell you, do you have any intention of believing me? 

563
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,300
 Have you seen Seol Im? 

564
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:51,980
 Seol Im? 

565
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,720
 Don't turn your back on me. 

566
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,640
 Arrest Baek Dae Gil.  Even without this sword, 

567
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,120
 I also believe you. 

568
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,060
 You incinerated the evidence that was so hard to get? 

569
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,940
 Did you not promise me you'd leave it to me? 

570
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,500
 Now it's time for everyone to be erected. 

571
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,180
 No matter how, I will... 

572
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,780
 end his life. 

573
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,240
 Baek Dae Gil, are you truly my older brother?  

574
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,660
 I will arrest the true culprit before the bell rings. 

575
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,740
 Now I know who the culprit is.
