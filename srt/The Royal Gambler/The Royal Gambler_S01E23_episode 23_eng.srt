00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,300
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

3
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,020
Baek Dae Gil.

4
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,660
Long time no see. Yi In Jwa.

5
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,680
Is it your doing?

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,770
Enough. Give up now.

7
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,570
Here. Hurry up.

8
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,940
You lost most of the supplies and food for the soldiers.

9
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,110
Half of your soldiers are held back with upset stomachs.

10
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,850
It's almost impossible for you and your soldiers to advance.

11
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,430
No, it's too early to give up. 
 ( Yi In Jwa )

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,000
 Prince Milpung 
 (Yi Tan, Crown Prince Sohyeon's great-grandson) 

13
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,310
This is His Highness, Prince Milpung.

14
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,770
Are you Baek Dae Gil?

15
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,510
The royal court will commit all military forces to block the treason.

16
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,610
They say the army general will really lead 50,000 soldiers, right?

17
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,850
The central soldiers from the five military departments will join forces

18
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,130
and gather at Anseong. Isn't that right?

19
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,380
You must be feeling anxiously urgent, because you even planted a spy.

20
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,850
The justification of the Great Cause is still thriving,

21
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,600
and there are still more than 10,000 soldiers left.

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,370
Also, 100,000 rising solders from Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province will join us.

23
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,400
So block us to the death.

24
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,020
I'll look forward to it.

25
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,400
Please give up.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,630
Are you going to send all these people to their deaths?

27
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:47,100
They are the comrades of the Great Cause who stood up on their own and volunteered for service.

28
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,310
How dare such a bastard like you—

29
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,330
Soon, all of them will come to know

30
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,790
your true colors, Yi In Jwa, who would exhaust every means to sit on the throne,

31
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,850
and who would sacrifice the people for his ambition.

32
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,880
I'll block you.

33
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,100
Without fail, I'll send you to join your ancestors.

34
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,540
 Leaving the wounded, women, and children here, we are advancing. 

35
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,220
 Instead of horses, let the strong men pull the wagons. 

36
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,590
 Keep sending the pigeon posts to ascertain the situation and movements in Gyeongsang  and Jeolla Province. 

37
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,140
Dae Gil, I was really worried.

38
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,200
Let's organize quickly.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,750
Well... Since others' eyes are watching me...

40
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,350
I'm thinking of carrying a sword...

41
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,460
Gramps, don't think useless thoughts, help over there.

42
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,020
Is it enough for you alone to wear a sword?

43
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,180
Well! Let's gather here.

44
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,920
I'll give you food now.

45
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,200
All of you! Grab it and go home!

46
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,290
Don't uselessly break your leg or bleed.

47
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,240
Hurry to come here. You people who sink down on the ground, get up quickly and come here!

48
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,760
All of you! Let's gather here! Come here!

49
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,700
Boil down these medicinal herbs and take them.

50
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,120
Hurry and take it before you become dehydrated.

51
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,460
Come here!

52
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,310
Here, some.

53
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,130
Boil them down well and take them.

54
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,080
Here.

55
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,170
Are you going to give some to your wife too?

56
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,210
Was your part cut off?

57
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,550
Where did you come from?

58
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,560
Dae Gil!

59
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,090
The stomach upsets have subsided.

60
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,830
Even though we gave out a lot of food,

61
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,520
we still have a lot of food left.

62
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,430
It's a relief.

63
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,630
Go outside. Everybody is waiting for you.

64
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,330
What will happen to us now? We joined in the treason.

65
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,710
I heard the people who joined in the treason will be beheaded.

66
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,920
Since all of you dropped your spears and swords like this, that won't happen at all.

67
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,460
Is it true?

68
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,580
The King promised

69
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,300
to forgive whoever drops their weapons at any time.

70
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,210
He said it clearly.

71
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,650
Therefore, everybody, all of you have to do is to take the food

72
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,140
and go to your hometowns.

73
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,530
Is it true? Did the King really say that?

74
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,910
The Army General, his 50,000 soldiers and 5,000 central solders joined together,

75
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,280
and passed the Gwacheon area just now.

76
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,750
However, to block Jeong Hee Ryang,  Park Pil Hyeon,  and their 100,000 rebel soldiers,

77
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,430
our numbers are far from sufficient, aren't they?

78
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,680
If we are not able to block Anseong,

79
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,560
it's a matter of time before the capital falls.

80
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,850
Your Majesty!

81
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,980
It's a message from Mokcheon.

82
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,160
Baek Dae Gil broke down half of the rebel army.

83
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:31,850
Of 30,000 Yi In Jwa's soldiers, he reorganized barely half of them and advanced to Anseong.

84
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,580
Although his army has been cut in half,

85
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,630
if we miss the chance, in the end we will cede Anseong.

86
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,920
Since the central army also arrives in two days,

87
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,340
we can't waste a moment.

88
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,700
I'll go myself.

89
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,010
But, Your Majesty. If you go there yourself, it's too dangerous—

90
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,240
When the bastards are close at hand,

91
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,020
do you mean that after everything, I should just watch and give them the palace in the end?

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,450
Each moment is urgent, so everybody hurry to get ready.

93
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,070
Yes. Your Majesty.

94
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,900
We need to send a message to Dae Gil.

95
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,840
You don't need to.

96
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,230
What do you mean we don't need to?

97
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,780
Regardless the movements in the capital,

98
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,280
Dae Gil will move as planned.

99
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,970
Planned?

100
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,840
Right now, the rebel army is  probably passing here.

101
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,110
But the rebel solders who didn't eat  are getting tired.

102
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,190
So they will stop by this town before going to Anseong.

103
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,770
My Liege, the soldiers are getting very tired.

104
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,440
It's hard to advance the date by two days for a four-day march.
 (Hwang Jin Gi) 

105
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,760
Without food and horses,

106
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,110
if we force ourselves to keep going like this,  all of us will collapse before we reach Anseong.

107
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,720
Let's unpack at the nearby town.

108
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,810
 It is possible that they might pillage this village. 

109
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,010
The rest of you should take the remaining provisions and head to this village.

110
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,830
It's a letter sent by your master.

111
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,320
 I found Jeong Hee Ryang's station. 

112
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,140
 I will keep my promise to you. 

113
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,470
 I will make sure that no one gets hurt.  
 ( Kim Che Geon )

114
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,130
In terms of the South, there's nothing we can do but trust in Master.

115
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,840
- Then, now what? 
 - We have to move on to the next part of the plan.

116
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,150
Three-step strategy?

117
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,320
First, smuggling the military horses and provisions,

118
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,670
to slow down the attack of the rebel forces.

119
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,810
Eh, do you think that's an easy matter?

120
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,250
There rebel forces have a weakness.

121
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,680
Coming across the eight provinces, they haven't been together long, so they do not know each other's faces.

122
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,430
I just received notice. It seems they were successful.

123
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,410
Are you serious?

124
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,340
Let's have just a bit more strength.

125
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,440
We are almost there.

126
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,870
 It seems around half the soldiers have fallen away. 

127
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,670
Then what's the second part of the plan?

128
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,970
It's trampling on the boosted confidence the rebel forces acquired after winning  Cheongju City.

129
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,690
"Yi In Jwa's rebellion has failed."

130
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,080
We will spread this rumor.

131
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,650
Wow, that's spectacularly good.

132
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
Since the truth of rumors cannot be verified,

133
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,440
those who sought to join the rebel forces,

134
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,970
can't help but be very careful.

135
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,710
How is it that there are no soldiers in sight?

136
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,330
Hmmm.

137
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,550
A rumor is circulating at the marketplace

138
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,600
that Great Commander Yi In Jwa  has been defeated at Anseong.

139
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,720
How could you be so dense? 
 ( Park Pil Hyeon )

140
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,140
You wouldn't...

141
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,480
believe that baseless rumor?

142
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,460
It's unbelievable, but I can't dismiss it either.

143
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,390
I am sorry that I cannot be of help to you.

144
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,300
How about we say that our promise never—

145
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,480
What are you doing?

146
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,020
If you decide to withdraw from the situation in this manner, it looks like you'll betray me,

147
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,720
so I can't send you away.

148
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,820
You bastard—

149
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,420
Is a traitor in the end a traitor?

150
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,310
Arrest these bastards this instant!

151
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,270
Yes!

152
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,580
Stop them!

153
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,900
Did you have them concealed?

154
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,960
On general principle, I tend not to trust those

155
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,550
who receive their pay from the government.

156
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,170
Let's observe for a bit longer.

157
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,600
Dae Gil.

158
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,460
It appears the forces of five military departments have left the palace.

159
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,930
 I'll give you five days. 

160
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,550
 If there is no news even after five days have passed, 

161
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,630
 the central army will be mobilized. 

162
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,520
Grandfather, the situation has become urgent.

163
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,900
I'll move first, so you take care of the remaining people.

164
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,660
Where are you going alone?

165
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,660
To Anseong. Before something happens,

166
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,240
I must meet the King.

167
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,680
My Liege, we've already gone half a day without food.

168
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,430
At this rate, we'll—

169
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,320
Everyone gather up the last bit of your strength.

170
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,060
According to our news from the Yeongnam (current Gyeongsang Province) and Honam (current Jeolla Province) regions,

171
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,780
two days from now. In two days' time,

172
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,700
the 100,000 troops who are marching for us will join us at Anseong.

173
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,620
We will complete the Cause we have been working for.

174
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,490
I'm feeling hungry

175
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,840
and I don't have any strength.

176
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,160
Look, My Liege.

177
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,860
Two days? I don't think we'll last more than half a day.

178
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,260
Look! Isn't that something edible?

179
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,520
What is that?

180
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,930
 Let go. 

181
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,450
Let's share it.

182
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,190
Oh, radish stems? Give it here. Oh my, oh my. None of us have been able to eat.

183
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,700
Give it here. Give it up!

184
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,390
It's mine! Let go!

185
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,690
Pick 20 good soldiers.

186
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,990
What are you guys doing? Why aren't you hurrying?

187
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,660
My Liege.

188
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,130
Don't you think it's wrong of us to pillage the people's provisions?

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,800
It is only the bare minimum that is needed on our march to Anseong.

190
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,330
Are you suggesting we give up the Great Cause over a few sacks of rice?

191
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,720
Have them moved.

192
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,900
Look here.

193
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
Who did it?

194
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,050
You bastards! You can't!

195
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,090
Do you know what this rice means to us?

196
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,080
Aigoo, aigoo, Elder, are you okay?

197
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,700
Elder...

198
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,310
You bastards, deserving of death!

199
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,720
You have nothing to take so you take from lowborn tenant farmers?

200
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,330
This a**. Hey, you piece of—

201
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,880
If you're going to take the provisions here, take our heads first!

202
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,770
I'm telling you, kill us first then take it!

203
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,450
Because even if we must die, we will never give it up! Try to have it your way then!

204
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,590
That's right!

205
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,990
Then, I have no other choice.

206
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,930
You lock them up inside there,

207
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,030
and the others move the rice.

208
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,150
What are you doing now?!

209
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,740
From now on, whoever blocks or prevents me from getting to Anseong,

210
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,050
I will mercilessly cut their hand off.

211
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,330
What... What did you say?!

212
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,730
Whoever that may be.

213
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,760
What?! Then are you saying you want a go?!

214
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,060
Are you saying you want to fight?

215
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,830
What is your reason for imprisoning all these people!?

216
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,190
It is a sacrifice for the Great Cause. Just know it as that.

217
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,220
Are you crazy?!

218
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,970
I will surely make a prosperous country and raise a strong army

219
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,660
that will befit their holy sacrifice.

220
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,870
Watching innocent people die, I can't do that!

221
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,780
Are you planning on ruining the Great Cause?

222
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,870
Do you really not know it is all sacrifice required for salvation?

223
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,100
 Jukju Mountain Fortress 

224
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,640
How many soldiers have gathered in all?

225
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,660
Though they number 35,000 as of now,

226
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,850
20,000 more from Suwon and Yongin will soon join us.

227
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,380
Approximately where are the rebel forces?

228
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,560
They have not yet reached Anseong.

229
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,520
According to the recon troops, a fellow by the name of Baek Dae Gil

230
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,520
has stolen Yi In Jwa's war horses and provisions.

231
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,080
We hear that rumors are circulating in Jeolla Province that Yi In Jwa failed to incite the soldiers.

232
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,370
It must be the doing of this fellow called, Baek Dae Gil.

233
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,690
 Is there a reason that you are so confident that you will block Yi In Jwa? 

234
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,100
 I am asking if you have a plan. 

235
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,800
 Going after his weaknesses, I will slow down his march 

236
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,710
 and cut his numbers in half. 

237
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,650
Second,

238
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,230
what is scarier than a sword is

239
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,260
a rumor.

240
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,850
Rumor?

241
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,630
Using rumors, we will cut off Yi In Jwa's arms and legs.

243
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,880
 Then what's the plan after that? 

244
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,910
 The third plan is... 

245
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,850
There will be 100,000 rebel solders coming up from Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province.

246
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,250
If we fail, we are done for.

247
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,470
- Aigoo.  
 - Have some strength.

248
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,000
  Hwang Jin Gi 

249
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,290
You all must be exhausted,

250
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,360
but just have a bit more strength. 
 ( Yi In Jwa )

251
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,060
They look terrible.

252
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,140
How about 
  (Prince Milpung, Yi Tan, Crown Prince Sohyeon's great-grandson) 

253
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,860
quitting around this time?

254
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,710
Why are you saying such weak words?

255
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,130
Commander-in-Chief,

256
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,600
This is not the kind of world that I imagined.

257
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,120
I heard you looted.

258
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,780
It was a choice that could not be avoided.

259
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,890
That choice...

260
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,580
Do you think that it was right?

261
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,450
Follow me.

262
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,650
Nobody touched the food.

263
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,950
They are commoners before they are soldiers.

264
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,220
To make the country prosperous and create a country for the people,

265
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,850
they threw themselves into this matter with enthusiasm.

266
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,620
How could they eat this looted food?

267
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,820
It's not looted, it's sacrificed.

268
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,160
If the people are sacrificed for me to sit on the throne,

269
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,840
what meaning would it have?

270
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
Anseong is just in front of us, Your Highness.

271
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,790
In half a day, the throne will fall into your hands.

272
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,920
Saying those things, you hurriedly ushered all those commoners here, didn't you?

273
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,600
In the end, didn't you plunder a village and even kill people, too?

274
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,490
Why did you do that?

275
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,410
If I happen to starve, I'll starve.

276
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,680
But did we say we should take it away from innocent people?

277
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,290
I told you repeatedly not to talk glibly.

278
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,630
I

279
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,490
followed His Highness Prince Milpung,

280
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,800
not you, Sir.

281
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,460
What?

282
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,840
If you value your own life,

283
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,930
be careful with what you say!

284
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,870
You... You! How could you, without even batting an eye, dare to kill—

285
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,840
Your Highness,

286
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,660
I beg of you to please believe in me, Yi In Jwa.

287
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,400
This lowly subject will deliver the throne, Your Highness, without fail,

288
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
into your hands.

289
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,840
You did not need to KILL!

290
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,970
Bury them in a sunny place.

291
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,310
I want to be alone.

292
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,780
I am sorry.

293
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,650
Your Majesty, why didn't you keep your promise?

294
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,540
Didn't you say you would give your lowly servant five days' time?

295
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,800
Today would be the fifth day.

296
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,390
As for you,

297
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,050
have you brought Yi In Jwa's head to me?

298
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,360
Of course your achievement is great.

299
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,050
You cut the number of the rebel forces in half,

300
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,560
and smuggled the war horses and provisions, slowing down the march.

301
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,800
However,

302
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,820
your role will only go that far.

303
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,890
From now on,

304
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,940
I will suppress the rebellion myself.

305
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,460
Are you planning on drawing your sword against the people?

306
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,780
These are your subjects, Your Majesty. They are your children!

307
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,050
Since they have given up on being my subjects,

308
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,920
I will punish their wrongdoings with the sword.

309
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,820
Your Majesty, how do you think that I, without even once using the sword,

310
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,650
was able to cut Yi In Jwa's supporters in half?

311
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,640
It's faith.

312
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,620
 Here, take one. 

313
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,360
 It is having faith in the common people. 

314
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,290
 Thank you very much. 

315
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,790
 Take it and live well! 

316
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,960
They number as many as 15,000.

317
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,130
That many soldiers have thrown away their swords.

318
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,670
What do you think that signifies?

319
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,350
I can do it.

320
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,660
Without raising a sword or shedding blood,

321
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,720
we can stifle this uprising.

322
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,780
Soon that bastard will arrive here.

323
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,120
If this place falls, then they can reach the Four Gates of the Capital without shedding any blood.

324
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,960
No matter how many government troops there may be,

325
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,170
it will be hard to block them. So I

326
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,620
definitely plan on beating an iron bludgeon right into this place,

327
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,170
on the rebellion,

328
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,050
to put it into complete disarray.

329
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,780
Your Majesty!

330
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,410
The rebel forces have arrived.

331
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,540
In the end, you came here.

332
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,440
To Anseong.

333
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,420
Is there no news from Yeongnam and Honam regions?

334
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,130
As for Yeongnam, they have just taken off from Jincheon.

335
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,610
We received notice that Honam just passed Pyeongtaek.

336
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,020
A quarter of a day must pass for them to arrive.

337
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,240
If the government troops should attack in the meantime,

338
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,580
it will be over.

339
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,880
Don't worry.

340
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,660
Inside there,

341
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,730
I have hidden a card.

342
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,290
Look.

343
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,400
Those soldiers...

344
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,600
Do they look like my subjects to you?

345
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,660
Slaughter the rebel forces.

346
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,460
Your Majesty.

347
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,720
Yi In Jwa, Prince Milpung, and all others who have taken part in the act of treason

348
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,550
Do not leave a single one out—!

349
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,850
Step aside!

350
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,080
No, Your Majesty, you mustn't!

351
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,960
Do you dare? Go against me?

352
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,470
They are your subjects.

353
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,730
They are the enemy.

354
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,190
Please bestow your mercy upon them.

355
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,660
They are people who do not know about kindness,

356
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,570
so I will pass judgment through the sword.

357
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,060
As for me.

358
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,950
Will you throw me away too?

359
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,250
If you are going to ally with the enemy,

360
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,480
I will gladly cut your neck.

361
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,740
Your Majesty.

362
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,340
I have promised His Majesty, the former King, that I will surely protect Your Majesty.

363
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,080
However, that oath! From this moment forward,

364
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,680
I cannot keep it.

365
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,810
What are you doing?

366
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,100
You, bastard, really!

367
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,250
King!

368
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,880
Now, die!

369
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,460
What did you say? Still left there?

370
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:01,200
Since the royal court has become rotten as possible, wouldn't it be even stranger if no one left there?

371
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,740
Right after the Dowager Queen joined me,

372
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,210
the commanders from Su Eo Defense Department and Fireworks Military Department turned their backs on the King.

373
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,390
Since the foolish King came this far,

374
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,280
after all, it looks like he is rushing to end his life soon.

375
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,780
Finally, the King is dead!

376
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:59,440
Soon, the fortress gate will open! Our great dream we have held will come true!

377
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,690
Now, we  are going to advance on the capital this way!

378
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,230
- Everybody! Are you ready?  
  - Yes!

379
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,630
Your Highness! You go in first.

380
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,770
Advance!

381
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,820
Baek Dae Gil.

382
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,930
Retreat!

383
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,950
Retreat!

384
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,950
You! From now on, you are not the insurgents any more.

385
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:49,570
That fellow Yi In Jwa doesn't have the Great Cause!

386
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:54,210
He only has his ugly self-interest.

387
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,900
Your Highness. We're waiting for you.

388
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,800
 Were you looking for me? 

389
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,520
 I asked what your last, third strategy is. 

390
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,600
 If the rebel army from Honam region and Yeongnam region are Yi In Jwa's two arms, 

391
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,400
 the sword in Yi In Jwa's hand is Prince Milpung. 

392
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,530
 The dagger that he holds to his chest is the spies that hide in the palace. 

393
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,700
 Prince Milpung and the remnants from the military officials faction... 

394
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,550
 How do you plan to cut off those two? 

395
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:56,780
 I'll let the rebel army led by Prince Milpung march in here. 

396
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,730
 You're going to set a trap by using Prince Milpung as a bait? 

397
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,670
  How can you reveal the remnants from the military officials faction? 

398
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:14,350
 I... will... point the knife at Your Majesty's neck. 

399
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,490
 I never thought it possible! 

400
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,510
 As many as two of them! 

401
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,270
 I can't believe this even with my two eyes! 

402
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,300
Throw away your weapons!

403
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:20,330
His Majesty promised to let all of those who surrender live!

404
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,940
Before my mind changes, lay down your swords!

405
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,070
Don't be afraid!

406
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:57,140
Soon the rebellion will be over and all of you will be able to go back to your hometowns.

407
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,760
You saved 7,000 people again.

408
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,640
However, your role only goes this far.

409
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,640
I'll punish the rest.

410
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,320
Your Majesty.

411
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:26,200
Prince Milpung, I'll punish you after suppressing the rebellion.

412
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,040
Your Majesty!

413
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,580
Your Majesty, please put your sword down.

414
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,770
Soon, 100,000 insurgents will gather here.

415
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:51,340
If we miss this chance, from here to the capital it's an ownerless (deserted) mountain, so we'll be finished.

416
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:59,150
If we don't attack first, the capital, following Anseong, will fall as well.

417
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll make sure to succeed with the second strategy.

418
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,400
Did you receive a message?

419
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,800
Did you confirm that they blocked Park Pil Hyeon and killed Jeong Hee Ryang?

420
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,710
Tonight is the last night.

421
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,090
We set up a rough camp.

422
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:47,770
Prince Milpung rejected the throne so simply offered to him.

423
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,410
My Liege, it's hard this way.

424
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,360
Already not enough when the number was cut in half, our number has been cut in half again.

425
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,220
Gather the leader-level soldiers.

426
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,020
I have something to say.

427
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,340
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

428
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,330
What can you gain without any sacrifice?

429
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,170
How can you force the people to sacrifice themselves?

430
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,120
After subduing the rebellion, I'll ask for forgiveness.

431
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,220
I will arrange their funerals and continue to care for them generation upon generation.

432
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,870
Did you say I'm forcing their sacrifice?

433
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
I also

434
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,200
have made up my mind to suffer the disgrace of being called a tyrant.

435
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,480
Your Majesty!

436
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,430
- Why are they doing this to us? 
  - We just stand here for a moment?

437
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,400
- Here! 
  - Do we all stand here?

438
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,750
- What do we do with this? 
  - Do we stand here?

439
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,060
Do you mean they all die?

440
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,560
We still have more than 8,000 soldiers.

441
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:16,250
If we resist and endure, Park Pil Hyeon and Jeong Hee Ryang's big army will join us.

442
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,570
The Central Army is five times bigger than ours.

443
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,620
Are you saying that because you don't know?

444
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,620
My Liege, this is not it. I'm telling you it's not.

445
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,010
This far!

446
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,960
Do you know how we came this far?

447
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,400
The victory is in front of our noses.

448
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,270
Did you forget the thousands or tens of thousand of comrades who were sacrificed?

449
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,910
Tonight,

450
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,920
there will be a surprise attack.

451
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,550
Tonight,

452
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,010
I'll conduct a surprise attack myself.

453
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,020
The royal troops attacked us.

454
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,640
Finally...

455
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,610
Are you ready?

456
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

457
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,350
Attack!

458
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,690
Please halt!

459
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,760
Your Majesty, please halt!

460
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,600
It's already too late.

461
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,530
Those standing over there are only a shield.

462
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,460
They are traitors here with traitorous minds.

463
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,340
Wipe them out, to the last man!

464
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,800
Fire!

465
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,460
Aigoo! My son!

466
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,750
Wake up! Open your eyes!

467
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,520
Come to your senses!

468
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,800
Stop!

469
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,920
Please stop!

470
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,870
Look at it clearly with those eyes.

471
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:30,550
Is this really... Is this truly the Great Cause you wanted?

472
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,640
Where is the Great Cause without a sacrifice?

473
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,260
Regroup

474
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,860
and block the royal army!

475
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,180
Aim!

476
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,180
Your Majesty!

477
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:20,230
Halt! Halt! Halt!

478
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,910
Don't shoot! Don't do this!

479
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,410
Please save them!

480
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,760
Cease fire!

481
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,510
Seol Im!

482
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,240
Your Majesty, please trust me.

483
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,060
 Though your intention is admirable, 

484
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:08,300
 I don't intend to watch the insurgents who joined the rebels at all. 

485
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,360
 Then I'll show you 

486
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,390
 whether they are traitors or innocent people. 

487
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,420
 What? 

488
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,220
 Please watch them. 

489
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,770
This humble subject will show you.

490
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,860
Whole army!

491
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,830
Halt the attack!

492
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:38,490
Baek Dae Gil, it's still not over.

493
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:40,470
You are finished now.

494
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:46,370
However... you still choose.

495
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,090
The people's lives

496
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,190
all depend on your choice.

497
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:05,080
If I held my life dear, I wouldn't have even started.

498
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:12,500
I, Yi In Jwa, with those around me, will bury my bones in this place.

499
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,670
I will... ally myself with you.

500
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,340
Having come now, you will ally with me,

501
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,720
you Baek Dae Gil, will do so?

502
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,890
All the commoners who followed you have fallen away,

503
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,930
and even Prince Milpung has turned his back on you.

504
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,990
Now you don't even have a reason to take over the throne.

505
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,920
So?

506
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,210
I will pledge against my own life

507
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,200
that if you prove that you're right, I'll do it.

508
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:58,050
Proof? How do we go about proving it?

509
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,420
Leave it to the heavens.

510
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,050
What did you say?

511
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:10,490
Your Majesty. It's not a situation where we can just wait and see.

512
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,420
Your Majesty.

513
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,420
Wait.

514
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:32,240
Do you remember? This coin?

515
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,610
 For this mere coin, I wagered my life 

516
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,430
 and I was able to protect it too. 

517
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:51,240
This brass coin changed my life.

518
00:52:52,160 --> 00:53:01,550
So I'm saying your fate and mine—this country Joseon's fate—I'll wager on this round.

519
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,100
Sure.

520
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,220
I will.

521
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,770
Let's make this one thing clear.

522
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:19,660
Promise in front of all the people standing here

523
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,750
that if I win,

524
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,760
you'll cleanly give up.

525
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,600
If by chance you win,

526
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,630
I'll give up the Great Cause.

527
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,600
Choose.

528
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:10,070
I choose heads.

529
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,610
Then I'll choose tails.

530
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,810
I'm curious.

531
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:25,050
Whether heaven will select you or me, Yi In Jwa.

532
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:31,440
You know what? If it's not certain I don't place a bet.

533
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:56,140
As you promised, give up everything and docilely accept being tied up.

534
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,690
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm going to be able to keep my promise.

535
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,250
Yi In Jwa.

536
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:23,710
After this night passes, the troops from Yeongnam and Honam will join us.

537
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:30,630
Would 100,000 troops be unable to cross that measly Jukju Mountain Fortress?

538
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,260
I knew it would be this way.

539
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:40,020
Jeong Hee Ryang and Park Pil Hyeon are already finished.

540
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,890
What are you talking about?

541
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:49,280
It's already over, I said.

542
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:09,060
Honam's Park Pil Hyeon's hands are already bound.

543
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,920
From the looks of it, you're not men who've only held hoes in your hands.

544
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,020
Same with Yeongnam's Jeong Hee Ryang.

545
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,870
I received word from them that they will surely be arriving soon.

546
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,300
Did you by chance...

547
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,880
Do you think I only stood in their way?

548
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,880
When you enter the afterworld, sincerely repent your wrongdoings.

549
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,970
Then... Even Park Pil Hyeon?

550
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,390
That bastard Yi In Jwa, sprays blood everywhere he goes.

551
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,730
A Great Cause that kills the people.

552
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,400
I guess that's the Great Cause that you keep bringing up.

553
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,400
It's not a name that any dog like you can bring up.

554
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:45,490
I'll be sure to see whether your mouth will still be that lively after you lose your head.

555
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,200
Then I leave the aftermath to you.

556
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:06,440
There are no reinforcements. So why don't you give up now?

557
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,660
Yi In Jwa, your selfish ambition is over.

558
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,840
What did you say?

559
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:18,540
What are you doing, not tying this rascal up?

560
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,330
Warrior Hwang.

561
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:46,190
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

562
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,810
What are you doing?

563
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,100
You said it yourself:

564
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,500
"A country for the people,"

565
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,730
and that you would establish a King who would look after his people.

566
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:10,330
But not only were you unable to even fill the stomachs of the hungry people,

567
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:16,310
you made the flesh of the people into cannon fodder!

568
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,260
I contemplated it a lot.

569
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:28,440
Shall I let you live, or shall I die with you?

570
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,170
Still, since you were a nobleman I served as my master,

571
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:38,730
shouldn't I be the one to send you off?

572
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:44,020
Let's not be shameful towards each other.

573
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:49,200
You can't!

574
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:58,390
This fellow's life is the people's. The time is not now.

575
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,950
Throw down your hoes and kneel.

576
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:10,700
All of you, lay down your weapons.

577
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,990
- Arrest him.
 - Yes, Sir!

578
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,800
Yi In Jwa. It's over now.

579
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,830
You bastard, Baek Dae Gil.

580
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,960
♬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  ♬

581
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:56,530
♬  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  ♬

582
01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:01,780
♬  Because the words which have not yet been said  remain  ♬

583
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:07,890
♬  Because I cannot live in a time without you  ♬

 Preview 

585
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,260
 Don't think of dying easily. Repent your wrongdoing before the people, then die. 

586
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:18,510
 You will come to know that I, Yi In Jwa, am a needed human! 

587
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,370
 That man wouldn't give up even though he died. 

588
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:24,380
 Who took part in the poisoning of the Crown Prince? 

589
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,380
 Their acquaintances, in-laws, even their third cousins. Have them all arrested and brought in. 

590
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,450
 People from all across the eight provinces are lauding this fellow named Bae Dae Gil as their King. 

591
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,980
 Wouldn't it be possible to go back to His Highness, like before? 

592
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,700
 I heard there was someone who was acting as the people's king, so I decided to pay a visit. 

593
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,620
 Today I have come to kill you.
