1
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,260
 Kim Chang Jip's return
 (In 1712, during the Qing Dynasty, he was selected to go to China for a “Cultural Exchange Program.”) 

2
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,380
 (Six years later, in 1717, he returned home.) 

3
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,250
 Lee Geon Myeong (Left Prime Minister) 

4
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,310
Jo Tae Che (Public Council Leader) 
Lee Yee Myeong (Privy Council Leader)

5
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,700
 Kim Chang Jip 

6
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,970
 Heo Baek Gi, Head Master of Market Trading 

7
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,630
 Episode 9 

8
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,670
Lord Kim Chang Jip.

9
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,100
How many years has it been?

10
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,770
Left State Councilor. It's good to see you again.

11
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,650
The old tiger has come back to this place to die.

12
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,640
 King Sookjong 

13
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,030
You have gotten old.

14
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,010
How many years have passed?

15
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,900
Six years, Your Majesty.

16
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,660
I have saved the position of Prime Minister for you.

17
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,020
Please lead the court well.

18
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,670
I highly appreciate you, Your Majesty.

19
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,050
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

20
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,850
 Crown Prince Yoon (later, King Gyeongjong) 

21
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,480
Why on earth are you not allowing us see His Highness?

22
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,930
I have to see his sick condition with my own eyes.

23
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,700
My Lord, not now, please.

24
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,110
 Jo Il Soo (Left Minister) 

25
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,490
Anybody there?

26
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,350
Were you looking for me, Your Highness?

27
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,580
On the day of my Royal Mother being sent into exile,

28
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,190
I really regarded you as someone like a tremendous mountain.  (Someone with great power) 

29
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,720
I thought you could protect me.

30
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,580
That's why I joined hands with you.

31
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,010
Are you not trusting me?

32
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,150
 What kind of man he is,  

33
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,710
 what kind of ambition he has, and what his goals are 

34
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,150
 and how far he has spread his roots in this royal court.   

35
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,850
 Do you know about it? 

36
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,180
It's more than a matter of not trusting you,

37
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,620
I just want to confirm it from you.

38
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,850
I...

39
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,890
I've already told Your Highness

40
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,550
that I'll just take your considerations.

41
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,900
You are controlling the government officials according to your own whim,

42
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,970
owning the gambling houses in the eight provinces, and even garnering money  from the market trading company.

43
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,540
And you are saying that you are helping me without any ulterior motive?

44
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,450
You want me to believe that?

45
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,290
I'm asking if you can just stop where you are at or not.

46
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,010
I need a throne.

47
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,500
And a monarch as well.

48
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,410
The political factions and the party interests, as well as the Four Classes (Scholars, Farmers, Merchants and Artisans).

49
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,410
I need a throne that will not be disturbed by them.

50
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,330
Taking care of the subjects while on that throne,

51
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,270
and leading Joseon into a peaceful reign.

52
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,360
I need a monarch like that.

53
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,850
In the end, do you also want to sit on the throne?

54
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,620
Your Highness.

55
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,570
Your Highness will become

56
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,100
a great monarch who will be engraved

57
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,520
in history forever.

58
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,020
Are you telling me the truth?

59
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,420
Under me, there is the tiger-like Lord Kim Chang Jip...

60
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,070
Above me, there is a tiger a hundred times stricter than that,

61
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,190
my Royal Father...

62
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,970
I can't even breathe properly.

63
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,600
If they're not crazy, just what kind of an assassin announces their threat publicly?

64
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,620
Lord Yeon Sang thinks

65
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,970
that it's the Sorons' doing. 
 (Soron, "New Learning": a political party in the Joseon court) 

66
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,260
Are they even that audacious?

67
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,560
There seems to be a rat hidden in the palace.

68
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,870
If I stop you...

69
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,400
What will you do if I try to stop you?

70
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,440
Then one of us will die.

71
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,270
So? By all means, you want to kill the king?

72
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,780
Do you really want to become a traitor?

73
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,400
Just as you have your reasons, I, too, have my own reasons.

74
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,750
Step aside.

75
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,570
Whether I am an assassin or a traitor,

76
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,280
it won't change the fact I am your master.

77
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,290
I'll come back late, so don't wait for me.

78
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,490
 I don't want to  lose another precious person again. 

79
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,690
 I'll save him. I'll save my master. 

80
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,130
Are you ready?

81
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,090
If you use  the time when the palace is in panic because of an assassin,

82
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,530
there will surely be a moment when the king is unguarded.

83
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,920
Dam Seo,  you just need to watch for that opportunity.

84
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,750
If you unsheath your sword,

85
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,070
don't look  back.

86
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,120
Don't rush. Do it calmly... as you have learned it...

87
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,050
Do you understand?

88
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,030
Seriously though. I don't understand my Lord's intention at all.
   

89
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,440
Mu Myeong, do you understand him?

90
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,300
If there is anything you want, even if it's to gain just one thing,

91
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,260
it is the law that you must give something back as well.

92
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,390
Even if it's bone-shattering pain.

93
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,150
My Lord, what brings you here?

94
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,150
This house reeks with a stench.  (suspicious activity) 

95
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,640
When did it start?

96
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,940
What do you mean?

97
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm asking, when did you start hiding behind the Crown Prince,

98
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,770
and controlling the Soron faction?

99
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,340
I don't understand your meaning,

100
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,980
but do you intend to catch me?

101
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,450
Don't you think I can't catch a slippery mudfish that  makes the water muddy?

102
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:41,750
How do you distinguish between a slippery mudfish and a 1,000-year-old serpent?

103
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,650
You don't even know the field you have cultivated is full of rocks.

104
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,680
But you want to keep going.

105
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,300
I have cultivated it for several dozen years.

106
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,340
I have sown and watered.

107
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,780
It's now time to harvest.

108
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,900
Let us wait and see.

109
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,350
Just how far can you go with no connection or position?

110
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,040
 Kim Che Geon 

111
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,430
 Remove the sheath and discard it. 

112
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,210
 I'm telling you to wield that sword as much as you want. 

113
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:07,650
From the time of Yushi (5–7 PM), including the four main gates of Hyanyang, block off all of the other gates.

114
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,430
And as for the citizens, until the time of Myoshi (5–7 AM),

115
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,550
all activity will cease! And if they do not follow this order,

116
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,390
regardless of their status, they will be punished severely!

117
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:32,410
Tonight! We must not tolerate any misbehavior!

118
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,990
- Do you understand? 
  - Yes, Sir!

119
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,960
Your Highness, Prince Yeoning...

120
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:01,050
This father's life is in your hands.

121
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,350
But Royal Father... Just why is Royal Father so...

122
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,890
Just why am I so calm?

123
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,240
Do you think I am sitting on this throne because of sheer luck?

124
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,920
How about this?

125
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,130
Why don't we make a bet?

126
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,510
When you say a bet, what do you mean...

127
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:36,770
Look.  The Jade Seal is right in front of you.  (The Jade Seal signifies royal proof as a king) 

128
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,750
Royal Father.

129
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,060
Catch the assassin.

130
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,150
Then all of this will be yours to keep.

131
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,570
But if you don't catch the assassin, I will die,

132
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,930
and the Crown Prince will reign as king.

133
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,750
When that happens, you will have to leave this palace immediately.

134
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:30,180
Your Majesty. Although your son does not have the right to make bets with you,

135
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,440
I will most definitely catch the assassin.

136
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:41,250
Should I tell you... the method of how to obtain this throne?

137
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:00,150
 When it comes to assassins, once you remove their masks, they are all eventually people who were beside you. 

138
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:06,250
 Meaning, most are people whom I have cherished. 

139
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,020
 Think about this well. 

140
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,090
Your Highness.

141
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,530
Follow me.

142
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,610
The King's chamber. Is it over that way?

143
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,520
Captain of the Royal Guards?

144
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,900
He has entrusted me with the Royal Guards and the Police Force,

145
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,150
and ordered me to protect him from the assassination attempt that will occur tonight.

146
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:09,480
Prince Yeoning. This is a test. His Majesty is testing you.

147
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,240
Yes. I too, know that well.

148
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,730
And so, with this opportunity, of course to the King,

149
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,350
but to the other governing ministers as well, I will prove myself well in front of them.

150
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,590
Do you perhaps... suspect someone?

151
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,930
No, I do not.

152
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,360
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

153
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,630
San Gil, are you out there?

154
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,150
- Yes, Your Highness. 
 - Since anything can happen, you stay by my Royal Mother and guard her.

155
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,130
Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,950
Just what is this nonsense? What if His Majesty really loses his—

157
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,950
As His Majesty's Minister, how dare you utter such words?

158
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:35,050
Lord. It does seem this entire situation is going quite strangely.

159
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,000
The assassin is definitely aiming for His Majesty...

160
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Yet, why... do I feel a chill going down my neck?

161
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,230
Isn't it very strange?

162
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,250
The Crown Prince just folds his hands behind his back and stays still.

163
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,150
But Prince Yeoning became a captain of the King's guard and is protecting His Majesty.

164
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,160
Lord, by any chance, could you be thinking...

165
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,070
 Captain of King's guard... 

166
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:14,130
 Could His Majesty's heart really be leaning towards Prince Yeoning? 

167
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,460
That's strange. I'm sure it was here.

168
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,000
Who are you?

169
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,060
Get him!

170
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,520
- Look for him!
- Yes, Sir!

171
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,850
Baek Dae Gil?

172
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,400
What are you doing here?

173
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,450
I don't have time to explain. I'm sorry.

174
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,620
♬  I want to love you  ♬

175
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,960
♬    Even though I live only for a day   ♬

176
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,880
♬   I miss you    ♬

177
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,400
♬   from inside my heart deep    ♬

178
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,660
 For calling the man who killed my father your teacher, 

179
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,240
 Dam Seo, you're just the same beast. 

180
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:29,010
 I take it back. I take back my word that I'd take you for my wife. 

181
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,890
 I'm taking it back. 

182
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,330
♬   you trickle away   ♬

183
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,730
You said you wanted to kill my teacher, didn't you?

184
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,990
I understand that feeling as well.

185
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,750
♬   I will not wave my hand   ♬

186
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,260
Because I also have...

187
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,970
♬   Under the same sky   ♬

188
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,000
someone whom I hate so much that I want to kill him.

189
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,130
♬   we will meet for sure   ♬

190
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:01,310
This night is my only chance,

191
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,580
♬   Even just for the time being  ♬

192
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,870
so please pretend that you don't know about what I'm doing.

193
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,580
What if I can't do that?

194
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,990
Why?

195
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:16,610
I'm not even going to be your wife anyway.

196
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:22,610
♬  Please don't forget   ♬

197
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,850
 Master... 

198
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,910
Is it the king?

199
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,130
The person you're going to kill.

200
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,710
And what if it is?

201
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,580
Then let's go together.

202
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,520
It's not your business.

203
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,110
I have my own person whom I am looking for.

204
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,420
Let's jump over this wall and go together.

205
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,880
There! Stop right there!

206
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,280
Stop! Get him!

207
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,340
Over there, stop!

208
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,810
  The wretch must raise a disturbance at Gaehak Gate, 

209
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,270
 and distract the guards toward there. 

210
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,820
 Dam Seo, use only the Bonghwa Gate. 

211
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,860
Catch him!

212
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,740
Over there! Catch him!

213
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,290
Catch him!

214
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,370
An assassin!  An assassin intruded through Gaehak Gate!

215
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,820
Why is the guard so inattentive at Yaemoon Gate?

216
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,100
Pardon?

217
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,190
Could it be only the two of you?

218
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,560
Yes.

219
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,180
 Everyone stationed at Gwangmyeong-dong has all gone to the eastern side. 

220
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,230
 Everyone has gathered towards the Gaehak Gate. 

221
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,280
 Therefore, the western side of the palace is empty. 

222
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,210
 So Gaehak Gate was only a diversion. 

223
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,710
 In the end, the actual path the assassin is going to take is... 

224
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,490
I sincerely

225
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:31,250
wished and hoped that it wouldn't be you, Dam Seo.

226
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:53,250
My Liege, just what do you want to gain, even by sending Dam Seo to the place of death in this kind of situation?

227
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,930
It's belief.

228
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,990
 I am wavering, Teacher. 

229
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,050
 So 

230
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:13,220
 are you thinking that it was I, not the king, who killed your father? 

231
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,610
 If a belief that you've always had collapses, 

232
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,970
 even if your great cause is a success, 

233
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,110
 only a feeling of emptiness will be left in your heart. 

234
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,740
Let us wait and see if tonight, Dam Seo

235
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,850
can take hold of her wavering belief

236
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:42,260
and can put the sword straight into the king's heart.

237
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,580
Everybody wants to kill the king.

238
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,700
Then should I go see the king?

239
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,240
Have you no intention at all of taking a step back?

240
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,480
 If you fail to catch the assassin, I'll die and won't be here any more. 

241
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,840
 The crown prince will succeed to the throne. 

242
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,960
 Then you must leave this court, instantly. 

243
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:50,360
If you are not able to slash my neck, please just stay over there.

244
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,120
Please.

245
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,780
It's still not too late. Are you really unable to stop?

246
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,020
Are you prepared to die?

247
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,220
Do you really wish to die?

248
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Over there! Prince Yeoning, Your Highness!

249
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,060
Your Highness. Are you okay?

250
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,340
The assassin. Where did the assassin go?

251
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,020
That way.

252
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,480
What's wrong?

253
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,880
Just now... Never mind.

254
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,880
Who is there?

255
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,140
An assassin! Attack him!

256
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,520
Indeed, you have no fear of  heaven.

257
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,720
So shall I see

258
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,280
whether you are capable of being the owner of that sword?

259
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,600
Step aside.

260
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,680
I have no intention of stepping aside.

261
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,220
You have no murderous intent.

262
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,360
However,

263
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,560
if you come one more step closer, you'll die.

264
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,920
Do you think you can stop me with just arrows?

265
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,640
Try to come one more step closer, then you'll find out.

266
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,220
Stop!

267
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,220
How dare you...

268
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,500
Take away the knife!

269
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,440
Just why on earth is a bastard like you even here?!

270
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,280
I am his disciple.

271
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,440
What are you doing?

272
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,740
I came here to save you, Master.

273
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,180
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

274
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,940
It has been a while, Kim Che Geon.

275
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,420
There is no assassin.

276
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,880
If there is something, it is only the king's trick.

277
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,440
What in the world are you talking about?

278
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,700
Declaring the assassination with the time of day and hour?

279
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,480
Have you ever seen an assassin as foolish as that?

280
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,560
Then you're saying this was all planned by the king?

281
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,760
But for what reason?

282
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,780
The reasons... there are many.

283
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,480
It could be to check the state of the royal guards during urgent situations.

284
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,460
Or it could have been to test Prince Yeoning's ability.

285
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,920
All these things are done by the king's order.

286
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,820
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

287
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,680
So how was it?

288
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,240
I jumped over the palace walls more than ten times in about a month's time, but I was not discovered once.

289
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,160
It was difficult to breach the four main gates of Hanyang because of the strict watch.

290
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,780
The gatekeepers at Gyeongbok Palace are inattentive.

291
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,880
The crown prince's guards don't do their job properly either.

292
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,300
It didn't even take a moment to get to the king's chamber once I entered the palace.

293
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,420
Please double the guards at the King's chamber and the main building.

294
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,550
The Naesamcheong (three branches of royal guards: Naegeumui, Woorimui, Gyeomsabok) including Naegeumui need to have their military disciplines rectified anew.

295
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,440
However, the king's ultimate goal is to catch me.

296
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,650
"I will give you a chance, so come if you can."

297
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,790
He just threw a challenge at me.

298
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:48,010
And so, I have responded to his challenge.

299
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,070
Responding, you don't mean...

300
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:56,530
It can't be... Is that why you sent Dam Seo there as an assassin?

301
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,820
So who is that child?

302
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,530
He is my immature disciple.

303
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,190
What is your name?

304
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,730
My name is Baek Dae Gil.

305
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,720
Come closer.

306
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,690
Come even closer.

307
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,630
Who are your parents?

308
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,790
Both of them have passed away, and so I have nobody left.

309
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,120
I will entrust this sword to you.

310
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:09,030
This is a sword that I cherish very dearly.

311
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,440
What are you doing? Show your respect and accept that sword.

312
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,680
- Kim Che Geon. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

313
00:44:52,680 --> 00:45:00,100
Since I will be entrusting and supporting you as the King's Swordsman, use your great martial art skills for Joseon.

314
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,080
Also, the saving tag that I bestow on you

315
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,620
will save your life one day.

316
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,180
Your grace is boundless, Your Majesty.

317
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,880
Don't relax just yet.

318
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,640
It's not over yet.

319
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,890
Die, King!

320
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,610
You men stay here and protect His Majesty.

321
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,180
Your Majesty!

322
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,060
This was all apparently a training drill ordered by His Majesty.

323
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,370
Training drill, you say? I see.

324
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,310
Catch her! She went that way!

325
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,030
Didn't you say this was a training drill? Hurry up and go see what's going on.

326
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,610
Yes, Your Highness.

327
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,070
My Lord. Please answer this.

328
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,930
Did you purposely push Dam Seo into the trap the King set?

329
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:04,930
Have I not told you this before? In order to gain something, you must give something away as well.

330
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,910
My Lord!

331
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:11,530
Do not worry. That child Dam Seo will not die.

332
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,010
How can you be so sure?

333
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:22,300
Because there is you, Mu Myeong, who are worried about Dam Seo.

334
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,900
There is also Hwang Jin Gi.

335
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,280
And Prince Yeoning.

336
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,080
Stop! Catch her!

337
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,870
Catch her!

338
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,830
Find her!

339
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,720
Catch her!

340
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:43,190
And Baek Dae Gil will most likely be there as well.

341
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,700
Did you lose the assassin?

342
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,980
Your Highness.

343
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:11,370
The assassin probably went toward the palace gate.

344
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,530
Yes, Your Highness!

345
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,180
 Wait. In case you fail your mission, 

346
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,860
 and you are put into a position where you can't escape the palace, 

347
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,860
 there will be only one person who can save you. 

348
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,420
 That is Lady Choi Sook Bin. 

349
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,460
Please let me live, Your Highness.

350
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:20,800
Have I not told you to cherish your life?

351
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,320
In the end, you decided to draw a sword  (live dangerously) ?

352
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,500
Who are you?

353
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,830
My name is Baek Dae Gil.

354
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,570
 Although we couldn't find Baek Man Geum's body, 

355
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:50,700
 it seems that his son wanted to take revenge on Lee In Jwa and— 

356
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,290
 Did you just say his son? 

357
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,910
 Yes. His name is Baek Dae Gil. 

358
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,950
 But why do you ask? 

359
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,860
Royal Mother.

360
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,350
I heard it was just a training drill, so why have you come?

361
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:13,810
It's possible that the assassin might have come in here. Have you not seen the assassin?

362
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:17,590
No, I have not. I have not seen anyone.

363
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:24,040
I see. But just in case, I will search your room.

364
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,810
Go ahead.

365
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:47,140
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

366
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,460
Do you really think that I am harboring the assassin in my room?

367
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,790
I only searched as a precaution.

368
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,610
In any case, your son will now take his leave.

369
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:11,270
What is your relationship with this girl?

370
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,400
We just had some business with each other in the past.

371
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,670
Your father is Baek Man Geum, right?

372
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,310
How does Your Majesty know about that...?

373
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,400
I heard it through Prince Yeoning.

374
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,870
I see.

375
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,000
How have you lived your life?

376
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,180
Were you with your father this entire time?

377
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,850
Just why is Your Highness asking this...?

378
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,560
Now what do you plan to do?

379
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:54,870
I only hid this girl out of the debt that I owed her,

380
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,550
but you can not stay here for much longer.

381
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:10,700
 If you drag your time out any longer, it will become harder for you to escape this palace. 

382
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,190
What do you think you're doing here?

383
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,360
So you have become Joseon's Best Swordman, Kim Che Geon's disciple.

384
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,800
It seems you have learned some martial arts and become a bit more mature,

385
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,310
but you won't be able to take Dam Seo out of this palace.

386
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,430
If you did it by yourself, of course.

387
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:39,350
I only feigned ignorance earlier for the sake of my Royal Mother,

388
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,850
but I have a plan, and before it's too late, take Dam Seo out.

389
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:59,370
 I will prepare a horse, and you go and open the palace gate. 

390
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,150
This is a restricted area. Stop right there!

391
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:07,650
Halt!

392
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,430
Your Highness, it seems  they have just escaped the palace.

393
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:52,050
 Dae Gil... Please be safe. 

394
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,520
Are you a Royal Guard?

395
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,370
That sword. Where'd you get it?

396
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:25,640
I said, where'd you get it?!

397
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,140
What use does it serve you if you know?

398
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:34,980
Is it you? Are you that Hyungnim Tiger's disciple?

399
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:39,550
So you are. You're that Kim Che Geon's disciple, aren't you?

400
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,580
Master... You know my Master?

401
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,620
Do you think I just know him?

402
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:51,320
I have a lot of  interest  in your Master.

403
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,290
For one statue of Buddha, I'll take one life.

404
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:12,090
What? Did your Master really not mention me?

405
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:17,110
 Ah! There is one actually. He wasn't up to my level, 

406
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,270
 but there was a guy 

407
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,600
 that was almost up to my feet. 

408
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,050
 He used to be an officer who served the king, and his strength was great. 

409
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:29,000
 He even beats tigers barehanded. 

410
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,430
Hwang Jin Gi.

411
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,250
♬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  ♬

412
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:07,710
♬  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  ♬

413
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:13,100
♬  Because the words which have not yet been said  remain  ♬

414
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,250
 Jackpot 
♬  Because I cannot live a time without you  ♬

415
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,500
 The man who killed your father, Il Soo, is your teacher, Lee In Jwa. 

416
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,530
 The assassin has already died. 

417
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,290
 This is what you've brought upon yourself. 

418
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,950
 Since that child, Baek Dae Gil's aura is so great, I can no longer see him. 

419
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,880
 Now the training is complete. 

420
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,430
 Thank you, Master. I'm sincerely grateful. 

421
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:36,270
 - What's with the crying? It's an embarrassment as a man. 
 - What is going on here? 

422
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,050
 Your Highness. Will you consider our thoughts? 

423
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,420
 Is this really what Royal Father wants? 

424
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,980
 THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BETRAYING THIS LEE IN JWA! 

425
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,510
 How many more are there? 

426
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,840
 Let's go easy. I clearly said, let's go easy. 

427
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,620
 Oh my! It seems our gambling nobles have come a long way! 

428
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:55,220
 - What are you? 
  - I am a hunting dog that is used to hunt Lee In Jwa. 

429
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,290
 Have you become a tiger now? 

430
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:58,930
 Baek Dae Gil... 

431
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:15,060
♬  Will your heart be with me then?  ♬

432
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,180
♬  Longing for you even if my tears well up  ♬

433
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:30,670
♬  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  ♬

434
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:35,920
♬  Because the words which have not yet been said  remain  ♬

435
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:43,270
♬  Because I cannot live a time without you  ♬

436
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:49,390
♬  I call out for you again. The more my heart races.   ♬

437
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:52,800
♬  Going to you again  the more I am breathless  ♬
