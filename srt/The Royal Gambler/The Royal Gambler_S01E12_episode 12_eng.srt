 Episode 12 

2
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,900
 Timing and Subtitling by the Totally Awesome Team @ Viki.com 

3
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,320
The smell sure is disgusting.

4
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,400
Hey Ace of Sixes, stop fooling around and come at me.

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
What did you say?

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,730
As I see how you guys act, I don't feel like being a human any more.

7
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,480
I want to kill you by ripping you apart right now,

8
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,750
but I am restraining myself mightily,

9
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,240
so stop this nonsense and fight me properly.

10
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,810
Do you want to die?

11
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,490
Yes, you have to react like that, you bastard.

12
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,720
So now I can kill you.

13
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,760
Stop it.

14
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,490
Long time no see.

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,740
Baek Dae Gil.

16
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,890
Seol Im

17
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,060
You, did you come here to take the Ace of Sixes' head?

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,140
Why? Is it weird meeting like this?

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,620
Why did Dog Blade's plaything come here?

20
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,520
If you get an ax mark on this pretty face,

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,540
it will be hard to look at.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,450
Our master said to deliver this message to you.

23
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,000
Even if you are going to lose, leave your neck behind.

24
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,500
Stop roaming around and get lost, you wench.

25
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,350
I can't do that.

26
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,370
Master said to protect your neck.

27
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,160
Come have a talk with me.

28
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,050
Let go of my hands.

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,200
The Seol Im you knew no longer exists.

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,000
I belong to Dog Blade now.

31
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,350
Stop chit-chatting, shall we get started?

32
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,110
I guess I'm not late.

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,380
Gosh, here comes an annoying nobleman again.

34
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,430
What is it?

35
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,320
I can't miss such a rare, interesting game.

36
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,440
Play well.

37
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,950
By tomorrow morning, rumors will be spreading through the streets.

38
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,790
That the almighty Ace of Sixes is now history will spread.

39
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,600
Where's the game money?

40
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,990
Lee In Jwa.

41
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,090
I took twelve gambling houses away from that man in the countryside.

42
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,090
From there, the land and house deeds and the receivable accounts, all of them add up to at least ten thousand nyangs.

43
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,520
On top of that, I bet my life.

44
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,720
You sure are coming out strong.

45
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,250
Then what should I bet?

46
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,800
The ownership of this gambling  house and your life.

47
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,620
Fine.

48
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,160
A man cannot back off from his pride.

49
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,150
I am sorry to interfere in an interesting bet,

50
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,460
but what about giving an opportunity to the spectators as well?

51
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,950
I want to bet on the winning side.

52
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,150
Isn't a bet something like this?

53
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,170
I mean I feel jealous watching only the two of you having fun.

54
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,830
What are you scheming?

55
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,400
Bet on it. If you want to bet, you should.

56
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,940
I'm betting five thousand nyangs.

57
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,160
Hey, White-Faced Scholar!

58
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,810
It seems like you are making a mistake.

59
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes, even in the afterlife there is order.

60
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,750
Are you done?

61
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,040
Let's start.

62
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,520
I was about to die from waiting.
 Hwang Jin Gi 

63
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,510
My Lord, the Prince.

64
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,360
Who are you?

65
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,030
Do you know me?

66
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,720
Of course I know you.

67
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,460
Are you looking for this?

68
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,580
Hwang Jin Gi.

69
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh,  it is an honor that even a high noble like you recognizes me.

70
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,310
A soldier that used to live off the royal court, in the end

71
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,440
became Lee In Jwa's dog?

72
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,590
Dog? That's not right.

73
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,620
Why? Did you get scared?

74
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,310
I haven't even drawn my sword yet.

75
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,770
One life for one statue.

76
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,730
 We should act separately?  

77
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,390
 You should catch the Ace of Sixes. 

78
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,170
 I will search his vault and take the documents. 

79
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,830
Your Highness, come here quickly before I bash that door down.

80
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,300
As I thought about it.

81
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,900
I don't think I can move all the documents in this room by myself.

82
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,690
How about helping me out?

83
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,040
I will pay you very well.

84
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,260
Why? You don't want to?

85
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,540
What are you doing right now?

86
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,720
I guess you don't like it.

87
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,030
Then I have no choice.

88
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,530
This. You keep this.

89
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,420
So are you done talking?

90
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:22,610
Now I will finish this game with a double six. You know what happens next, right?

91
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,800
The disgustingly lucky bastard, that is me.

92
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,460
 One is six and the other is broken. 

93
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,830
Since it's not a double six, you can't even finish it in this round. So what now?

94
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,110
You are saying you broke it with the strength of your grip?

95
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,020
I don't know what you are talking about.

96
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,780
Well this turn was void anyway.

97
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,200
What do you mean void? Who says so?

98
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,040
It is a void turn.

99
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,070
If a die breaks, it's a do-over. That is the basic rule of this two-die game. Didn't you even know that?

100
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,410
Bring in a new die.

101
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,010
This.  Isn't this a face die?

102
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,300
What are you saying?

103
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,340
It seems to be a set of dice that only gives double sixes.

104
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,660
Change it.

105
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,310
Change it.

106
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,090
Change it.

107
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,710
Change it.

108
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,660
Hey, stop fooling around.

109
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,970
Fooling around? What do you mean fooling around when my life depends on this turn?

110
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,850
Change it to cheap dice that are sold on the market instead of the dice that are made in this house.

111
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,860
Does anyone have a die?

112
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,040
Do you now have any more complaints?

113
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,160
I don't have.

114
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,440
You know this, right? Everything ends if I get a double six.

115
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,700
I'm saying your neck is mine.

116
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,950
Hey, Ace of Sixes, since things turned out like this, what about making things more interesting?

117
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:13,260
If those dice come up double three, I win, but anything else and you win.

118
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,860
What are you saying? So I win if it's not a double three?

119
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
But if I win,

120
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,760
their lives are all mine.

121
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,420
Look at this bastard.

122
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,600
Your gut is surely the number one in Joseon. Are you confident?

123
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,620
Why? Are you scared?

124
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,970
Hah, look at this bastard.

125
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:48,520
Fine, if it comes up  double three, I will give all those guys' lives to you.

126
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,140
Open it.

127
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,820
One moment.

128
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:03,410
You, Ace of Sixes. You might lose everything on this turn.

129
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,310
Hey White-Faced Scholar, I'm the Ace of Sixes.

130
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,710
I'm telling you, I am the Ace of Sixes.

131
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,270
Then

132
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,540
 Threeâ€”Three 

133
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,400
What is this?!

134
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,890
Now spit out the money you've swallowed.

135
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,560
The bloody tears you sucked on, spit it all out.

136
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,950
Who are you seriously?

137
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,300
I already said it, I am disgustingly lucky.

138
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,400
You bastard!

139
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,260
Have you ever killed someone?

140
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,420
Stop acting all cool

141
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,300
and try to kill me. I'm saying to try to kill me, you bastard!

142
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,960
Don't misinterpret it. It's not that I can't kill you. I'm just giving you away to someone else.

143
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,660
To those people.

144
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,340
Give us back our money.

145
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,050
You worm-like bastards.

146
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,110
Do you guys want to die?

147
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:04,850
Die, my father's and mother's enemy!

148
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,770
Do you want me to tell you something?

149
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,010
Why your father died?

150
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,040
 I am betting for the last time. 

151
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,480
He put poison on my drink. So...

152
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,300
- Are you okay?
 -What are you saying? Aish.

153
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,510
I was staying beside Dog Blade in order to take my revenge on you.

154
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:46,570
I endured till now through everything just to take my revenge on you.

155
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:52,350
To take my revenge on you, my revenge on you!

156
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,730
Kill the Ace of Sixes!

157
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,470
Kill him! Kill him!

158
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,810
Are you guys going to just sit back and watch while your master is getting beat up here?

159
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,710
Did you think I wouldn't have a backup like this?

160
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,650
Isn't it you, Prince Yeoning?

161
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,630
What brings you here?

162
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,230
Why are you here?

163
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,350
I came to witness the Ace of Sixes' last moments at Seoso Gate.

164
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,190
Wasn't the Ace of Sixes your man?

165
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,270
What do you mean trash like him is my man?

166
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:28,550
Your Highness, I understand that you are busy with your work, but you have to always keep in mind

167
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,290
whether you have forgotten something or missed something.

168
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:37,590
In the old sayings, they said to even knock on a stone bridge before crossing.  (don't even trust a sure thing) 

169
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,710
What do you mean by that?

170
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,570
Then I will take my leave.

171
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,790
The punch you threw at me last time,

172
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:56,010
soon you will get it back two and three times stronger.

173
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:03,550
Perhaps you might have to give up everything you have.

174
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,890
I will depart now.

175
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,710
Then let's meet again.

176
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,110
Your Highness.

177
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,810
Stop!

178
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,190
Violence? Did you guys forget that there is the righteous national law?

179
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,190
This man is not a human but a beast! A beast!

180
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,270
Yes, he is worse than a beast!

181
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,230
He has to die.

182
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,150
I will ask for forgiveness.

183
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,950
Your Highness.

184
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,050
For making the people in this land angry,

185
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,290
for failing to notice the tears of the people,

186
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,350
and for letting the people collapse to the ground,

187
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,250
on the behalf of the king and crown prince,

188
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,230
and the ministers of the royal courts,

189
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,630
I ask for forgiveness.

190
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:02,190
So, please stop.

191
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,910
Your Highness, please stand up now.

192
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:30,170
Human trafficking, illegal slave documents have all turned into ashes.

193
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,490
So take these people out and leave.

194
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,790
And this gambling house that caused wicked acts will soonâ€”

195
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,730
Fire, there's fire!

196
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,870
Hurry! Hurry to escape!

197
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,050
Arrest that man immediately.

198
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,070
Yes, Your Highness.

199
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:16,730
I am not going to take a single step from this gambling house.

200
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,850
Kill me. I am going to die here.

201
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,910
He died!

202
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,310
We have gained our freedom!

203
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,130
We are now free!

204
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,570
 Father and Mother, are you watching from the heavens? 

205
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,970
Let's go now.

206
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,310
What in the world are you saying? Non-chartered merchants union,

207
00:29:52,310 --> 00:30:01,530
I put my life on the line and erased the Ace of Sixes' stamp, but now you are saying you do not have the ledger?

208
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,470
 How shall I live after this contemptible life is saved?
Baek Joong Gi (Head of Small Merchant League) 

209
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,730
Whom am I going to blame?

210
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,230
Did you say that the man who took the ledger  is Swindler Golsa?

211
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,500
Dae Gil, I heard all the rumors.

212
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Well, still, I was a famous gambler back in the days.

213
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,230
Did you think I wouldn't know about that rumor?

214
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,870
But who is that woman?

215
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,330
I am Seol Im. Gye Seol Im.

216
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,350
Seol Im? And not Seol Lim? ( heart flutter )

217
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:27,000
So what do you do?

218
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,370
Could you be in a relationship with him?

219
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,350
Stop with the nonsense. It's not something like that.

220
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,590
Then why are you going around with a full-grown woman?

221
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,710
- We have some reasons.
-There are no reasons between a man and a woman.

222
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,630
So are your parents alive?

223
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,650
They passed away long ago to the Ace of Sixes.

224
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,510
But now it's fine.  It's all thanks to Dae Gil.

225
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:10,750
Oh, I see. So how old are you?

226
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,810
I turn twenty this year.

227
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,310
Oh, that is a perfect age.

228
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:22,310
Grandpa, it's not what you are thinking about, so just eat quietly.

229
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:27,170
Hey, you bastard. Are you a son of a human or a pig?

230
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,860
Does the food go down your throat with a pretty woman like this next to you?

231
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,180
Here, hurry up and eat.

232
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,130
What are you doing here? You are going to mess up your pretty hands.

233
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,870
Leave it, just leave it and go inside.

234
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,790
I have to pay for the food, so Grandpa, today go inside and rest.

235
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,050
I thought you were just pretty on the outside, but you are on the inside as well.

236
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:11,030
Dae Gil, it seems like you brought her here with a plan.

237
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,010
So why don't you just set up a wedding ceâ€”

238
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,730
I said it's not what you think.

239
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,830
That guy.

240
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,830
I heard the rumor, but you are unharmed?

241
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,010
What harm would there be when a single piece of trash disappears?

242
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,930
I've heard that you bet on that child Baek Dae Gil.

243
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,910
The things you see are not everything.

244
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,370
Don't you think it is more clever

245
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,810
to take the remaining water than to just fill up a jar that is about to break?

246
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,910
Everyone is waiting for you.

247
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,650
Let's go.

248
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,190
Your cleverness is sure amazing.

249
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,300
How in the world did you clearly predict Prince Yeoning's action?

250
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,310
It's not even close to a petty trick.

251
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,570
But what is that?

252
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,730
Didn't you empty your storeroom because of me?

253
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:10,030
 Open up the storeroom for the people? 

254
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:19,200
 Yes, but   I will refill the storeroom you emptied for the people. 

255
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,310
 You will refill it again. 

256
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,010
 And we will gain the people's minds? 

257
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,390
Since you guys have opened up your storerooms for the people.

258
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:36,570
Of course it is the right thing for me to refill the storerooms.

259
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,850
You sure are amazing, sure are amazing.

260
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:47,070
However, Lord, have you met the Crown Prince?

261
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:54,690
I sure did, that also went as you mentioned before.

262
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,710
Then by now...

263
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,870
Your Majesty, did I just mishear?

264
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,950
You did not mishear.

265
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,910
From this point on, I am going to remove you from  the position I gave you in the Office of the Inspector General

266
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,910
What in the world is the reason for that?

267
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,170
You personally interfered with the common people's situation

268
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,030
and the fire in the gambling house in Seoso Gate.

269
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,330
And I have heard that someone died, and on top of that,

270
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,770
you knelt down.

271
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,930
You knelt down in the place of His Majesty.

272
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:44,470
It is not that I do not understand you but do you know

273
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,630
how dangerous your childish actions are?

274
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:55,290
Who do you think you are to dare to harm the king's status and how dare you...

275
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:00,170
How dare you ask for forgiveness on my behalf?

276
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:06,250
You won't have anything to say even if you have a hundred mouths. You will step down from all your positions

277
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,430
and for the meantime remain quiet.

278
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,690
Yes,  Your Highness.

279
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:42,150
It is such a relief since the wings of the almighty prince Yeoning  have come off.

280
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:48,170
He won't be able to talk about the abolition of the ban on non-chartered merchants anymore.

281
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:56,550
No, it's not, this is still not enough.

282
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,210
Many eyes inside and outside the royal court are watching you,

283
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,490
so you should have been careful, careful all the time.

284
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,630
I have nothing to say.

285
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:14,630
Your Highness, don't put yourself down, be confident.

286
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:23,690
You should meet His Majesty, you should meet the king and ask for help.

287
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,170
Aside from the king,

288
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,360
no one can help you.

289
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,550
 King Sookjong 

290
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,350
What brings you here?

291
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,240
I

292
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,700
have come to my royal father  to seek your advice.

293
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,270
Prince Yeonryong  (Lee Hyeon, the king's sixth son) 

294
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,690
Advice?

295
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,070
Did you say advice?

296
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,900
You stupid fool, who stabbed your own foot with a knife given to your hand.

297
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:28,300
What do you mean advice, huh?

298
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,910
Prince, go outside.

299
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:52,690
The position of Chief in the Office of the Inspector General,

300
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,750
what on earth does it mean to you?

301
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:03,610
You can't do anything if you don't have such a position?

302
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:09,630
I asked you don't you have anything if you don't have such a shell?

303
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,470
The public opinion looks like

304
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,850
the water in the container.

305
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:37,090
The water happens to flow toward the direction of the tilt of the container.

306
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,940
Are you water or container?

307
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:52,350
Deciding where to spill water has already depended on your hands. How do you ask?

308
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,860
Are you being dragged up without your backbone?

309
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,840
Whether you live or die,

310
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,280
you'd better act with your principle.

311
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:17,500
I'll keep your Royal Father's advice deeply in mind.

312
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,710
It's frustrating.

313
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,360
Do you know the whereabouts of Baek Dae Gil?

314
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,920
Back then, after I separated from you,

315
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,420
I had nowhere to go back to.

316
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,820
 With the life that was saved thanks to you, Dae Gil, I would avenge my father and mother. 

317
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,560
 I thought I would die without regret. 

318
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,050
 Damn it! 

319
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,100
 Damn it. 

320
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,080
 Don't touch the woman. 

321
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,770
 As of that day, I became Dog Blade's minion. 

322
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,770
 I said I would stay under him until I killed the Ace of Sixes. 

323
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,220
Now that it's all over,

324
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:54,040
I'm going to tell Dog Blade that I'm leaving.

325
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,230
I'm sorry.  About last nightâ€”

326
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,630
I took care of all the cleanup afterward.

327
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,350
How are you celebrating by yourselves?

328
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,060
Ah, the one from yesterday.  But who are you? 
(speaking informally)

329
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:33,820
How comes everybody around you has no manners?

330
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,120
I'm older than you.

331
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,400
What's that so important? We are friends.

332
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,580
What?

333
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,890
He said you are friends.

334
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,810
Dae Gil. Did you have this kind of friend, too?

335
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,040
Friend? Call me Hyungnim (older brother).

336
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,200
What are you saying?

337
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,890
What's your problem?  It's written all over your face.

338
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,530
Didn't you come looking for your hyungnim?

339
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,340
Just tell hyungnim everything frankly.

340
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,500
You... do you even know who I am while you're chattering away?

341
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,830
Why, are you His Royal Highness?

342
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,780
That's right.  I'm His Royal Highness.

343
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,910
- Yeah right.
- It's true.  He's His Royal Highness.

344
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,980
 Restaurant &amp; Lounge 

345
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,930
Just tell me why you came to see me.

346
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,490
It seems like you're thinking of cutting off Lee In Jwa's arms and legs.

347
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:51,040
Then are you planning to break Swindler Golsa at Mapo as well?

348
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,750
-If it's Swindler Golsaâ€”
- Arms.

349
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,890
What do you care whether I break Swindler Golsa or not?

350
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:05,130
Why? Are you worrying about Hyungnim? What a worry!

351
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,090
You bastard... You!

352
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,290
On your meal table,

353
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,700
I try to put my spoon and folk.

354
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,560
Tell me so that I can understand you easily.

355
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,910
My goal is to abolish the ban on non-chartered merchants and to cut off  the Lee In Jwa's fund strings.

356
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:33,420
Mercantile monopoly privilege.

357
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,910
That is the useless law that pushes the small non-chartered merchants to the point of death.

358
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:47,140
Anyhow, I need the ledger that the chartered merchants' wicked deeds were recorded on.

359
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,290
Swindler Golsa has that ledger.

360
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,230
Would it be all right if I spoke?

361
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,250
Put your arms down.

362
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,150
The thing is, about that Swindler Golsa.

363
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,380
I heard something.

364
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,970
Swindler Golsa?

365
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:15,590
Swindler Golsa, Golsa!  Where is that bastard Golsa?

366
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,760
Where is that damnable bastard?

367
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,130
Swindler Golsa!

368
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:33,360
In my life, there are exactly two bad relationships that I can't rid myself of.

369
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,630
The second one is the aloof scholar Lee In Jwa.

370
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,700
The first is Swindler Golsa.

371
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:48,740
My eye.  The one who took out my eye is that bastard Golsa.

372
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,400
On that day, I did run a swindle.

373
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,560
 Double eights. 

374
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,390
 Elder, if you swindle in this area, you know what happens to you, don't you? 

375
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:21,850
 If I don't have this hand, what will I use to touch money and women with? 

376
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:29,350
 That's why I'm not interested in your hand. 

377
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:38,380
 However, I like your eyeball. 

378
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,260
I heard something.

379
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,690
What is Swindler Golsa's specialty?

380
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,670
He doesn't have any specialty because he is a maker.

381
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,560
Maker?

382
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,950
Dominos, dice,  tags...

383
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,690
 He can make anything.  Just how the customer wants it. 

384
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:10,140
 But that's all old news now. 

385
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,450
 Right now, he owns the market at Mapo. 

386
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,290
 He's a man of great influence. 

387
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:23,280
 Even the officials in charge of vessel management and transportation, in front of Swindler Golsa, 

388
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,060
  are just mice in front of a cat. 

389
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,930
Without Swindler Golsa's permission, you can't even load a piece of chestnut.

390
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:39,400
In Mapo, at least, that bastard Golsa is king.

391
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,000
Then, if one catches Golsa, one could bend Lee In Jwa as well.

392
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,940
Of course.

393
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,600
For Lee In Jwa's money sources, the first one is from the chartered merchants.

394
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,530
The second is from Hong Mae's gambling place.

395
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:59,390
The third is from Swindler Golsa. And continuing the sources.

396
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,930
Let me speak also.

397
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:10,920
Swindler Golsa has a troublemaker kid who's being held

398
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,370
as White-Faced Scholar's hostage.

399
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,900
Swindler Golsa, who has a death grip on the the Mapo trade.

400
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,580
And Lee In Jwa who takes in half of those enormous earnings.

401
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,760
But all this was a transaction over his child who's being held hostage?

402
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,270
What if that hostage were to disappear?

403
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:35,670
Where would that hostage be?

404
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,280
 Attack them? We wouldn't need to do that. 

405
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,570
 Because we have you, Your Highness. 

406
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,750
Aigoo! I'm dying!

407
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,670
Aigoo! Save me!

408
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:56,240
Hey, elder! Are you okay?

409
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,720
- Stand up! Try standing up! 
 - Aigoo...

410
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,490
Go away.

411
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,390
Aigoo! Aigoo!

412
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:09,970
All of a sudden my eye and mouth are getting palsied!

413
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,150
Aigoo!

414
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,870
Why this elder...

415
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,600
 Do your best, Your Highness. 

416
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,400
Hey elder. Are you all right?

417
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,280
Pat the back of my neck for me.

418
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,600
Aigoo... I'm recovering now.

419
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,050
This happens to me once every two weeks.

420
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,940
Ah, that's right. Since I'm already here,

421
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,840
can I take a look around the gambling house?

422
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,550
I won again!

423
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,650
You want to become a gisaeng for Wol Ryang Restaurant?

424
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,010
Your face doesn't seem too bad.

425
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,480
So where were you before you came here?

426
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,320
I was a pretty popular gisaeng in Busan.

427
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,860
Okay.

428
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,870
Do you have any specialties?

429
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,690
 If it's not over here... 

430
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:18,260
You are quite skilled, but your physiognomy tells me you  have the fate of being a femme fatale.

431
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:19,880
Excuse me?

432
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,640
No, wait...

433
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:27,060
You're not just a femme fatale, but a baekhodaesal. 
 (bringer of terrible misfortune) 

434
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,150
Yes, you are a baekhodaesal.

435
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:35,580
In your young body, you hold a venomous and cruel spirit.

436
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,890
So anyone who comes in contact with you will have a hard time avoiding death.

437
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,130
What do you think?

438
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,630
Am I wrong?

439
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,930
Go back to where you came from.

440
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,580
The baekhodaesal...

441
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,810
is a terrible misfortune among misfortunes.

442
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,450
Shall I teach  you

443
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:40,000
a way for you to remove that terrible misfortune that is embedded in your body?

444
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,370
Who is it?

445
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,280
So you are acquainted with martial skills.

446
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:07,120
There is nothing in this room, so if you are a thief, leave at once.

447
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,840
It's double tens!

448
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,290
Where have you been all along,

449
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,590
my double tens?

450
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,830
What are you doing?

451
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:35,800
It's not like this is your first time striking a double ten, so what's with the big commotion?

452
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,390
What do you mean a "big commotion"?

453
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,960
Look over here, Hong Mae!

454
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,950
I'm just playing for the first time after so many years.

455
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,370
Aigoo, look at all this money!

456
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,890
Aigoo, pretty money! Aigoo, my cute money!

457
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:53,970
All right, I had a great time tonight!

458
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,290
Who are you?

459
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:11,320
Swindler Golsa. You know him?

460
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,750
I asked you a question first, so why are you replying back with a question?

461
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,420
Are you in there?

462
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,260
What's the matter?

463
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,870
I brought books that you said you wanted to read.

464
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,910
If there is anything bothering you, don't hesitate to let me know.

465
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,990
I have none.

466
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,600
Okay.

467
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,100
I'll save you, so let's escape here together.

468
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,580
Do you even know who I am?

469
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,600
You're Swindler Golsa's precious daughter.

470
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,730
You're not a normal one.

471
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,680
Since you could detect me with just my footsteps.

472
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,390
I don't know who you are,

473
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,020
but it seems we have a misunderstanding.

474
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:33,680
I am not here in Wol Ryang Restaurant as a hostage.

475
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:40,350
 If you do not want your father to die, 

476
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,440
 you'll need to behave well. 

477
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,310
As you can see, there isn't anyone watching over me,

478
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:55,790
so I can leave anytime I want.

479
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,480
So obviously I am not a hostage.

480
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,800
Then you won't care...

481
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,650
If I kill Swindler Golsa.

482
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:12,540
I'm sure you've heard the rumors about the destruction of the Ace of Sixes.

483
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,390
The person who destroyed the Ace of Sixes was me.

484
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,530
Baek Dae Gil.

485
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:35,480
You came?

486
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,140
Baek Man Geum's child.

487
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:00,940
â™¬  Longing for you even if the tears well up  â™¬

488
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:07,530
â™¬  I will withstand you. Even if my heart fills up more  â™¬

489
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:12,900
â™¬  Because the words which have not yet been said  remain  â™¬

490
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:20,000
â™¬  Because I cannot live a time without you  â™¬

491
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,400
â™¬  To you ...  â™¬
