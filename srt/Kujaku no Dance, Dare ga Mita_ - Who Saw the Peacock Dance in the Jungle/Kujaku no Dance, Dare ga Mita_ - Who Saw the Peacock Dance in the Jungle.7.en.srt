1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:05,905
On the night of Christmas Eve,

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,609
my father was murdered by someone.

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,312
The person arrested as the primary suspect

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,680
was Tomoya Endo.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,487
Tomoya was the son of Rikiro Endo,
a man who received the death penalty

6
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,790
for murdering a family
22 years ago in Higashikayama.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,396
However, my father left me a letter
that spoke of false accusations.

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,830
A pleasure to meet you.

9
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,732
I'm Narukawa.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,034
Why would you help us?

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,902
I think this Tomoya Endo kid…

12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,737
wasn't the one who did it.

13
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,839
Uta Hayashikawa…

14
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,174
Am I her?

15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,344
My father visited you here once, right?

16
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,380
Your father only
visited once to check on Uta.

17
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,017
Then, could you tell me
where Uta Hayashikawa is?

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,252
Look, this is Uta.

19
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,355
She's studying abroad
at a university in Singapore.

20
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,357
I knew it.

21
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,462
I'm not Uta Hayashikawa.

22
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,700
Let me tell you, Miss!

23
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,303
-You were amazing back there.
-I'm not so sure.

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,006
Women these days are really tough.

25
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,645
Well, Mr. Matsukaze would probably
call me reckless for acting this way.

26
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,115
That's because he's got
a duty to look after you.

27
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,519
I'm curious. What made you think
you were Uta Hayashikawa?

28
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,922
A reporter from Weekly Jidai told me.

29
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,192
That I might be Uta Hayashikawa.

30
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,795
What in the world?
What a bizarre thing to say.

31
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,899
I can't understand it myself,
no matter how much I think about it.

32
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,604
And now I know that
Uta Hayashikawa really does exist.

33
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,309
In that case, I've got a good idea.

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,320
Matsukaze, where's Mr. Kuze?

35
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,357
How did Mr. Akazawa know about my father?

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,163
-Hello?
-Mr. Matsukaze?

37
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,765
We just finished
our meeting with Mr. Tsujii.

38
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:17,070
It seems like it was true
that he took in Uta after the incident.

39
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,338
And guess what?

40
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:22,208
He said Uta's currently
studying abroad in Singapore.

41
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:27,046
So we now know for sure
that Miss and Uta aren't the same person.

42
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,715
I see.

43
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,784
Thanks for contacting me.
Will you be returning now?

44
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,685
No.

45
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,556
I'm planning to go and talk to that
reporter who keeps messing with Miss.

46
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,291
-What?
-What?

47
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,226
Don't you worry now.

48
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,695
I'll take care of Miss.

49
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,797
I'll call you when we're done.

50
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,399
-No, but--
-Bye then!

51
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,303
Is that really a good idea?

52
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,305
Wow, that's such a good one.

53
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,343
Attorney, wait a minute!

54
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,244
RAMEN

55
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,113
Mr. Someda,

56
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,849
did you really take your own life?

57
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,053
PROSECUTOR YUKI ANAN

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,023
A LINK TO THE HIGASHIKAYAMA INCIDENT

59
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,173
Didn't expect you to come
and see me yourself, Komugi.

60
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,376
Haven't had a surprise
like this since my birthday.

61
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:36,282
-What's this other surprise?
-Oh, pardon the late introduction.

62
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,953
I'm Narukawa, an attorney.

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,056
Wait, are you telling me
Mr. Matsukaze got…

64
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,857
No.

65
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,194
Mr. Narukawa is just
helping Mr. Matsukaze--

66
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,362
Well,

67
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,664
if Mr. Matsukaze is like Miss's father,

68
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,101
then you can think of me as his wife.

69
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,870
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

70
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,439
Miss?

71
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,176
Now, let's get to
the matter at hand, shall we?

72
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:08,581
Why do you think
this girl is Uta Hayashikawa?

73
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,185
Oh, you're here about that?

74
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,122
You're finally giving it
some serious thought?

75
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,158
Then I'll show you some evidence.

76
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,427
However…

77
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,531
Don't blame me for the consequences.

78
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,634
Since I'm not your caretaker.

79
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,603
Okay.

80
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,048
Feel free to zoom in.

81
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,254
Is this…

82
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,958
Miss's weight from when she was born?

83
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,894
Yes, it's Komugi's
child health record book.

84
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,765
Wait, why do you…

85
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,136
Was it at my house?

86
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,140
Mr. Yamashita's daughter?

87
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,079
Unfortunately, that was
the only treasure I found.

88
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,082
You trespassed on private property
and even took photos?

89
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,116
That's a crime!

90
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,686
Tell me, Komugi.

91
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,888
AWAYAMA MATERNITY HOSPITAL

92
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:26,559
Do the names Kyoichiro Awayama
and Manoka Takahata seem familiar to you?

93
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,397
Awayama…

94
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,500
KYOICHIRO AWAYAMA
MANOKA TAKAHATA

95
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,370
From Dad's letter!

96
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,539
Oh, excellent!

97
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,107
Cut the crap!

98
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,711
Stop it with the breadcrumbs.
Tell Miss everything you know!

99
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,579
Or else you won't die an easy death.

100
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,981
Hey, calm down. You're scaring me here.

101
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:54,620
Wait, going by your style of intimidation,
are you a former prosecutor?

102
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,056
I guess you changed jobs, huh?

103
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,461
Well, I guess old habits die hard.

104
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,531
Anyway, since you went through
the trouble of visiting me,

105
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,602
I'll give you the address of the place
where Awayama and Takahata live.

106
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,505
Write it down.

107
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,576
Also,

108
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,212
here's another present for you.

109
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,346
WEEKLY JIDAI

110
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,348
I recommend the article I wrote.

111
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,850
MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF RAMEN STALL OWNER

112
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,258
It was tough doing all the legwork,
so please gift me something back.

113
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,627
What?

114
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,365
Also, a final warning.

115
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,171
I can assure you that knowing
everything won't put you at ease.

116
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,279
All right then, best of luck.

117
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,214
Little Miss.

118
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,037
I'm still angry!

119
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,707
That Kamii is definitely
just playing around with me!

120
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,211
I'm also pissed at myself
for not being able to retort immediately!

121
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,180
Well, calm down first.

122
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,084
If Kamii is telling the truth,

123
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,122
Kyoichiro Awayama was the director
of the hospital where you were born,

124
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,925
and Manoka Takahata was the midwife.

125
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,295
But when I looked up
the address, it showed

126
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,299
an old-looking maternity hospital
that is no longer in business.

127
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,437
Who knows if we'll find these
Awayama and Takahata people here?

128
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:55,308
Still, maybe you could remember
something after seeing the place.

129
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,210
Right.

130
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,047
Hey.

131
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,951
I just wanted to let you know that

132
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,789
I'm not trying to learn
the truth just so I can be at ease.

133
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,527
I know.

134
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:24,103
I'm glad that you were free today.

135
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:30,910
Today's not really the type of day
that Mr. Narukawa is suited for.

136
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,847
I don't mean it in a bad way,
but just the trip there would tire me out.

137
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,315
-Really?
-What?

138
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,219
-Wait. Are you being serious?
-What?

139
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,823
I knew there was something off about you.

140
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,458
-Off how?
-Then consider this.

141
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:51,230
If you had to pick between going out with
Kamii or Mr. Narukawa, who would you pick?

142
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,132
What are you even asking? And why Kamii?

143
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,368
They're both exhausting in different ways.

144
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,804
I can't even imagine it.
That's a terrible question.

145
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,543
You've been driving for 90 minutes.
Would you like to take a break?

146
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,412
You heard the car, let's take a break.

147
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,747
I'll drive.

148
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,883
Your eyes are scaring me, so no.

149
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,554
This wasn't supposed to happen!

150
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,924
You said I wouldn't
have to worry about Uta.

151
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,261
Why are there people
snooping around after all this time?

152
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,232
The decision to not learn more
was made by you.

153
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,636
I chose not to tell you out of mercy.

154
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,872
What the heck does that mean?

155
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,411
I believe you know what became of Someda.

156
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,717
Do you want to follow
the same path as him?

157
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,890
LIST OF ASSETS

158
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,559
YASUNARI HAYASHIKAWA'S
ASSETS ARE LISTED HEREIN

159
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,376
What's wrong?

160
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,581
Nothing.

161
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:23,990
We finally made it.

162
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,942
So this is the place.

163
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,112
AWAYAMA MATERNITY HOSPITAL

164
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,046
What a good boy.

165
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,784
-What?
-Can we help you with something?

166
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,391
Excuse me.

167
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,694
My name is Komugi Yamashita.

168
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,133
I believe my father, Haruo Yamashita,
must have visited you in the past.

169
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,969
You're Komugi?

170
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,204
Yes.

171
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,342
What?

172
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,085
So you're Komugi.

173
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,188
Do you know me?

174
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,258
Know you? I was…

175
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,761
I can hardly recognize you.

176
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,167
-Well, I--
-Did Mr. Akazawa tell you?

177
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,235
What?

178
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,972
Did Mr. Akazawa tell you about this place?

179
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,677
What?

180
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,647
Here.

181
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,492
You've grown so much.

182
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,096
I guess…

183
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,264
I have.

184
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,102
Why did you come here?

185
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,270
My father,

186
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:24,176
Haruo Yamashita, left me a letter.

187
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,915
That letter had the names
Awayama and Takahata in it.

188
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,954
I was told that those names were
also in my child health record book.

189
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,925
I see.

190
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,761
If I may,

191
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,165
you mentioned Mr. Akazawa's name before.

192
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,067
How do you know him?

193
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,340
I know I mentioned his name
but I must apologize.

194
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,844
I can't answer that question.

195
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,746
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,548
May I ask why?

197
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:08,187
I don't have the right
to tell you everything.

198
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,956
Also,

199
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,627
if I did say it all, I'm sure…

200
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,365
it would end up hurting you.

201
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,947
All I want is to know the truth.

202
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,851
I just want to know.

203
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,289
But no one will tell me.

204
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,591
And without any rhyme or reason…

205
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,763
the people who do tell me…

206
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,236
go away.

207
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,847
But I still have to keep moving forward.

208
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,918
For those who are now gone, and also…

209
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,389
for myself.

210
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,094
So please…

211
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,367
Tell me.

212
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:46,385
I met Mr. Akazawa
around the same time I met you.

213
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,654
What?

214
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,690
Do you know a man named Tsujii?

215
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,626
Yes.

216
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,930
Wait, what about him?

217
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,667
What Mr. Akazawa did…

218
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,805
was protect Uta from Tsujii.

219
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,181
Chief.

220
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,618
Should we re-arrest Tomoya Endo or not?

221
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,720
A LINK TO THE HIGASHIKAYAMA INCIDENT

222
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,524
Chief Akazawa,

223
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,627
you were a part of the Higashikayama
investigation too, right?

224
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,933
Do you know what happened
to the child that survived that incident?

225
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,205
Chief?

226
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,124
What on earth?

227
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,160
-Check the second floor.
-Yes, sir.

228
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,134
Mr. Yamashita, Mr. Akazawa,
I found a survivor.

229
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,137
It's a child. Or rather, a baby.

230
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,973
Over here.

231
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,551
That child was

232
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,021
Uta Hayashikawa,
who was only half a year old.

233
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,025
As a parent myself,

234
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,262
I couldn't help
but be worried about her future.

235
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,932
Children…

236
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,768
bear no sins.

237
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,473
-Yamashita. Akazawa.
-Yes, sir.

238
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,410
HIGASHIKAYAMA ROBBERY-MURDER CASE

239
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,445
Bring Tsujii in for questioning.

240
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,883
By Tsujii, do you mean Yasunari's cousin?

241
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,087
Exactly. He's the one who benefits
most from Yasunari's inheritance.

242
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,992
It's not unlikely for him
to be connected with Rikiro Endo.

243
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,295
Understood.

244
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,970
Can we get this over with quickly?

245
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,940
I'm going to get really busy
with starting a new life.

246
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,942
A new life?

247
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,746
A new life as Uta's foster father.

248
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,749
I've got so many media offers.

249
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,521
One of them is about filming
a documentary of Uta's growth.

250
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,657
Depicting the story
of the lone survivor of a tragic incident

251
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,561
being raised and cared for by yours truly.

252
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,129
Or so it'll go.

253
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,199
They're offering me
a lot of money, you see.

254
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,202
The climax will be
when Uta learns about the incident--

255
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,071
-You!
-Akazawa!

256
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,340
You don't deserve to be anyone's parent!

257
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,810
Now look here.

258
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,847
Do you think Uta can live her life
blissfully ignorant about that incident?

259
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,851
Get real. And stop with the preaching.

260
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,556
Or what, do you two plan
to look after Uta forever?

261
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,157
Well?

262
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,963
HANAGAOKA CHILDREN'S HOME

263
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,034
I told you!

264
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,736
You have to follow procedure
even if you're a relative--

265
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,940
I already showed you
my driving license to confirm my identity!

266
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,541
I'm Uta's relative!

267
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,944
-The name's Tsujii!
-Please keep your voice low!

268
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,246
Excuse me! Police.

269
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,917
Mr. Tsujii, I'll have
to ask you to accompany us.

270
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,861
That man suddenly barged in here
with people from a TV station.

271
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,163
They started filming without permission.

272
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,235
And then he suddenly caused a ruckus,
saying he was going to take Uta with him.

273
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,303
At this rate,

274
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,274
that man named Tsujii will be
the person to take her in, right?

275
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,012
Is there anything
that you could do about it?

276
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,954
I'd like to.

277
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,958
But unfortunately,

278
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,862
this is beyond our control.

279
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,684
-You okay?
-What?

280
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,853
Oh, I'm fine.

281
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,259
Aren't hands just amazing?

282
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,328
What's gotten into you?

283
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,301
Whether you do good things or bad things,

284
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,871
they both start from these.

285
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:14,546
They can also let you feel warmth.

286
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,950
They're just amazing.

287
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,756
You want one?

288
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,660
Oh, I'm good.

289
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,196
I'm quitting.

290
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,905
The two of us back then

291
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,543
didn't want to see a child suffer
due to the whims of adults.

292
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,748
That's all it was.

293
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,391
Mr. Akazawa isn't just any police officer.

294
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,892
Not to me, at least.

295
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:08,267
It wouldn't be an exaggeration
to say he was like a second father to Uta.

296
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,846
And?

297
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,550
What happened next?

298
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,827
Tell me what happened next.

299
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,566
You don't have to force yourself, okay?

300
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,604
I want to know.

301
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,710
I already…

302
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,681
understand.

303
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:05,457
I am not… Komugi Yamashita.

304
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,897
Please, tell me what happened next.

305
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,905
One day,

306
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,742
Mr. Akazawa came here
with a grave expression on his face.

307
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,144
Then,

308
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:32,551
he asked me to forge
Uta's birth certificate.

309
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,522
I accepted his request.

310
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,326
And that's how…

311
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:47,733
you became a member
of the Yamashita family.

312
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,194
This is footage of that moment.

313
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,541
Well? Is it working now?

314
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,247
-I wonder what she'll be like.
-What?

315
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,316
I'm getting nervous now.

316
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,088
-Are you all right?
-I'm not!

317
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,895
-What do I do? Will it be okay?
-You'll be fine.

318
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,897
Are you sure?

319
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,135
Come in!

320
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,806
-I'm coming in!
-What do I do?

321
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,811
I'm so nervous.

322
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,679
-Hello.
-Welcome!

323
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,713
Thanks for coming.

324
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,016
-It's nice to see you.
-Hello.

325
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,518
Wow, she's so small!

326
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,554
And so cute!

327
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,456
This is Uta.

328
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,358
Here.

329
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,229
-Is she heavy?
-Oh, she is heavy!

330
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,435
-She's so cute!
-Look, it's Mommy.

331
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,506
It's nice to meet you.

332
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,279
Look at her, Haru.

333
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:45,217
Look, say hi to Daddy.

334
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,887
Mr. Yamashita, I'll hold that.

335
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,765
-It's Daddy.
-Come on, Mr. Yamashita.

336
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,236
Hello.

337
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,973
She's so adorable.

338
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,109
Thank you for coming to us.

339
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,281
From today, your name is Komugi.

340
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,251
Hello, my sweetie.

341
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:26,091
We'll make a ton of memories
together as a family.

342
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,963
Don't you want to hold her?

343
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,931
Wait, me?

344
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,866
-Mr. Yamashita.
-You want to hold her?

345
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,603
Here.

346
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,907
-Is that okay? Really?
-You're good.

347
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,749
Hi, Komugi.

348
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:52,918
Yes?

349
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,022
-Hello.
-Hello, sweetie.

350
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,367
Oh, are you hungry?

351
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,636
Oh, you are? Okay then.

352
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,182
Please accept my apology, Komugi.

353
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,252
I'm really sorry!

354
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,926
Mr. Yamashita told me that

355
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,665
someday he wanted to show you
this video of you joining the family,

356
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,301
but he couldn't keep it at his house.

357
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,106
That's why he left this camera with us.

358
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:54,546
We had decided to show you
the video if you ever came here,

359
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,654
but both my wife and I thought
that this day would never come.

360
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:08,693
Because if you had come here,
it would mean you had learned everything.

361
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,934
But because you did come here,

362
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,738
I was able to show you this.

363
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,974
Mr. Yamashita genuinely wished…

364
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,078
to show this to you.

365
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,349
I've finally fulfilled…

366
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,253
his request.

367
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,539
Komugi!

368
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,043
Excuse me.

369
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,384
Mr. Matsukaze,

370
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,287
what do I do?

371
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,524
I feel like I'm about to regret…

372
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,964
knowing all this.

373
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,414
Thank you.

374
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,418
I feel… a lot better now.

375
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,489
I've only seen them in the video,
but your mom and dad

376
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,824
both seemed very kind.

377
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,530
Mom was really scary when she got mad.

378
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,798
Really?

379
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,703
One time, I stayed up late to
play games and she yelled at me.

380
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,037
Really?

381
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,745
Dad, on the other hand,
was very soft on me.

382
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,449
I'd always ask him first
if there was anything I wanted.

383
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,583
Really?

384
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,755
Look, I get it.

385
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,691
It's not that I'm disinterested.
It's just a habit.

386
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,228
-That sounds like an excuse.
-I get it.

387
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,997
-Stop saying that.
-Look, I--

388
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,101
It's cold, so let's go back.

389
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,070
-It'll get weird if we keep talking.
-What?

390
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,141
What?

391
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,812
Nothing.

392
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,648
-Are you angry?
-No, I am not.

393
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,320
Komugi!

394
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,059
Please,

395
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,330
don't take him to the police.

396
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,099
I'm sorry.

397
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,836
You have every right to refuse.

398
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,571
But I swear to you

399
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,575
that Awayama did what he did
because he cared about you.

400
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,177
I promise you.

401
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,753
I'm so sorry, Komugi.

402
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:05,063
The one who rewrote the entries
in your child health record book

403
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,398
was me.

404
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,571
Mr. Akazawa and I were on the same page

405
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,708
about wanting a happy life
for the child above all else.

406
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:24,048
But Mr. Haruo was conflicted
until the very last moment.

407
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,585
He gave more thought than anyone

408
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,722
to what kind of life
you were going to lead.

409
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,658
Today,

410
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:41,366
I felt relieved after seeing you
all grown up and healthy.

411
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,738
I'm now certain that
what I did wasn't a mistake.

412
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,175
Komugi.

413
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,280
Yes?

414
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,617
You are, and always will be,

415
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,890
the greatest treasure
Mr. Haruo and Ms. Shizuka ever had.

416
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,578
-Hey.
-Yes?

417
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,481
Could you give me
a little more of your time?

418
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,921
I might be misremembering, but I'd like
to go someplace and check something.

419
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,625
I want to see if their menu
has cream soda on it.

420
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,460
Right, cream… Wait, what?

421
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,933
Welcome, please take a seat
wherever you like.

422
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,775
Oh, they have it. Cream soda.

423
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:03,581
I think I drank this once
as a reward for getting an injection.

424
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,017
I'm surprised you remember that.

425
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:12,590
I guess that means
I really am Uta Hayashikawa.

426
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,197
Here you go.

427
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:23,101
Please call me
when you've decided on your order.

428
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,075
Maybe I'll get some omelet rice.

429
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,115
I'm good. I doubt you can
finish it on your own.

430
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,050
Welcome!

431
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,119
I totally can.

432
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,755
There, there. You're fine.

433
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,923
Who's a good baby?

434
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,861
You are. Oh, yes, you are.

435
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,097
It's all right.

436
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:57,035
-Here, look.
-You're just fine.

437
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,870
It must be nice.

438
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,809
I wonder why I felt that way.

439
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,579
I must have been treated the same way.

440
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,384
From today, your name is Komugi.

441
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,255
We'll make a ton of memories
together as a family.

442
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,191
It's okay. We're family.

443
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,962
I know that I was loved.

444
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,834
Is it because both of them died
without ever telling me?

445
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,337
Since you don't have
any Yamashita blood in you,

446
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,773
I'll be looking after Haruo's money.

447
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:40,144
I betrayed Mr. Yamashita.

448
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:47,251
Knowing everything won't put you at ease.

449
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,089
That's not it.

450
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,991
I don't feel envious.

451
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,895
I feel bitter.

452
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,754
There, there. You'll be fine.

453
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,192
There, there.

454
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,961
Right?

455
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,199
There, there. It's all okay.

456
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,411
Hey, Mr. Matsukaze.

457
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,350
Thank you for coming with me today.

458
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,418
It's fine.

459
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,356
If you hadn't come with me,

460
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,462
I couldn't have finished the rice.

461
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,130
-That's why?
-Just kidding.

462
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,739
I still haven't
fully processed everything yet.

463
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,342
But I'm glad I went.

464
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,879
Thanks to today,

465
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,983
I think I can be glad…

466
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,856
that Mom and Dad were my mom and dad.

467
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,694
I genuinely feel that way.

468
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,046
-Arisa.
-Mugi.

469
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,480
Sorry about this.

470
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,852
Nice to meet you.
I'm Matsukaze, an attorney.

471
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,022
He's helping me out
with my dad's affairs and stuff.

472
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,458
I'm Arisa, Mugi's friend from university.

473
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,494
Please look after her for tonight.

474
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,762
Leave it to me.

475
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,368
Thank you for today.

476
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,905
-Good night.
-Good night to you too.

477
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,674
Let's go.

478
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,711
Aren't hands just amazing?

479
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,749
Whether you do good things or bad things,

480
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,852
they both start from these.

481
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:16,294
They can also let you feel warmth.

482
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,031
They're just amazing.

483
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,149
Yes? Akazawa speaking.

484
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,057
There we go.

485
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,393
Coming.

486
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,563
Who could it be?

487
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,766
TADASHI AKAZAWA
I'LL BE LATE TODAY. SORRY

488
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,637
I'm home.

489
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,906
Welcome back.

490
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,911
I'm an adult.
You don't have to do this every year.

491
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,047
You may be an adult,
but you're still a child to me.

492
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,383
You're not wrong there.

493
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,087
-Thanks.
-Dad says he'll be late.

494
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,989
-Let's eat first.
-Got it.

495
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,959
Here, look.

496
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,462
-Wow, that cake looks great.
-Right?

497
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,832
-Where did you get it?
-I made it myself.

498
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:28,933
Wow!

499
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,571
So everything that reporter said
was actually true?

500
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,673
That's sickening.

501
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,274
Is Komugi all right?

502
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,479
She's still processing it.
It was a pretty big shock to her.

503
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,980
I left her with a friend.

504
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,418
I see. At least she's not alone.

505
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:51,655
True, but then who was the person
in the photo that idiot Tsujii showed us?

506
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,226
Well, we'd have to ask
Tsujii himself to know that.

507
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:59,130
But he must've prepared it in advance.
It's not exactly hard to fake photos.

508
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,166
Mr. Awayama's story
seems to check out too.

509
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,703
I'm surprised by that Akazawa fellow too.

510
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,572
To think he got
Miss's birth certificate forged.

511
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,909
I'm willing to bet
he's messed with other stuff too.

512
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,347
By the way, what about that video
you said you and Komugi saw?

513
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,350
I'll go and talk to them again,
so I'll get it then.

514
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,319
Anyway, as Mr. Narukawa says,

515
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:26,123
there's a chance that
Mr. Akazawa is still hiding something.

516
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,960
I'll talk to him first thing tomorrow.
For both Komugi's and Tomoya's sake too.

517
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:35,199
Yes, but Akazawa's trying to set
Tomoya up as Haruo's killer.

518
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,136
Would he really be willing to talk
to Tomoya's defense counsel?

519
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,772
He looked into your father too, didn't he?

520
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:43,974
Yes, but…

521
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:48,512
I could get in touch with my contacts
and have them gather information.

522
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,581
That's our best plan. How about it?

523
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,619
I guess so. Can I count on you then?

524
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,089
-I have Tomoya to worry about.
-Leave it to me.

525
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,612
Wow, she's so small!

526
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,414
And so cute!

527
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,119
This is Uta.

528
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,725
-Here, she's heavy.
-Oh, she is heavy.

529
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,629
Look, it's Mommy.

530
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,334
It's nice to meet you.

531
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,176
Look at her, Haru.

532
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:53,944
She's smiling.

533
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,714
Here.

534
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,183
Look, it's Daddy.

535
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,586
Mr. Yamashita, I'll hold that.

536
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,459
Hello.

538
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,416
I'm sorry for calling you all of a sudden.

539
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:45,062
I told Komugi everything
and showed her the video.

540
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,103
I know that this could
cause problems for you.

541
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,540
I'm really sorry about that.

542
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,981
Both Mr. Yamashita and you

543
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,787
are just too good for your own sake.

544
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,996
-Delivery for you, Mr. Kamii.
-Thanks.

545
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,598
-Mr. Uesugi.
-Yes?

546
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,299
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks.

548
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,791
Miss could be in danger!

549
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,293
-A coincidence.
-Mr. Yamashita said something strange.

550
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,228
The last person that holds the key.

551
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,530
I have an idea.

552
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,932
They're still hiding something.
