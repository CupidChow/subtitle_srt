1
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:46,579
People cannot know
what lies in the hearts of others.

2
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:55,488
Even those closest to you, those you love.

3
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,224
They still keep secrets.

4
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,596
Will I be able to reach it?

5
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,668
That place hidden deep in the forest.

6
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:14,874
The glimmer of light you stored there.

7
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,687
A growling stomach
just proves you're alive.

8
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,923
You always say that.

9
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,857
Here you go.

10
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,594
Thanks. Oh, it's hot.

11
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,962
Thank you.

12
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,030
Thanks for the meal.

13
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,698
Thanks for the meal.

14
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,869
Oh, that's good.

15
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,719
I used to think that
once you were old enough to marry,

16
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,623
I wouldn't get to eat here
with you anymore.

17
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,524
What?

18
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,494
Does 21 count as old enough to marry?

19
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,063
Passed your prime, huh?

20
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,431
What's with that?

21
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,199
But, still,

22
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,403
thanks for tagging along with me
even though it's Christmas.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,908
I get restless if I don't eat the ramen
here at least once a week.

24
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,278
It just happened to be Christmas Eve.

25
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,285
But, well,

26
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,523
ramen tastes extra good
when I eat it with you, Dad.

27
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,597
Same here.

28
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,169
What's with the face?

29
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,970
No, it's just, well…

30
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:54,474
What do you want?
You know, as a Christmas present?

31
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,409
You're not supposed to ask.

32
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,445
Present?

33
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,413
Yes.

34
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,251
I want those.

35
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,252
What?

36
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,254
Words of gratitude.

37
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,756
What?

38
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,759
I do a lot of chores
around the house, you know.

39
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,294
All while doing my studies.

40
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,663
And who wakes you up every morning?

41
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,999
In any case, I think I've earned
a few words of gratitude.

42
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,438
You're right.

43
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,347
Here.

44
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,515
Wipe your snot.

45
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,449
I'm good.

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,350
Blow your nose.

47
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,053
-I don't need it!
-It's okay. We're family.

48
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,688
What's with that?

49
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,427
Didn't you have a drinking party
with your friends?

50
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,861
Crap.

51
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,764
-Bye then.
-Contact me when you're done, okay?

52
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll come and pick you up.
I'll wait at the station.

53
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,635
Overprotective much?

54
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,870
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure thing, Komugi.

55
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,672
-Take care, okay?
-See you later.

56
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,312
Where to next?

57
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,481
-I want to eat some noodles!
-Sounds good!

58
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,884
-Let's get some ramen!
-I'm in.

59
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,286
Want to go for karaoke?

60
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:15,722
Mugi?

61
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:16,723
Mugi.

62
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,658
Are you really going?

63
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,294
Yes, sorry.
My dad is coming to pick me up.

64
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,263
Oh, that sucks.

65
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,731
Be careful, okay?

66
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,366
Later then.

67
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,601
-Later.
-Bye-bye.

68
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,253
TOBU STORE

69
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,258
You're late!

70
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,162
DAD
NO ANSWER

71
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,398
DID YOU FALL ASLEEP?

72
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,404
I'LL WALK HOME!
SORRY IF YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY!

73
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,210
It's burning like crazy.

74
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,315
-Are the people inside all right?
-The fire has fully developed!

75
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:54,654
The firefighters will try to control
the fire and prevent it from spreading!

76
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,859
-The rescue team will…
-Please keep your distance!

77
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,832
Dad…

78
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,691
It must have been tough for you, Komugi.

79
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,826
Tell us if you ever need help.

80
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,128
Komugi.

81
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,298
Mr. Akazawa made time to come
despite being busy with the investigation.

82
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,868
-Mrs. Akazawa is here too.
-Komugi…

83
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,638
I'm very sorry for your loss.

84
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,277
I don't know what to say…

85
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,612
Ms. Kyoko.

86
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,448
Mr. Yamashita did a lot for me and Kyoko.

87
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,655
I'm sure my father owed a lot to you
as well when he was alive.

88
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,790
Not at all.

89
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,093
Remember to thank him, Komugi.

90
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,397
It's thanks to his efforts
that the culprit was caught so soon.

91
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,234
Thank you so much.

92
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,637
He's still only a suspect.

93
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,639
At least offer your farewell to him.

94
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,607
Here, come inside.

95
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,578
But still…

96
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,846
I'm shocked

97
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,116
that it was the son of the culprit
behind the Higashikayama case.

98
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,284
Yes.

99
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,387
Mr. Yamashita and I arrested
the culprit behind that incident.

100
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,422
Did he want revenge for his father?

101
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,424
We can't say just yet.

102
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,394
Komugi.

103
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,032
I'm sure it's tough,
but you'll have to move forward.

104
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,168
This is the time to cry
as much as you need.

105
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,938
Crying…

106
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,342
won't bring my father back to life.

107
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,645
And also,

108
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,449
whether I move forward or not…

109
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,220
is for me to decide.

110
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,223
Okay.

111
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,065
What is it like,
living on your own for the first time?

112
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,601
The paperwork is tedious.

113
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,869
And your university?

114
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,306
I'm planning to go back next week.

115
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,515
Listen. I have to tell you
about Haruo's insurance payout.

116
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:40,720
I'll manage your money for a little while.

117
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,488
Temporarily, of course.

118
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,526
If you let me handle it,
you can focus on your studies.

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,428
Right? What do you say?

120
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,433
Okay.

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,435
It's decided then.

122
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,339
Don't you worry. We're family.

123
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,976
-I don't need it!
-It's okay. We're family.

124
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,011
What's with that?

125
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,314
Okay, Komugi?

126
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,454
Yes.

127
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,744
I should have saved more.

128
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,249
I'm shocked

129
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,720
that it was the son of the culprit
behind the Higashikayama case.

130
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,160
FEATURED ARTICLES

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,897
On the 24th of last month,
Haruo Yamashita, a former policeman,

132
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,634
lost his life in an arson incident
in Higashikayama, Adachi City.

133
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:06,072
An unemployed man named Tomoya Endo
has been arrested as the primary suspect.

134
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,575
The police say he is the only son

135
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,045
of the death row inmate, Rikiro Endo,
who received the death penalty

136
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,850
for murdering a family of six
in Higashikayama 22 years ago.

137
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:22,722
The police will continue to investigate
any other links to the Higashikayama case.

138
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,458
The Higashikayama case…

139
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,231
HIGASHIKAYAMA CASE

140
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,234
He worked on this case?

141
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,837
Dad…

142
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,923
Don't cry!

143
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,662
Don't cry.

144
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,097
Don't cry.

145
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,092
SATURDAY, JANUARY FOURTH

146
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:59,218
Proof that I'm alive, huh?

147
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,056
RAMEN

148
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,461
Welcome!

149
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,240
Thank you for the meal.

150
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,166
Sorry for coming in at a weird time.

151
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,269
Oh, not at all.
It's the perfect time, actually.

152
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,139
I have something
I need to hand over to you.

153
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:58,811
That night, Mr. Yamashita left an envelope
with me after he finished eating.

154
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,285
Here.

155
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:18,898
What the…

156
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,401
You didn't know what was inside?

157
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,969
No.

158
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,640
TO KOMUGI

159
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,319
TO KOMUGI
I'M SURE THE MONEY MUST HAVE SHOCKED YOU

160
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:46,992
To tell the truth, I was very conflicted
on whether to write this letter or not.

161
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,932
If I didn't write it,
you would probably be able to stay happy.

162
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:59,672
However, if the worst case
I can think of comes to pass…

163
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,975
"That is to say,

164
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,913
if I am murdered by someone…"

165
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,451
Should any of the people listed
below happen to be arrested.

166
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,321
Tatsuo Mikita.

167
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,223
Kouta Tsujii.

168
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,592
Tomoya Endo.

169
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,962
Tomoya…

170
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,563
SUSPECT ARRESTED
TOMOYA ENDO (34)

171
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,165
…Endo?

172
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,670
"That person has been…

173
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,009
falsely accused."

174
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,310
FALSELY ACCUSED

175
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,495
Thanks for the food.

176
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,745
Yes?

177
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,650
You're Mr. Matsukaze, right?

178
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,184
I am.

179
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,564
"If one of the people I've named
ends up being arrested,

180
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:36,635
go to the attorney I've named
and ask for their services.

181
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,838
The enclosed three million yen
should cover the charges."

182
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,307
YOSHITERU MATSUKAZE

183
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,274
What?

184
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,811
How did you know my father?

185
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,348
Well, I've honestly never
even heard his name.

186
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,684
So creepy. How did he know about me?

187
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,584
What?

188
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,688
Then… why?

189
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,723
That's what I'd like to ask.

190
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,794
Just to be clear,
are you certain your father wrote this?

191
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,029
Yes, it was definitely him,

192
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,932
I think.

193
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,268
You think, huh?

194
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,104
What about it?

195
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,138
Nothing.

196
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,041
Just that you're only
as sure as an "I think."

197
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,609
So you're not fully certain.

198
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,111
I'm fully certain!

199
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,647
Hey, you can't just do that.
No retroactive certainty.

200
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,216
Retroactive what now?
I've never heard that before.

201
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,751
And I've never said it before.

202
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,790
-Okay, so roughly summarizing--
-Don't summarize it "roughly!"

203
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,660
Okay, summarizing precisely then.

204
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,128
You'll cover the attorney fees,

205
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,398
so you want me to defend people
who might become suspects?

206
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,904
I want you to defend
a person called Tomoya Endo.

207
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,808
Would you do it, Attorney Matsukaze?

208
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,817
Just hold on a minute.

209
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:03,622
Before anything, do you actually think
this Tomoya Endo has been falsely accused?

210
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,328
Honestly…

211
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,733
-I'm not sure.
-Wow.

212
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,304
-What?
-To be clear, I meant that in a bad way.

213
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,780
I decline.

214
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,415
But why?

215
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,684
Assuming Tomoya Endo did do it, what then?

216
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,588
You want to hire and pay me to help
a man who might have killed your father.

217
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,291
From the outside,
your behavior is highly unusual.

218
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,026
Hence, "creepy."

219
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,928
I'm led to suspect an ulterior motive.

220
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,329
It's a low possibility,

221
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,533
but please don't tell me
you want me to be his attorney

222
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,369
so you can get me to do
a poor job of representing him.

223
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,405
I have no idea
why you're doing any of this,

224
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,607
so might I suggest you take a long rest?

225
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,777
That ran a bit long,
but that's all from me.

226
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,346
So you think what my father wrote

227
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,216
was a lie?

228
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,384
Did you even listen?

229
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,519
-I didn't say that.
-I've heard enough.

230
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,893
You know what?
Right now, I'm angry at myself.

231
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:21,266
Angry at myself
for calling you "Attorney" even once.

232
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,808
Who cares what you call me?

233
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,482
-I heard the last bit.
-Don't come out all excited like that.

234
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,751
-"Retroactive certainty"?
-Heard it from the start, did you?

235
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,020
I wonder how he knew about you.

236
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,922
It's not like you're someone

237
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,825
with an impeccable record
on high-profile cases.

238
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,760
And yet he named you in a letter.

239
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,162
How weird.

240
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,098
You sure about turning her down?

241
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,902
That letter was just way too fishy.

242
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,304
But didn't you say this back then?

243
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,375
"Even if it doesn't turn out to be
the optimal choice when looking back,

244
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,645
it's much better
than pretending not to see."

245
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,481
Isaid that? When?

246
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,049
You did.

247
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,217
-Hello.
-Hello there.

248
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,220
Anyway, stay cool.

249
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,925
Why did it have to be me?

250
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,093
Sorry for the wait.

251
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,661
Thank you.

252
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,733
You okay?

253
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,137
You must be tired.
Sorry for making you come all this way.

254
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,138
It's okay.

255
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,274
Mr. Akazawa,

256
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,809
you said at the funeral

257
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,746
that you arrested the culprit
behind the Higashikayama case

258
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,080
alongside my father.

259
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:48,353
Why was my father targeted now,
22 years after it happened?

260
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,991
You already know that Tomoya Endo
is maintaining his silence, right?

261
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,560
Yes.

262
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,399
Please don't share
the following information with anyone.

263
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,135
Part of it is my own speculation.

264
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,775
On July 7th, 2002,

265
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,513
we received a report that an entire family
had been murdered by someone

266
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,683
inside a single room
in the residential area of Higashikayama.

267
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,720
The six members of the Hayashikawa family
had their limbs tied up

268
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,223
and were hanged on a spiral staircase.

269
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,459
The second daughter of the family
was six months old,

270
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,295
and miraculously survived
as she was in a different room.

271
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:36,134
Rikiro Endo, 40 years old at the time,
was the one arrested for the murders.

272
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,973
He lived in the same area as the victims
and was the first person on the scene.

273
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,975
The reason for his arrest

274
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,612
was that he knew information
only the killer could have known.

275
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,381
His own statements implicated him.

276
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:54,586
After his arrest, his son, Tomoya,
was placed in a foster home.

277
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:59,224
His mother had left when he was little
and he had no other relatives to rely on.

278
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,095
Apparently, he was subjected
to severe bullying at the foster home.

279
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,297
Perhaps as a result of it,

280
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,735
he tried to set fire to the foster home,
and caused a small fire.

281
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,505
After he left the foster home,
he got employment,

282
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,474
but it seems he couldn't quite fit in.

283
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:21,346
His second case of arson
was setting fire to his boss' house.

284
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,349
Thankfully, no one was harmed.

285
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,920
He had been serving his prison sentence
until he was discharged just recently.

286
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,558
It's a common story with criminals,

287
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,696
but their perception often gets twisted
in an effort to justify themselves.

288
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,465
Their perception gets twisted?

289
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,503
Normally, one would think
it was because of his father's crime

290
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,539
that he had to go through
some terrible experiences.

291
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,374
In Tomoya's case…

292
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,609
ENDO RECEIVES DEATH PENALTY

293
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,713
…for whatever reason, he thinks the police
framed his father and blamed them instead.

294
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,250
As a result, he saw Mr. Yamashita,
who led the investigation,

295
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,152
as a target for his rage.

296
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,957
His father, Rikiro,
was arrested right on Christmas Eve.

297
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,161
I'm certain he picked
the same day on purpose.

298
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:13,398
He must have been planning
his revenge right after being released.

299
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,401
What if…

300
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,340
What if he's staying silent

301
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,010
because he didn't do it?

302
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,281
No.

303
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,617
He's definitely the one who did it.

304
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,922
Even if he doesn't confess,
we have evidence for the prosecution.

305
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,290
Evidence?

306
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,328
At the time of the crime, we had him
on CCTV footage near the crime scene.

307
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,731
Rest at ease.

308
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,934
The chances of him being proven innocent

309
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,137
are next to none.

310
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,043
HIGASHIKAYAMA POLICE STATION

311
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,642
I ended up coming after all.

312
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,597
This is who I am.

313
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,768
A certain someone told me
to come and meet you.

314
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,442
I'll get to the point.

315
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:08,447
I have some questions to ask you
about the murder of Haruo Yamashita.

316
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,604
Dad…

317
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,742
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

318
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:41,980
Komugi.

319
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:48,353
I want you to know
that Dad is on your side.

320
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,990
You can take your time.

321
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:57,095
Can you tell me what happened?

322
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,763
Please?

323
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,534
It's okay.

324
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:04,769
Please?

325
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:10,242
This morning, Emi brought
a scarf that her mom had given her.

326
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,144
We were all saying how nice it was.

327
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,315
But after the lunch break,

328
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,352
the scarf was all cut up.

329
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,356
It was in tatters.

330
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,427
And then
they said I was the one who did it.

331
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,500
They said it's because I don't have a mom.

332
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:49,014
I trust you, Komugi.

333
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,185
It must have hurt to have
everyone doubt you.

334
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,421
But know this.

335
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,456
The person who cut up the scarf

336
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:03,395
might be thinking
they managed to get away with it.

337
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,597
Get away?

338
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:10,902
Someday,
that person will have to face the fact

339
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,173
that they were the one
who cut up the scarf.

340
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,911
There's a saying that goes,

341
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:24,316
"Who saw the peacock dance in the jungle?"

342
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,429
Hey! Hold it!

343
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,564
That would be illegal dumping.

344
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,500
It's punishable
by up to five years in prison,

345
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,803
or a maximum fine
of one million yen, or both.

346
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,006
That's way too strict.

347
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,976
I went to meet Tomoya Endo.

348
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,612
What? Why?

349
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,146
I thought about it.

350
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,350
About whether you forged
the letter yourself--

351
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,151
-I didn't!
-Let me finish.

352
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:04,556
I thought about what you could stand
to gain if you did, in my own way.

353
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,458
To conclude,

354
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,261
it was all very unconvincing.

355
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,732
Not a single explanation
was able to satisfy me,

356
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,868
which is why I decided
to go and talk to Tomoya Endo.

357
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,444
I don't know what
I'm supposed to believe anymore.

358
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,148
Mr. Akazawa from the police said

359
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,152
that Tomoya Endo was definitely
the person who killed my father.

360
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,322
That's the normal conclusion.

361
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,891
And it's not like the police would lie.

362
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,364
The police tell lies too.

363
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,105
I still want to believe
what my father said.

364
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,247
Do you know the saying,
"Who saw the peacock dance in the jungle?"

365
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,049
What?

366
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:08,553
My father told me
about it a long time ago.

367
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:14,359
If there was no one around
to see a peacock dance in a jungle,

368
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:19,097
would it be the same
as if it never happened?

369
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,701
The only one that knew
the truth would be the peacock.

370
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,640
Even if the peacock lied to itself,

371
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,610
it could never escape
the fact that it danced.

372
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,818
When I think about it now,
maybe those words from my father

373
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,822
were directed partly at himself.

374
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,096
I don't know why my father
wrote down your name.

375
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:57,736
But right now, all I can do

376
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,407
is confront what was written
in my father's letter.

377
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:07,979
That's why…

378
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,318
Would you accept my request?

379
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,553
He said something, you see.

380
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,424
So you won't answer, no matter what I ask?

381
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,394
Could you at least tell me
why you're remaining silent?

382
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,300
The only one who knows…

383
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,871
is the peacock.

384
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,273
What?

385
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,676
I can't really say what he meant by that.

386
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,212
Maybe he just happened
to know the same story.

387
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,450
Can I ask you something
that has been bugging me all this time?

388
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,552
How can you believe that letter?

389
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,587
From A to Z.

390
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:55,860
I just can't figure out
where that faith of yours comes from.

391
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,063
Because my father wrote it.

392
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,401
He has been with me forever,

393
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,371
and he left me that letter.

394
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,110
My father trusted me.

395
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,415
That's why I trust him.

396
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,630
All I can do is what's within my power
as a defense attorney.

397
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,866
Nothing more and nothing less.

398
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,871
I accept it. Your request.

399
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,612
I'll help you find out
whether the peacock danced or not.

400
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,683
I'll accompany you to the jungle.

401
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,287
I will be…

402
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,190
your eyes.

403
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,361
What does that mean?

404
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,963
-Scratch that.
-Be my eyes?

405
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,164
-I said nothing.
-Stop.

406
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,266
So persistent! What are you? A prosecutor?

407
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,313
I'm home.

408
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,168
It's still here.

409
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,340
ADACHI YOTSUBA KINDERGARTEN
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

410
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,646
ADACHI YOTSUBA KINDERGARTEN
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

411
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,234
I ENJOYED MY BATH.
THANK YOU, KOMUGI! FROM DAD

412
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,535
I knew it.

413
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,472
It's his handwriting.

414
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,619
Mr. Yamashita's daughter?

415
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,388
What?

416
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,459
I'm a reporter for a magazine
called Weekly Jidai.

417
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,661
The name is Kamii. Your father--

418
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,736
At least let me finish.

419
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,214
GREEN TEA

420
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,323
Got it.

421
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,392
I'll send someone over there.

422
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,361
Are you somewhere safe right now?

423
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,030
Yes.

424
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,965
I'm fine.

425
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,767
That's good.

426
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,837
Tell me, Komugi.

427
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,206
Yes?

428
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,943
Why did you go there?

429
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,113
I just…

430
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,981
Yes?

431
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,586
I wanted to see if there were
any pictures of my father.

432
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,155
I see.

433
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,125
Anyway, call me immediately
if anything happens.

434
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,026
Okay.

435
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,065
KAMII FROM JIDAI

436
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,703
Kamii.

437
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,178
I'm his partner at this office.
My name is Hasami.

438
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm an attorney, same as Teru.

439
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,848
Teru?

440
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,850
We've been buds since grade school.

441
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,752
It's nice to meet you, Attorney Hasami.

442
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,687
Oh, please, drop the title.

443
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,157
No need to be so formal.
Just call me Hassa.

444
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,160
Call me Hassa, yes? Anyway, stay cool.

445
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,594
What?

446
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,030
It means, "Don't do anything lame."

447
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,599
But the one right now
was more like, "Stay strong."

448
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,802
-Oh, I see. Okay.
-Just ignore him.

449
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,907
Takashi Kamii from Weekly Jidai?

450
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,076
I looked him up on the internet.

451
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:23,281
He wrote an article
on the Higashikayama case.

452
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,049
BY TAKASHI KAMII

453
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,285
The Higashikayama case.

454
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,054
I made a call to the publisher.

455
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,989
That's hella proactive.

456
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,226
He was away from the office at the time.

457
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:40,331
The person I talked to said he would be
at the office after 4:00 p.m. today.

458
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,666
4:00 p.m. today.

459
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:45,736
It's nice that you're proactive and all,
but you don't have to rush things.

460
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:50,107
No normal person would just poke around in
someone else's house without permission.

461
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,976
He's got some screws loose.

462
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,447
If you'd like, here's something sugary
for your tired body.

463
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,015
Hey! I bought that for myself!

464
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,084
Who cares? Just stay cool!

465
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,486
Moving on.

466
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,990
I've roughly summarized
the main points of this case.

467
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:11,162
The link between Mr. Yamashita's murder
and the Higashikayama case stands out.

468
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,765
We'll start looking into the other people
whose names were mentioned

469
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,435
in Mr. Yamashita's letter.

470
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,638
I'll be visiting Tomoya once again.

471
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,742
I need him to appoint me as his counsel.

472
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,877
Okay.

473
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,714
Now, I'll ask this just in case.

474
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,950
Are you certain you want to proceed?

475
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,219
Are you okay with me proceeding?

476
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,125
I know I'm being pushy, but what if
Mr. Endo really did kill your father,

477
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,161
but is pretending to be innocent?

478
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,030
I'd never…

479
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:48,733
forgive him.

480
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,867
I'm sure.

481
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,936
But I'm a criminal defense attorney.

482
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,373
If he says he didn't do it,
I'll back him on that.

483
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,507
SUSPECT: TOMOYA ENDO

484
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,810
If there's a chance an innocent person
will be forced to suffer,

485
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,114
it's much better to let
ten actual criminals get away.

486
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:07,752
So do you just ignore criminals
who get away with it by some mistake?

487
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:11,922
You have to live with it to a certain
degree in order to do criminal trials.

488
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,091
The injustice of letting
criminals roam free

489
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,828
is of a different class than the injustice
of falsely punishing innocents.

490
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:24,235
I'm guessing it didn't
quite click for you.

491
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:29,340
A criminal trial is a balance
between trying to punish actual criminals

492
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,176
while trying to avoid
punishing innocent people.

493
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,181
We too want the people who commit
crimes to atone for their actions.

494
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:41,419
But what if an innocent person
gets convicted as a guilty one?

495
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,023
False accusations are a tragic thing.

496
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,360
Once you're the subject of suspicion,

497
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,229
it doesn't go away
even if you manage to clear your name.

498
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,965
Whether through rumors or the internet,

499
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,869
people will view you
with curiosity, inquisitiveness,

500
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,472
and sometimes even fear,
no matter where you go.

501
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,274
It sticks with you for life.

502
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,377
Something dark and murky,
yet different from filth,

503
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,779
seeps into you.

504
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,420
Could you still call it pudding
after it has become like this?

505
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:23,260
What you're about to do
is an even crueler act.

506
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,831
You might be helping unleash the person

507
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,300
who killed your father
back into the world.

508
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:34,038
It's not an unlikely possibility
if this was forged by someone else.

509
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,041
Let me translate.

510
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,810
Teru isn't trying to criticize you.

511
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,914
He's worried about the burden
you might have to deal with.

512
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,984
There's a chance
that if you go down this path,

513
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,988
you might see things you don't want to,
and learn things you wish you hadn't.

514
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,625
They might even be about your father.

515
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,700
This is…

516
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,273
pudding.

517
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,047
I'm sure my father was also…

518
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,185
worried about false accusations.

519
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:59,056
That's why he left me this letter.

520
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,994
Even if I am killed,

521
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,931
it's in part due to
unavoidable circumstances.

522
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:11,368
In order to prevent people from suffering
for crimes they didn't commit,

523
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,672
I have no choice but to ask you for help.

524
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,008
I'm sorry I couldn't be a better father.

525
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,747
Finally, I want to tell you something
I've been too shy to say.

526
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,885
Komugi, no matter what anyone says,

527
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,888
I'm proud to call you my daughter.

528
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:38,863
I know my father better than anyone.

529
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:41,966
This letter…

530
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,003
was written by my father.

531
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,439
TO KOMUGI

532
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:53,277
So you don't have to worry about me.

533
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,349
And also,

534
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,120
I trust my eyes.

535
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,454
You go ahead and trust your father.

536
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,523
And I'll trust you.

537
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,767
I'll let you know
if there are any developments.

538
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,369
Bye then. Thank you for your help.

539
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,144
Sorry to keep you waiting.

540
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,883
Sorry for scaring you back then.

541
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,587
Come on, please don't
look at me like that.

542
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,055
I'm not your enemy.

543
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,658
I guess I should introduce myself again.

544
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,529
-I'm Kamii from Jidai.
-Why were you at my house?

545
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,735
Do you mind if I just cut to the chase?

546
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,039
You're…

547
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:34,979
not Mr. Yamashita's
real daughter, are you?

548
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,357
What?

549
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,128
Will I be able to reach it?

550
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:57,735
That place hidden deep in the forest.

551
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:13,617
The glimmer of light you stored there.

552
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,425
What are you talking about?

553
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,429
What? But…

554
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,537
What? Brought a guardian along?

555
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,874
This is who I am.

556
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,645
Could I hear more
about what you were just talking about?

557
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,857
You'll take me to the jungle
where the peacock is, right?

558
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:57,961
-I'll sue you. Just wait.
-What are you hiding?

559
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,863
I'm the killer.

560
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:00,931
