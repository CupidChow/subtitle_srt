1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,905
On the night of Christmas Eve,

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,809
my father was murdered by someone.

3
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,911
The person arrested as the primary suspect

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,279
was Tomoya Endo.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,086
Tomoya was the son of Rikiro Endo,
a man who received the death penalty

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,390
for murdering a family
22 years ago in Higashikayama.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,528
However, my father left me a letter
that spoke of false accusations.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,968
I can assure you that knowing
everything won't put you at ease.

9
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,905
You became a member
of the Yamashita family.

10
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:43,610
I am not… Komugi Yamashita.

11
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:48,681
Both Mr. Yamashita and you
are just too good for your own sake.

12
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,820
AWAYAMA MATERNITY HOSPITAL

13
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,660
-Don't forget your lunch box.
-I have it.

14
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,229
Take care then.

15
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,865
I'm leaving now. I'll be back later.

16
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,800
Okay.

17
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,101
Bye-bye!

18
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,936
-Bye!
-Bye-bye!

19
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:10,937
Mama, I--

20
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,706
Wait a second. I'll be right there.

21
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:14,707
Okay.

22
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,042
Komugi!

23
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,912
Komugi, wake up already.

24
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,015
-It's time to get up.
-Just a little longer.

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,950
Don't you have a morning class today?

26
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,454
You're sure? You won't get up?

27
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,158
Crap! I'm going to be late!

28
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,094
-See? I told you.
-Come on.

29
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,263
-Why didn't you wake me up sooner?
-I did.

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,600
It doesn't count
if I don't actually get out of bed.

31
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,701
Seriously…

32
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,877
Oh, did that wake you up?

33
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,746
Sorry for being so loud in the morning.

34
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,982
I haven't had a lively morning in a while.

35
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,019
Breakfast will be ready soon,
so just watch TV while you wait.

36
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,722
-…affecting the traffic.
-Here.

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,958
-Thanks.
-Moving on to our next news.

38
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:09,662
Yesterday, there was a house fire
around 10 p.m. in Futtsu, Chiba.

39
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,632
Two bodies were found
in the building's charred remains.

40
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,803
The police suspect the victims were
a married couple inhabiting the house,

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,339
and are trying to verify their identities.

42
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,007
What?

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,411
It can't be.

44
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,783
MR. AKAZAWA
MISSED CALL

45
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,784
Mr. Akazawa?

46
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,023
MR. MATSUKAZE

47
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,927
Did you see the news?

48
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,862
Yes, just now.

49
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,001
Wait, is it really Mr. Awayama?

50
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,636
Most likely.

51
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,674
-Do you think…
-Yes?

52
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,915
No, it's nothing. I'll call you later.

53
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,150
Wait. Hey, what did you--

54
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,427
KYOICHIRO AWAYAMA
MANOKA TAKAHATA

55
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:21,734
Did this happen because…

56
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,506
I went to meet them?

57
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,876
A two-story building was burned down,

58
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,012
and two bodies were found
in the charred remains.

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,681
The police say

60
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:39,752
they are unable to contact the elderly
married couple who lived in the house.

61
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,122
The police are trying to verify

62
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,758
if the bodies belong
to the married couple.

63
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,235
KOMUGI

64
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,105
Chief.

65
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:03,009
We just checked
with the Chiba prefectural police.

66
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,779
The couple that died were the two

67
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,949
named in Mr. Yamashita's letter,
Kyoichiro Awayama and Manoka.

68
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,687
They're currently treating it as
an accident caused by a kerosene heater.

69
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,324
They're not considering homicide.

70
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,394
Got it.

71
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,529
But in my opinion,

72
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,433
I think it's too early to assume
this wasn't an intentional murder.

73
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,838
KYOICHIRO AWAYAMA
MANOKA TAKAHATA

74
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:37,577
Both Mr. Yamashita and you
are just too good for your own sake.

75
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,513
Chief, may I?

76
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,282
What is it?

77
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,321
This is only my conjecture at best.

78
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,025
I believe the people named in the letter

79
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,496
are all related to the Higashikayama case
in one way or another.

80
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,533
Of course, that's just my conjecture.

81
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,635
But the last person,

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,274
Ikumi Hiroshima,
has proven difficult to track down.

83
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,044
We have no idea where she is now.

84
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:18,117
Okay, see if she has anything to do
with the Higashikayama case.

85
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,686
Yes, sir!

86
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,562
Chief.

87
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,167
Did you go home yesterday?

88
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,803
Why do you ask?

89
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,273
There's fur on your suit.

90
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,742
Is this dog fur?

91
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,347
Thanks.

92
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,384
Wait.

93
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:57,190
Wasn't the pet at his house a cat?

94
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,133
Chief Akazawa.

95
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,202
May I speak with you?

96
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,541
HOUSE FIRE IN FUTTSU, CHIBA
TWO BODIES DISCOVERED

97
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,914
About the Awayama couple,
if their deaths get treated as a crime…

98
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,519
Do I need to elaborate?

99
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,857
That article was bad enough.

100
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,359
If the public finds out
that people related to

101
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,996
the Higashikayama case
keep dying of mysterious deaths…

102
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,899
Worst case, both you and I…

103
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,770
You do get it, right?

104
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,640
-I'll keep trying.
-Stop saying that!

105
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,445
You haven't even made Tomoya Endo crack.

106
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,114
But you'll keep trying?

107
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,719
You expect me to put my trust in that?

108
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,591
If I may, ma'am,

109
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,629
have you tried putting in
some work yourself?

110
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,106
Who was it that failed to get
useful testimony from Komugi Yamashita?

111
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,010
Who are you trying
to resolve this case for?

112
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,711
I take pride

113
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,615
in conducting proper investigations
that are fair to the victim!

114
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,084
Rest assured.

115
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,253
I won't make any blunders.

116
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,392
Now then,

117
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,197
I have a meeting to attend,
so if you'll excuse me.

118
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,511
Someda took his own life, right?

119
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,147
That was by all means a suicide.

120
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,349
Didn't I tell you?

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,685
I'm a coward.

122
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,060
HOUSE FIRE IN FUTTSU, CHIBA
TWO BODIES DISCOVERED

123
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,430
Could it be…

124
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,533
Surely not, right?

125
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,043
You okay, Mugi?

126
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,221
Listen.

127
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:51,631
I thought
I'd tell you this after it was all over.

128
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,269
I found out…

129
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,341
that I wasn't related
to my parents by blood.

130
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,177
What?

131
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,414
About half a year after I was born,

132
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,220
Mom and Dad took me in.

133
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:21,727
And I also learned that
the people from my blood-related family

134
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,633
had all…

135
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,371
died.

136
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:40,046
It still doesn't feel real to me.

137
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,749
Part of me still thinks
it must be a mistake.

138
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,919
And recently, I keep thinking

139
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,226
that I might have changed
the lives of others for the worse.

140
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,662
I can't help but think

141
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:02,969
that it's all happening
because I'm trying to learn the truth.

142
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,373
But even still…

143
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,512
I want to know.

144
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:22,154
Why was it
that my father had to be killed?

145
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,826
And also…

146
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:30,630
In order to prevent people from suffering
for crimes they didn't commit,

147
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,733
I have no choice but to ask you for help.

148
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:40,172
This is a duty that Dad entrusted me with.

149
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,313
Arisa?

150
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,516
Sorry.

151
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:58,324
But I don't think there's anything wrong
with you wanting to know.

152
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,296
I want you to know
that Dad's on your side.

153
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,765
I'm on your side.

154
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,767
What?

155
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,901
Just know

156
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,172
that I'll always be on your side,
no matter what happens.

157
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,307
Okay?

158
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,248
Thank you.

159
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,957
Thanks.

160
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,534
I will…

161
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,937
move forward.

162
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,675
So I can learn everything.

163
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:13,099
I told Komugi everything
and showed her the video.

164
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,282
What?

165
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,352
Miss went to meet Akazawa?

166
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,855
Are you sure she'll be all right?

167
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,458
It wouldn't be as big a problem
if you had gone with her.

168
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,629
But what if he ends up
getting information on our side?

169
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:48,167
And that's not all. If Akazawa is
connected to all these incidents,

170
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,536
Miss could be in danger!

171
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,239
I think that's quite a leap of logic.

172
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,840
You never know.

173
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,043
It was more than possible
for Akazawa to be involved

174
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,513
in the deaths of Someda
and the Awayama couple.

175
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,150
And Akazawa has been
lying to Komugi all this time.

176
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:08,387
Isn't it natural to suspect
he's involved in something nefarious?

177
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,725
I'm truly sorry.

178
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,634
So it's true then.

179
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,641
I am Uta Hayashikawa.

180
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,713
Anything I say now will just be an excuse.

181
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,215
However,

182
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
I can say this for certain.

183
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,456
Even if I could go back in time,

184
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,127
I'd make the same choice.

185
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,472
Did Mr. Awayama and his wife
really die in an accident?

186
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,541
Yes.

187
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,110
That's what the evidence points to--

188
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,615
I just can't believe that's what happened.

189
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:17,456
Is it possible that
the deaths of my father, Mr. Someda,

190
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,194
and Mr. Awayama and his wife,

191
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,533
all have something to do with me?

192
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,637
With Uta Hayashikawa?

193
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,980
Please.

194
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,386
Could you reexamine my father's death,

195
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:55,728
as well as the deaths of Mr. Someda,
Mr. Awayama and his wife…

196
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,901
and the Higashikayama case?

197
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,838
Please.

198
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,974
Komugi.

199
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,213
I can understand how you feel,
but this is just a coincidence.

200
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,787
-A coincidence?
-Yes.

201
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,123
A coincidence.

202
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:31,463
At any rate, Mr. Someda's death
and Mr. Awayama's are unrelated to you.

203
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,800
You don't have to feel
responsible for any of it.

204
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,435
Got it?

205
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,377
I've been looking for people
that could give me info on Akazawa,

206
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,212
but I've had no luck so far.

207
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,182
You sure you've tried everything?

208
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,451
I even asked friends
from my prosecutor days,

209
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,186
but didn't get a single lead.

210
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,791
People with info on Mr. Akazawa, huh?

211
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,165
Matsukaze, where's Mr. Kuze?

212
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,602
Dad is no longer going to come home, okay?

213
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,707
He said we should treat him
as if he's dead.

214
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,249
I think I can be glad
that Mom and Dad were my mom and dad.

215
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,886
I genuinely feel that way.

216
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,392
I have an idea.

217
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,963
I know someone that has info
on Mr. Akazawa.

218
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,932
You're serious?

219
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,144
Mr. Matsukaze!

220
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,080
What? Why are you here?

221
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,485
Mr. Hasami told me to take care of you
and handed me a plane ticket yesterday.

222
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,586
Hasami did?

223
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,888
You're going to see your mom, right?

224
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,392
-Well, yes.
-Mr. Hasami told me.

225
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,461
You haven't seen her in a while?

226
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,664
He told you that much? That's so not cool.

227
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,568
How long has it been?

228
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,172
-Five years?
-Maybe a bit more.

229
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,709
-Ten years?
-Maybe even more.

230
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,513
Forget a while then,
it's been an eternity.

231
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,580
An eternity?

232
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,516
But also,

233
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,019
thank you.

234
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,121
For what?

235
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,757
You're doing it to help me, right?

236
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,793
Going to see your mom?

237
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,731
I'm sure you must have
your own circumstances.

238
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,236
Some kind of reason
why you haven't seen her in so long.

239
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,776
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to accompany you.

240
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,711
Right. Wait, what?

241
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,382
Well, you've done a lot for me.

242
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,718
So I figured I could help you out
just this one time.

243
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,590
I'm fine. I can go and see her alone.

244
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,594
You might as well go sightseeing
since you get to visit Fukuoka.

245
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,598
-But I--
-Don't worry. I'll go and see her.

246
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,033
See you later then.

247
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,548
FUKUOKA AIRPORT

248

00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,229
MATSUKAZE CALLIGRAPHY CLASS

250
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,681
Oh, Yoshiteru.

251
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,717
You're already here?

252
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,185
Yes.

253
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,054
Come in.

254
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,494
-Here.
-Thank you.

255
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,396
We're almost done.

256
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,964
Okay.

257
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,568
Just wait a bit.

258
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,441
Right, now you go straight.

259
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,378
Keep going straight.

260
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,047
And stop!

261
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,650
Keep it straight.

262
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,719
Trust yourself.

263
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,257
There you go.

264
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,627
HONEST / BLUE SKY / LEFT AND RIGHT

265
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:03,402
Would it kill you to call me
every once in a while?

266
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,573
-How many years has it been?
-Five.

267
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,312
So? What is it?

268
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,447
I know how you are.

269
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,816
I'm sure you came
because you needed something.

270
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,321
About that…

271
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,828
Do you know Dad's contact info?

272
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,302
I kind of need to contact him for work.

273
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,339
That's all.

274
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,512
Thank goodness that I kept it.

275
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,314
What?

276
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,782
To tell you the truth,

277
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,921
after he left the house,
there was just one time

278
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,423
when he gave me a call.

279
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:06,098
When I answered it,
he didn't say even a single word.

280
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,735
But I knew…

281
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,840
it was your dad.

282
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,682
I wrote down that number
just in case I ever needed it.

283
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,987
I thought of calling him back a few times.

284
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,091
But it just felt like I'd lose if I did.

285
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:40,198
Let's both live respectable lives, okay?

286
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,974
HONEST

287
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,743
Here you go.

288
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,545
Thanks.

289
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,187
You come like a hurricane,
and leave just the same.

290
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,256
Sorry, I'll stay longer next time.

291
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,862
-You sure you didn't forget anything?
-Yes, I'm good.

292
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,402
I'll be back.

293
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,043
Bye then.

294
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,446
-Yoshiteru.
-Yes?

295
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,882
Come back whenever you feel like it.

296
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
This is your home.

297
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,688
Okay.

298
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:44,896
MATSUKAZE

299
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,037
You look just like your father now.

300
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,397
Did you have a good talk?

301
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,434
Well, yes.

302
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,703
That's good.

303
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,208
She was the same as always.

304
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,148
Honest to herself
and straightforward as could be.

305
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,419
She's an amazing person, honestly.

306
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,392
Compared to her,

307
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,329
I'm just a wobbly mess.

308
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,801
Back there, Mr. Mikita
called me respectable,

309
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,236
but he's totally off the mark.

310
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,107
I just make sure to appear that way.

311
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,975
It's all just pretense.

312
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,815
It just sucks.

313
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,718
A wobbly mess.

314
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,921
I think that's fine.

315
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,357
-Sorry? How?
-I think it's respectable.

316
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,594
To wobble as you grow.

317
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,668
I think it's fine
to be like that sometimes.

318
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,507
You really think so?

319
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,544
I know so.

320
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:43,982
How about you?

321
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,517
What were you doing?

322
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,853
-Me?
-Yes.

323
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,690
I went to Ainoshima.

324
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,092
There were so many cats there.

325
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,461
It was like heaven.

326
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,201
It's my treat today.

327
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,105
-I get it.
-Yes, let's not do that now.

328
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,280
RAMEN

329
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,516
SHINRYU RAMEN

330
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,917
Oh, that's good.

331
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,219
It's good, isn't it?

332
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,022
Here you go!
Hakata's special tonkotsu ramen for you.

333
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,423
-There you go.
-Thank you.

334
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,360
-Here's yours too, ma'am.
-Thank you.

335
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,427
Please enjoy.

336
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,697
-It looks so cloudy.
-That's your first impression?

337
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,673
If you do this, they break evenly in half.

338
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,674
Like so.

339
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,942
-Wow.
-Yes.

340
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,510
-Wait, that's…
-Wait, really?

341
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,145
-Look, I get it.
-Don't get it.

342
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,813
Also, I told you to stop that.

343
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,115
But you said it too.

344
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,552
-I didn't know lawyers steal too!
-"Steal"?

345
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,690
-I'm the one who taught him that.
-Really?

346
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,393
See?

347
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,394
That's really neat.

348
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,995
It really is.

349
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,365
Thanks for the meal.

350
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,369
Yum! That's the best I've ever had.

351
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,004
Right?

352
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,472
It really might be the best.

353
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,513
But Mr. Someda's ramen was also the best.

354
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,548
How can both be the best?

355
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,628
Ramen tastes extra good
when I eat it with you, Dad.

356
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,532
Same here.

357
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,504
This is a first.

358
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,373
How so?

359
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:55,313
I wish I could get ramen
even though I'm already eating ramen.

360
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,784
That's a first.

361
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,395
-That's where you say, "I get it."
-Yes, but you just…

362
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,398
-Never mind.
-You're being too difficult.

363
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,669
-Excuse me, could I have some oden?
-Sure.

364
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,105
-Give me one of every type.
-Every?

365
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,907
-Really?
-Well, I'm not the one paying.

366
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:33,351
When was the last time
you went to see my old man?

367
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:39,724
I've been too busy
to pay him a visit recently.

368
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,162
I've been dealing with one thing
after another, you see.

369
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,967
But I do have some good news in exchange.

370
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,539
I got my hands on something interesting.

371
00:27:58,977 --> 00:27:59,911
DIAMOND CLUB

372
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,381
And that is?

373
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,494
-Is that--
-I've finally found her.

374
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:21,866
The last person that holds the key
to the Higashikayama case.

375
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:31,376
Well, in any case,
we've almost reached the truth now.

376
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,413
That's all I have for today.

377
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,349
See you later then.

378
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,254
Right.

379
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:49,594
Next time I come here,
do you want me to bring you anything?

380
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:00,972
Recently, I've been wanting
to play some baseball.

381
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,445
Don't think I can manage that.

382
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:38,910
Excuse me.

383
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,086
Yoshiteru?

384
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:52,824
I…

385
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,995
What's wrong?

386
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,297
It's just…

387
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,467
What did I call you before?

388
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,408
I think you just called me "Dad."

389
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,943
Did I?

390
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:13,745
Yes.

391
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,185
You must've put in a lot of work.

392
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,125
Is your mother doing well?

393
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,259
She is.

394
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,698
Hey… Are you…

395
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,900
Oh, right.

396
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,437
I'm working as a security guard
at my acquaintance's company.

397
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,339
I also help with the accounting.

398
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,141
I see.

399
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,781
But you know, I'm relieved.

400
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,619
I was always worried that I had caused
trouble for you and your mom.

401
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,421
You did cause trouble.

402
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,389
You're right.

403
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,625
-I'm sorry.
-No.

404
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,062
That was my bad.
I'm not here to criticize you.

405
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,064
I'm here for work.

406
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:07,498
Okay.

407
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,302
I have a question.

408
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,139
You know Mr. Akazawa, right?

409
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,544
How do you know Akazawa?

410
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,780
I'm currently representing a person

411
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,184
that was arrested for the murder
of a former police officer.

412
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,854
Wait, do you mean Mr. Yamashita's murder?

413
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:30,855
Yes.

414
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,026
The detective in charge
of that case is Mr. Akazawa.

415
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,728
That's why I asked.

416
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:43,568
Yoshiteru, be wary of Akazawa.

417
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,770
What do you mean?

418
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,673
He's the kind of man…

419
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,476
You did it! Admit it!

420
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,681
…that wasn't afraid to cross any line
for the sake of resolving a case.

421
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:03,788
I warned Akazawa himself,
as well as my superiors.

422
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,991
I told them he would
cause problems someday.

423
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,260
I warned them several times.

424
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:16,034
Akazawa must have held a grudge.

425
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,138
A police officer in his thirties
was arrested for stealing

426
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,741
a bag filled with cash from a car.

427
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,778
RYOGOKU POLICE STATION

428
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,383
RYOGOKU POLICE STATION

429
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,462
Akazawa.

430
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,474
That was the last time I saw him.

431
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,313
But I'd never have imagined
you'd be handling Mr. Yamashita's case.

432
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,749
Did you know Mr. Yamashita?

433
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:10,088
Actually,
Mr. Yamashita contacted me some time ago.

434
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,522
What?

435
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,325
He wanted to ask me
something about Akazawa.

436
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,365
-Sorry for bothering you.
-It's okay. What did you need?

437
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:25,670
I'm actually reinvestigating a case
that Akazawa and I handled 22 years ago.

438
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:30,708
It was a mass murder
that happened in Higashikayama.

439
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,944
-Okay, I understand.
-Yes.

440
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,214
I'm afraid I was no longer
a part of the police by that time.

441
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,016
I see.

442
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,254
That was the only time I talked to him.

443
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,025
But I had this feeling
after talking to him.

444
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,329
Unlike me who just ran away,

445
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,602
Mr. Yamashita kept fighting
in order to correct his own mistakes.

446
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,408
I should have done the same.

447
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,983
But it's too late for that now.

448
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,089
Yoshiteru.

449
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,593
I put you through a lot.

450
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,596
I'm so sorry.

451
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:39,377
I should get going soon.
I have the night shift today.

452
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,912
Oh, right.

453
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,888
Hey, wait.

454
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,330
Did you really not steal--

455
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:06,904
I trust my father,
as well as the letter he wrote.

456
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,507
I trust all of it!

457
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:15,646
I think I can be glad
that Mom and Dad were my mom and dad.

458
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,816
I genuinely feel that way.

459
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,790
What's wrong?

460
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,065
Dad.

461
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,472
I'm sorry.

462
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,842
For not trusting you.

463
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,255
Yoshiteru.

464
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,194
I feel like I've finally…

465
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,834
been set free.

466
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:46,003
HOUSE FIRE IN FUTTSU, CHIBA
TWO BODIES DISCOVERED

467
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,044
Here you go.

468
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,116
I got you a souvenir.

469
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,518
-What?
-I was in Fukuoka.

470
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:01,652
For me?

471
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:03,788
What did you get?

472
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,558
I got it since it looked cute.

473
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,361
It was for sale in Ainoshima,
an island with lots of cats.

474
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,362
Really?

475
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,298
It's so cute.

476
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,536
Consider it a thanks for the charm.

477
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,640
What a lovely present.

478
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,774
Thank you.

479
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,043
Also…

480
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,551
I came here today because…

481
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,721
I heard from Akazawa.

482
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,424
Komugi.

483
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,496
I'm sorry for keeping it
a secret from you all this time.

484
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,702
But please understand, Komugi.

485
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:56,974
I want you to live
a happy life as Komugi Yamashita.

486
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:03,948
It's okay for you to forget
that you used to be Uta Hayashikawa.

487
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,318
I wish…

488
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,089
I could do that.

489
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,124
You should.

490
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,325
But that's…

491
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,362
impossible.

492
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,434
The fact that I am Uta Hayashikawa…

493
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,005
can never be erased.

494
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,944
Listen.

495
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:41,485
Mamoru doesn't know about your past.

496
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:48,259
He just became a police officer.
This is an important period for him.

497
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:53,331
If it came to light that his father
was involved in all of this…

498
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,242
I'm really sorry.

499
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,547
But I have a role as a mother.

500
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,417
Please.

501
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,120
Do it for our sake.

502
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,723
Forget it ever happened!

503
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,628
What…

504
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,799
A hundred million?

505
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,672
What?

506
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,412
Is this supposed to be hush money?

507
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:46,050
-It's an apology.
-Where did you get all that money?

508
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,553
I told you before.
I keep secrets from Akazawa too.

509
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,723
Please, just take it.

510
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:57,128
And never tell Akazawa
or anyone else about this.

511
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:00,164
Keep it a secret between you and me.

512
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,735
Please, take it. Don't go any further--

513
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,070
I will not stop!

514
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,774
I promise you…

515
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,578
I will reach the truth.

516
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,418
I will find out why my father was killed.

517
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,955
And what it was that he wanted me to do.

518
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,826
I'm leaving.

519
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,438
Right, one more thing.

520
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,575
Mr. Yamashita said something
strange about Akazawa.

521
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:51,715
By the way, I wanted to ask if you knew
that Akazawa and his wife

522
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,352
were living separately
during the period the crime occurred?

523
00:40:56,086 --> 00:41:00,324
Apparently, his wife once left
the house with their child.

524
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,595
Well, I can only assume
he had his own troubles.

525
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,967
Living separately?

526
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,217

00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,322
-Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.

528
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,756
See you.

DIAMOND CLUB

530
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,930
I finally found you.

531
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,535
Ikumi Hiroshima.

532
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,931
Never tell Akazawa
or anyone else about this.

533
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:27,244
Both Ms. Kyoko and Mr. Akazawa
are still hiding something.

534
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,928
The forensic test results came in.

535
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:44,895
What does it say?

536
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:48,232
That white fur matches the fur
of the dog that we took custody of

537
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,466
from the Awayama house.

538
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,302
It does?

539
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,104
Where did you get it?

540
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,774
Come here.

541
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,844
It was on Chief Akazawa's suit.

542
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,047
Chief Akazawa?

543
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:07,318
Wait, wouldn't that mean he was at
the Awayama residence before the crime?

544
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,019
I don't know.

545
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:14,592
But I do know
that he's hiding something from us.

546
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,493
I'm sure of it.

547
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,098
DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR

548
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,470
Sorry for calling you over so suddenly.

549
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,373
This is unusual of you.

550
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,477
I just wanted to confirm something.

551
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,848
Really now?

552
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,986
I guess you must be a coward too.

553
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,561
The house fire at that
former maternity hospital…

554
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,934
Do you have anything to do with it?

555
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,538
Dad.

556
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,379
Answer me, Dad!

557
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,140
There has to be more.

558
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,541
Will you team up with me?

559
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,276
You can't go there.

560
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,678
The culprit!

561
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,546
Even if it leads to hell.

562
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,715
Let's go and find the peacock.

563
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,383
