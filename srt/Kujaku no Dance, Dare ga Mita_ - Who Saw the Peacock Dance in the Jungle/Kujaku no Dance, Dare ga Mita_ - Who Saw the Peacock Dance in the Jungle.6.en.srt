1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,139
On the night of Christmas Eve,

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:09,642
my father was murdered by someone.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,479
The person arrested as the primary suspect

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,381
was Tomoya Endo.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:20,653
Tomoya was the son of Rikiro Endo,
a man who received the death penalty

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,190
for murdering a family
22 years ago in Higashikayama.

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,362
However, my father left me a letter
that spoke of false accusations.

8
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,533
Rikiro, is not the person…

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,103
that's responsible for the murders.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,107
He was transferred to a hospital
where he ultimately died.

11
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,709
It might have been suicide.

12
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,979
Then Mr. Someda died.

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,316
We're going to go and meet Tatsuo Mikita,
a person whose name was in the letter.

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,886
The defense attorney
in the Higashikayama case?

15
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:59,159
He said he wanted his son
to focus on living his own life,

16
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,628
and he abandoned
his request for a retrial.

17
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,197
Excuse me, but do you know
what happened to Uta?

18
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,866
I believe their name was Tsujii.

19
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:07,901
Chief.

20
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:11,204
It seems that Matsukaze's father
used to be a police officer.

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,342
I'll personally handle
Ms. Komugi Yamashita.

22
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,412
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

23
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,123
Ms. Komugi Yamashita?

24
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,226
I'm Anan, a public prosecutor.
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,862
I'm Yamashita.

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,100
-And you would be?
-Hello.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,202
A guardian, perhaps?

28
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,638
Something like that.
I'm Matsukaze, an attorney.

29
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,678
I'm afraid that I'll require
Komugi to come alone.

30
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,582
I'll have to ask
any guardians to wait here.

31
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,350
Let's go then.

32
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,552
Could I ask just one question?

33
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,824
-What is it?
-Why do you need to talk to Komugi?

34
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,863
Is it to question a member
of Mr. Haruo Yamashita's family?

35
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,698
No, that doesn't seem likely.

36
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,735
In which case, perhaps you wish
to talk to her about Mr. Someda's case.

37
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,973
That's correct.

38
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,943
The investigation requires
Komugi's cooperation.

39
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,514
-Then why are you the one--
-You asked for one question.

40
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,182
Did you not?

41
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,089
You don't need to overreact.

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,826
I'll only ask Komugi
a few questions and that'll be it.

43
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,430
Overprotective,

44
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,266
aren't you?

45
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,336
Shall we go now?

46
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,078
Komugi?

47
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,850
Your cooperation is voluntary,
so you can leave if you want.

48
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:08,321
Also, absolutely do not sign any statement

49
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,590
that contains things
you didn't actually say.

50
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,493
Make sure the record
only contains things you actually said.

51
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,028
Got it?

52
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,665
Yes.

53
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,600
I wanted to check

54
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,937
just how much of the full picture
she's managed to uncover.

55
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,473
The important thing is

56
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,244
to ensure that her perception
of the letter is that it's a forgery

57
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,846
created by Someda.

58
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,850
If the letter is seen as a forgery,

59
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,420
then even if Haruo Yamashita left
other pieces of evidence

60
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,926
pertaining to the truth
behind the Higashikayama incident,

61
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:25,732
they will also be suspected of being
fabricated and have less credibility.

62
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,300
Understood.

63
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,704
If Tomoya Endo ends up being acquitted,

64
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,275
it will leave a stain on your record.

65
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,711
You'll go down in a flash.

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,585
Someda took his own life, right?

67
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,589
That was by all means a suicide.

68
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:54,027
He couldn't bear the weight
of his own sins, so he chose death.

69
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,029
It wasn't me.

70
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,032
Didn't I tell you?

71
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,467
I'm a coward.

72
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,114
I've been told that Mr. Haruo Yamashita
was an excellent police officer.

73
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,553
I'd like to offer
my sincere condolences for your loss.

74
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,557
Thank you.

75
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,259
Getting to the point,

76
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:31,197
I've read the letter that's presumed
to have been written by Mr. Haruo.

77
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,832
Excuse me,

78
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,604
that letter was most definitely
written by my father.

79
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,844
So that's your interpretation of it.

80
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,514
Let me state my view.

81
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,918
I believe this letter was written

82
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:56,556
by Mr. Someda at Tomoya Endo's direction.

83
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,624
Based on the circumstances.

84
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,664
But Mr. Someda said that my father wrote--

85
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,499
Someda had the skills.

86
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,169
Skills required to mimic
someone's handwriting.

87
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,174
The last time you met Mr. Someda,

88
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,277
what did you talk about with him?

89
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,818
At the time…

90
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,886
Komugi!

91
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,355
-I'll wait here.
-What?

92
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,458
I have to let the regulars know
the shop's closed today.

93
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,831
Those were

94
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,835
his last words.

95
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,239
Was that really all?

96
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,341
Are you sure?

97
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,611
Yes.

98
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,350
Most likely, after Someda was alone,

99
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,920
he responded to a call from that person.

100
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,590
If that's the case, then this girl

101
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,430
doesn't know that Someda
talked to him on the phone.

102
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,066
I understand.

103
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,941
On another note, were you
aware of it, Komugi?

104
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,676
Of what?

105
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:29,115
Of Mr. Someda's substance abuse.

106
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,585
I heard from him.

107
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,055
-That in the past, he--
-In the present too.

108
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,392
What?

109
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,961
The autopsy revealed as much.

110
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,702
Given that fact, how about this theory?

111
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,772
Mr. Someda needed money
to fuel his addiction.

112
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,642
So he took Tomoya's offer and wrote
the letter in Mr. Yamashita's name.

113
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,346
But he'd known you since you were little
and didn't want to hurt you,

114
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,449
so he decided to tell you a lie.

115
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,085
A lie about the letter

116
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:11,057
having actually been written
by Mr. Haruo Yamashita.

117
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,762
Well?

118
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,334
Don't you think
that sounds more plausible?

119
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,170
Based on the circumstances.

120
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,307
How about it?

121
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,311
Did that perhaps change your…

122
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,149
perception of your father's letter?

123
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,959
No, it did not.

124
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,731
That letter

125
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,968
was entrusted to me by my father.

126
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,041
What's your basis?

127
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:08,247
I can just tell.

128
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,352
That's my basis.

129
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:22,461
Mr. Someda said he thought
of my father as an actual sibling.

130
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,032
That's why him forging that letter

131
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,136
is out of the question.

132
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,974
Please include that in the record.

133
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,947
You're a good daughter
to have such faith in your father.

134
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,716
I couldn't help
but be moved by your dedication.

135
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,786
Take care now.

136
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,765
I can just…

137
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,734
tell.

138
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,406
"I can just tell,"

139
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:09,875
is it?

140
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,552
Yes, hello?

141
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,287
Oh, hello.

142
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,724
Yuki? Is this a good time?

143
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,129
You remember that gift we received
at the end of last year?

144
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:35,434
That letter
was entrusted to me by my father.

145
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,638
From Aunt Shoko over in Takamatsu.

146
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,874
I was thinking we should gift them
something in return…

147
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,075
Komugi.

148
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,380
You must be a good child
that cares for your parents.

149
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,716
Not like me at all.

150
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:56,822
Because I am a failure of a daughter.

151
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,558
Mom, I did it!

152
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,795
THIS CERTIFIES THAT YUKI ANAN
HAS PASSED THE BAR EXAM

153
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,264
You really passed it?

154
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,235
Wait, is it okay to tell
your dad about this?

155
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:15,007
I think their son took
the bar exam too, didn't he?

156
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,512
This woman cared less about my life

157
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,482
than she did about keeping
that man in a good mood.

158
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,853
Your dad hasn't come
to visit at all recently.

159
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,728
I'm sure he must have found someone else.

160
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,634
This woman was that man's mistress.

161
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,672
And the child that
the two of them birthed was me.

162
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,374
You have to stay with me, Yuki.

163
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,611
Or else, I… won't be able to bear it.

164
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,050
I will never reach
an understanding with this woman.

165
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,120
Mom.

166
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,692
I'm going to get married.

167
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:14,200
After that, I kept working without rest.

168
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,676
YOU ARE HEREBY APPOINTED
TO THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT

169
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,081
Special Investigation Department
at the Yokohama Prosecutor's Office?

170
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,417
That's a quick promotion.

171
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:32,985
I guess it is.

172
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,494
It reeks in here again.

173
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,362
Do you even clean the drain?

174
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,600
-I do.
-How did you get it to stink this bad?

175
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,702
-I'll clean it.
-It's fine.

176
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,171
Don't you have paperwork to look over?

177
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,039
Like always.

178
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,310
Do you have to say it like that?

179
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,613
What? Am I wrong?

180
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,019
Oh, but I do have this thought a lot.

181
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,457
That the person I married wasn't Yuki,

182
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,995
but just a woman that was a coworker.

183
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,666
I'm busting my ass over here too,

184
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,805
but I guess my coworker's just too gifted.

185
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,079
Yuki…

186
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,585
It must have hurt so much
to get divorced like that.

187
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,721
Do you see now?

188
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,358
You didn't have enough charm.

189
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,628
Women need to be lovable above all.

190
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,969
And yet, you poured
all your time and effort into work.

191
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,508
But I still…

192
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,146
don't want to become

193
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,616
like you, Mom.

194
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,587
Don't you think so, Yuki?

195
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,324
Should I go with a gift set?

196
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,126
Hello? Yuki?

197
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,163
-Yuki?
-Sorry, but I have work to do, Mom.

198
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,998
I'll call you later.

199
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,642
Komugi.

200
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,385
I will need more time to get
Komugi Yamashita to believe

201
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,090
that the letter was forged.

202
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,493
Is that so?

203
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,462
I apologize.

204
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,531
Nothing to apologize for.

205
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:05,304
Although, I'll admit that it did
disappoint me a little to hear that.

206
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,275
Let's move on to the next step then.

207
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,444
We'll use him…

208
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,683
and get Tomoya Endo

209
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:23,155
to admit to paying Someda
and making him forge that letter.

210
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,024
How?

211
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,661
I received an intriguing
piece of information, you see.

212
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,363
I'll send it your way.

213
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,635
I hope you won't disappoint me this time.

214
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,175
Mr. Someda was still using drugs?

215
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,681
For a moment there, I felt like my mind

216
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,418
just went completely blank for a moment.

217
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,487
But…

218
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,590
You decided to trust Mr. Someda.

219
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,064
I do understand.

220
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,701
I know that I have no real basis for it.

221
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,504
But…

222
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,508
But even then…

223
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,546
I want to believe him.

224
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,352
Maybe what Ms. Anan said was right.

225
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,520
But…

226
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:35,627
Even if that's so,
I feel like I have to make sure.

227
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,331
I want…

228
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,935
to know it all.

229
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,705
And after I know it all,

230
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,874
I want to say it.

231
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,081
That I trust the people…

232
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,720
who were dear to me.

233
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,435
PROSECUTOR YUKI ANAN

234
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,203
NO SUBJECT, NO TEXT
ONE FILE ATTACHED

235
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:28,113
RELATION TO SUBJECT: FATHER
NAME: MASAKATSU KUZE

236
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,956
Hello.

237
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,992
I've got a lot more fun stories.

238
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,762
-Would you like some coffee? Just wait.
-Sure.

239
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,498
-I'm so glad you're back!
-What?

240
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,900
I thought I was going to die.

241
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,602
He talked about his grandson
for two whole hours!

242
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,205
I'll keep it at that
since Mr. Matsukaze is here,

243
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,941
but my grandson really is a prodigy!

244
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,378
How many kids can name
100 different types of seashells, huh?

245
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,846
He's the guy from the texts.

246
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,283
These are all the days
I met your dad at court.

247
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,485
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

248
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,289
He handled the case
that Mr. Haruo attended in court.

249
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,658
Oh, right!

250
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,861
I'm the other attorney
that Mr. Haruo Yamashita

251
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,963
came to see in court.

252
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,332
You're the one?

253
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,634
A pleasure to meet you.

254
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,305
I'm Narukawa.

255
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,111
The other lawyer that Dad went to see…

256
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,981
is this person?

257
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,821
Hello there.

258
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,191
I'm Kamii from Weekly Jidai,
who got filed a complaint

259
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,193
for trespassing on a crime scene.

260
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,731
Any developments
in Haruo Yamashita's case?

261
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,633
And also,

262
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,936
about that lawyer Matsukaze
who's defending Tomoya Endo.

263
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,471
Isn't he the son

264
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,941
of your former superior,

265
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,944
Mr. Kuze?

266
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,580
RELATION TO SUBJECT: FATHER

267
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,819
Oh, you need to do better
if you're a police officer.

268
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,855
Your expressions are
just giving everything away.

269
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,625
I can read your agitation all too clearly.

270
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,427
You know what it's like?

271
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,298
"Something happened in the past
between me and Mr. Kuze!"

272
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,199
Hey!

273
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,469
It's like you're yelling it out.

274
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,642
Look. I'm just a poor reporter
that's trying his best to make ends meet.

275
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,247
I got good at observation
since it helped put food on the table.

276
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,484
"Put food on the table."

277
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,353
Doesn't that phrase paint a good picture?

278
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,690
What do you want?

279
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,028
I brought something for you today
as a means of apology.

280
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,502
No need to be alarmed.
You won't find three million yen in here.

281
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:09,007
Oh, that's the amount
that Mr. Haruo left to Komugi.

282
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,843
It's just a little joke.

283
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,380
One that lets you know the things I know.

284
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,482
A funny little joke from a reporter.

285
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,920
Please.

286
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,389
Take a look.

287
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,302
It will be on the shelves this week.

288
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,104
I wanted you to see it first.

289
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,319
So you're Mr. Haruo Yamashita's daughter?

290
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,454
Yes.

291
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,789
I heard about you
from Mr. Turtle Glasses here.

292
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,991
Turtle?

293
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,493
I'm sure you've been through a lot.

294
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,696
I never met the man, but I just know it.

295
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,500
I'm sure he must've been
a caring and bighearted fellow.

296
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,871
I'm more reliable than I look, I promise.
Tell me if you ever need help.

297
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,072
No need to hold back.

298
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,809
"Ms. Yamashita" doesn't quite feel right.

299
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,345
Can I just call you "Miss"?

300
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,316
Let me introduce myself.

301
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,753
I'm Toru Narukawa.

302
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,722
I'm a defense attorney, despite the look.

303
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,893
Although you two probably have
more years of experience than me.

304
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,796
-What?
-I left my previous job to become one.

305
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,532
-I used to be a public prosecutor.
-Public prosecutor?

306
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,235
My agency is in Ginza
and my son is the representative.

307
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,905
But my son only cares
about damn civil cases!

308
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,875
Don't you think he should've walked
in his father's footsteps?

309
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,612
Right? You think so, right?
He's got no competitiveness!

310
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,148
His wife's family runs a huge corporation,

311
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,551
and just recently, he got adopted
into the family as an official heir!

312
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,354
To put it in plain terms,
we've got deep pockets!

313
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,093
What's wrong?

314
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,862
-Did someone turn you to stone?
-Well…

315
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,333
-It certainly felt like someone did.
-Well, that's enough of that.

316
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,735
Let's get to business.

317
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,073
I'll lend you a hand.

318
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,577
Why would you help us?

319
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,883
I think this Tomoya Endo kid…

320
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,288
wasn't the one who did it.

321
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,260
But that said,

322
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,063
I don't think he can get out
of being prosecuted.

323
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,669
I'd like to know how you plan
to approach things, Mr. Matsukaze.

324
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,238
Would you mind telling me?

325
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,318
Mr. Narukawa.

326
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:12,257
Everything I'm about to tell you
is strictly confidential.

327
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,859
I know the drill.

328
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,041
Too bad it didn't go anywhere.

329
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,410
We'll have to try again.

330
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,447
Chief?

331
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,058
Seriously?

332
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:51,129
-What is it?
-Take a look.

333
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,969
"Mysterious Death of Ramen Stall Owner
a Link to the Higashikayama Incident.

334
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,641
The victim was the owner of a ramen stall
that Haruo Yamashita frequently visited."

335
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,878
Did our information get leaked?

336
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,414
More importantly, look at this part.

337
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,719
"Detective A was in charge
of the questioning,

338
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,889
and he was also involved
in the Higashikayama case."

339
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,926
Mr. Akazawa?

340
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,634
"He has also conducted
harsh interrogations in the past,

341
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:34,539
leading some to voice misgivings
about him potentially crossing the line."

342
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,311
You did it! Admit it!

343
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,583
Who do you think cares more about you?

344
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,918
Me or that lawyer?

345
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:50,755
Listen closely.

346
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,926
Make the right call.

347
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,329
Akazawa.

348
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,431
Don't you think you're going too far?

349
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,600
They won't submit unless you go that far.

350
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,135
Submit, you say?

351
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,705
What's up with you?

352
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,840
Suspects pretty much always lie.

353
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,210
You're the one
who taught me that, Mr. Kuze.

354
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,781
That man likely isn't the culprit.

355
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,021
Akazawa, you need to make the right call

356
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,323
about what the truth is.

357
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,827
Don't set someone up as a criminal!

358
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,296
Set someone up?

359
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:36,201
What you're wielding
against those suspects isn't justice.

360
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,270
It's senseless violence!

361
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,073
Akazawa.

362
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,278
I'm always watching you.

363
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,524
PROSECUTOR ANAN

364
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,930
-Yes?
-Could I have some of your time?

365
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,465
I went to go and see Mr. A.

366
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,935
You mean Akazawa?

367
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,104
I wanted to see his reaction.

368
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,173
You're unbelievable.

369
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,411
I'm excited to see the public's response.

370
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,647
If this one sells well,
remember to treat me to some sushi.

371
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,884
-From Azabu, the one Brad Pitt visited.
-Okay, sure.

372
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,586
Thanks.

373
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,458
MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF RAMEN STALL OWNER
A LINK TO THE HIGASHIKAYAMA INCIDENT

374
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,995
-Where did you--
-Does it matter where I got it from?

375
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,531
Did I not clearly instruct you?

376
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,267
Not to let the public know about

377
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,270
the relation between Someda's death
and the Higashikayama case.

378
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,540
I apologize.

379
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,344
Let me confirm something with you.

380
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,047
Are you really doing your job?

381
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,621
Once this is published, people will
soon figure out who "Detective A" is.

382
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,091
That's the kind of age we live in now.

383
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,864
What do you think will happen
when they find out?

384
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,537
Even a small ember
can set an entire forest ablaze.

385
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:25,577
In the past, you could've pressured
the publisher into erasing such articles,

386
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,279
but now that would
just make for another article.

387
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,515
Are you trying to say

388
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:35,220
that you want me gone before that happens?

389
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:40,692
No.

390
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,229
Quite the opposite, in fact.

391
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,368
You're quite skilled
at what you do, Mr. Akazawa.

392
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,339
I looked into the cases
you've handled in the past.

393
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,242
DETECTIVE A WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE QUESTIONING

394
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,912
You've gotten confessions
out of countless suspects,

395
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,949
getting them to plead guilty,
have you not?

396
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,889
I have no objections
to you taking some rough measures.

397
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,894
Isn't that your forte?

398
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,068
I even got to hear
your strategy for this case,

399
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,070
so it's been a fruitful day, I say.

400
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,538
Thank you for your help too.

401
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,940
Don't mention it, really.

402
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,675
-Miss!
-Yes?

403
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,712
I promise that we'll find
the truth of the matter

404
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,847
that your father arrived at.

405
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,216
Okay.

406
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,686
Okay then, I'll be back tomorrow!

407
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,891
-You'll be back?
-Tomorrow too?

408
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,927
But he seems reliable.

409
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,862
-Don't you mean weird?
-Weird indeed.

410
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,733
But it's true that it's tough doing
those meetings with Tomoya alone.

411
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,603
We still haven't talked
to all the people in Mr. Haruo's letter.

412
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,739
We're falling behind.

413
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,907
What happened to Uta?

414
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,678
I believe she was taken in by a relative.

415
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,913
Do you have that person's contact info?

416
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,083
I believe their name was Tsujii.

417
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:13,885
Hey.

418
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,820
Tomorrow,

419
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,892
could we go and visit that Tsujii person
that took in Uta Hayashikawa?

420
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,162
Kouta Tsujii.

421
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,864
TATSUO MIKITA
KOUTA TSUJII

422
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,901
Would you please come with me?

423
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,971
I can't. I have a meeting
with Tomoya Endo.

424
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,172
How about you, Hasami?

425
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,875
Oh, sorry. My schedule is full tomorrow.

426
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,843
I see.

427
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,680
I'll go on my own then.

428
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,750
Except we don't even know
what kind of person this Tsujii is.

429
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,552
What if he's not cool?

430
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,122
Oh, I'm a bit worried
about you going alone.

431
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,493
Who would be a good person
to accompany you?

432
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,431
-Did you think of it too?
-Yes.

433
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,332
-Right?
-Yes.

434
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,801
-It's decided then.
-Stay cool.

435
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,335
What?

436
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,482
Miss!

437
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,153
-That was so loud.
-So sorry!

438
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,590
It took some time to pick my clothes.

439
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,425
How about it? Don't I look dapper?

440
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,093
Let's go. Let's just go.

441
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,797
-Miss!
-Please be quieter.

442
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,201
-Hey, nice throw!
-Yes, I did it.

443
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,436
Here you go. Nice catch.

444
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,604
Okay, I got it.

445
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,339
-I'll try it.
-Swing all the way.

446
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,309
There you go! That's good.

447
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,312
-Okay, got it.
-The ball felt a lot faster.

448
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,192
Hey, that was a good one.

449
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,132
Your throws reach pretty far now.

450
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,836
-Want to learn how to throw a curveball?
-Wait, really?

451
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,471
Yes.

452
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,144
-Nice throw! That was a good one.
-Nice catch.

453
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,047
-All right, come at me.
-Okay, here I go.

454
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,918
-Nice ball.
-Nice catch! Good one.

455
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,219
-My turn.
-Go ahead.

456
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,690
Are you really doing your job?

457
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:36,027
I have no objections
to you taking some rough measures.

458
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,234
We'll rearrest Tomoya Endo
on a murder charge.

459
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,136
We need a warrant.

460
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,473
Apply for one immediately.

461
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,542
Understood, sir.

462
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,750
Whatever it takes,
we'll make Tomoya Endo submit!

463
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,785
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

464
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,669
MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF RAMEN STALL OWNER

465
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,472
Just who gave this article to Anan?

466
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,809
Akazawa.

467
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,414
I'm always watching you.

468
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:35,620
Mr. Kuze…

469
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,926
That's a cute little charm
you've got there.

470
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,461
What a cute kitty cat.

471
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,063
I got it as a gift.

472
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,098
Oh, that's nice.

473
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,767
-I'm a cat person too.
-Oh, really?

474
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,337
I have two as pets.

475
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,039
You get a lot of fur on you
if you hug them.

476
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,308
I think it's around here, right?

477
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,877
TSUJII

478
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,947
There we are! This is the place.

479
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,352
Mr. Tsujii is the cousin
of Yasunari Hayashikawa,

480
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,654
who died in the Higashikayama incident.

481
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,491
He's also the person
that took in Uta Hayashikawa.

482
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,895
Which means one of the people
inside this house might be

483
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,330
Uta Hayashikawa.

484
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,769
No need to make that face, Miss.

485
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,072
You've got nothing to worry about.

486
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,488
Yes?

487
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,457
Sorry to disturb you while you're busy.

488
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,794
I'm Narukawa, an attorney.

489
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,331
Am I correct in assuming
this is Kouta Tsujii's residence?

490
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,200
Yes, that's correct.

491
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,835
What do you want?

492
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,506
Do you happen to know
a person named Haruo Yamashita?

493
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,109
What if I do?

494
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,213
I take it that you've met
Mr. Haruo Yamashita.

495
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,748
Perhaps he came to this house.

496
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,617
Yes, so what if he did?

497
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,490
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about Mr. Haruo Yamashita,

498
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,460
as well as the person you took in,
Uta Hayashikawa--

499
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,595
I have nothing to say to you.

500
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,735
I don't think he's coming out.

501
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,473
We might have to try again
some other time with a better strategy.

502
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,842
But that's…

503
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,994
What's gotten into you, Miss?

504
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,866
I'm tired of it.

505
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,806
I'm tired of disappointing myself.

506
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:12,577
That's why I'll do whatever I can.

507
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,378
Miss…

508
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,284
I HAVE A PROBLEM
PEOPLE MISTAKE ME FOR UTA HAYASHIKAWA

509
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:21,886
I am

510
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,691
Haruo Yamashita's daughter,
Komugi Yamashita!

511
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,397
Could you hear me out
just for a little while?

512
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,200
I HAVE A PROBLEM
PEOPLE MISTAKE ME FOR UTA HAYASHIKAWA

513
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,069
Mr. Tsujii!

514
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,210
Miss, let's throw in the towel for today.

515
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,684
Mr. Tsujii!

516
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,976
Right now, I'm planning your defense
against the arson allegation,

517
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,312
assuming the case goes to court.

518
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,383
Hence, I would like you to keep silent
no matter what you are--

519
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,318
Forget about all that.

520
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,153
I have a favor to ask.

521
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:31,923
What is it?

522
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,992
Go and meet my old man.

523
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,266
Can I ask why?

524
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:45,870
Why?

525
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,439
You need to ask that?

526
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,044
Obviously, because I want to know

527
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,515
the truth behind
the Higashikayama incident.

528
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,490
I don't have enough time or manpower
to dig into the Higashikayama case.

529
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,259
First, let's focus on your--

530
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,761
Real good at lining up
excuses, aren't you?

531
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,398
You just don't have the guts.

532
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,602
The guts to go and talk to my old man!

533
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:33,618
If only I was talking to Kamii.

534
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,623
I hate it.

535
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:44,061
That look in your…

536
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:45,630
eyes.

537
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:54,538
Those eyes, filled to the brim with pity.

538
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,880
I bet you feel sorry for me, don't you?

539
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,786
The son of a criminal
that doesn't even have any smarts.

540
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,921
That's why

541
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,892
you feel like you have to save me.

542
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,766
You must have lived a privileged life.

543
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,869
Right, Mr. Attorney?

544
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,639
Must be nice.

545
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,243
Let me have it.

546
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,845
That life of yours.

547
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,448
Won't you?

548
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:54,498
Tomoya, did you ever
play catch with Rikiro?

549
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,669
What's with that question?

550
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,838
Can you throw a curveball?

551
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:10,281
My father vanished without a trace
when I was in grade school.

552
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,950
Mom and Dad got a divorce.

553
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,519
Let's both live respectable lives, okay?

554
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,622
He never taught me
that curveball like he promised.

555
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,895
I don't even know
whether he's alive or dead.

556
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,632
What I feel towards you

557
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,736
is envy.

558
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,407
Mr. Rikiro Endo

559
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,744
may be in a detention center,
but he's still alive.

560
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,115
You believed in your father's innocence

561
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,518
and tried to gather evidence
by making contact with Haruo Yamashita.

562
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,620
If I was you,

563
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,423
I couldn't have done all that.

564
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:59,163
That's why I am envious of you.

565
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:12,076
I will do what I can to allow you
a reunion with your father.

566
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,548
That's why I ask you to please trust me.

567
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,730
So? What did you want to talk about?

568
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,601
Uta Hayashikawa…

569
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,306
Am I her?

570
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,314
My father visited you here once, right?

571
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,316
What did you talk about with him?

572
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:58,989
Also, I heard that you
took in Uta after the incident.

573
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,426
Do you think…

574
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,431
I look similar to Uta Hayashikawa?

575
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,367
Uta and you?

576
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,503
You don't really look alike.

577
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,306
-The name's Tsujii!
-Please keep your voice low!

578
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,442
Your father only visited once

579
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,745
to check on Uta sometime
after the Higashikayama incident.

580
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:26,617
Then, could you tell me
where Uta Hayashikawa is?

581
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,220
We have a warrant for Tomoya Endo.

582
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,090
Got it.

583
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,360
Are you really doing your job?

584
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,596
Did I not clearly instruct you?

585
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,397
Not to let the public know about

586
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,834
the relation between Someda's death
and the Higashikayama case.

587
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,670
About that lawyer Matsukaze
who's defending Tomoya Endo.

588
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,339
Isn't he the son

589
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,308
of your former superior,

590
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,310
Mr. Kuze?

591
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,702
That man likely isn't the culprit.

592
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,242
Akazawa.

593
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,212
I'm always watching you.

594
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:40,824
Chief?

595
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,327
I'm calling it off.

596
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,731
What do you think's gotten into him?

597
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,437
Matsukaze, where's Mr. Kuze?

598
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,471
What?

599
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,741
Aren't you his son?

600
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,683
Then, could you tell me
where Uta Hayashikawa is?

601
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,821
Look, this is Uta.

602
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,037
She's studying abroad
at a university in Singapore.

603
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,708
Is that all you wanted?
Then leave already.

604
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,614
I knew it.

605
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,052
I'm not Uta Hayashikawa.

606
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,444
Knowing everything won't put you at ease.

607
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,378
I'll tell you.

608
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,947
-Still hiding something.
-Stop.

609
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,817
-That's enough!
-I still have to keep moving forward.

610
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,385
