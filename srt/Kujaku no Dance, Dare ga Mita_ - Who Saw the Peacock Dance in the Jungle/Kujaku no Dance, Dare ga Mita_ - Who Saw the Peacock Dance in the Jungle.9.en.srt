1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,975
I want you to live
a happy life as Komugi Yamashita.

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,679
It's okay for you to forget
that you used to be Uta Hayashikawa.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,585
Both Ms. Kyoko and Mr. Akazawa
are still hiding something.

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,589
That white fur matches the fur
of the dog that we took custody of

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:23,757
from the Awayama house.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,927
But I do know
that he's hiding something from us.

7
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,533
The house fire at that
former maternity hospital…

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,739
Do you have anything to do with it?

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,142
Dad.

10
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,449
Answer me, Dad!

11
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,189
I wonder when it was.

12
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:01,227
When did I start following the wrong path?

13
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,399
Was it back then?

14
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:22,282
All I wanted was to show you.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,887
I had never done anything for you.

16
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,662
I wanted you to see me fulfill
the role of a father.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,668
The court hereby sentences
the accused to death.

18
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,536
This court has found…

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:48,274
That was the moment we seized victory.

20
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,983
THIS CERTIFIES THAT YUKI ANAN
HAS COMPLETED HER APPRENTICESHIP

21
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,785
You did well.

22
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,055
I've made my decision.

23
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,692
I'll follow in your footsteps.

24
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,062
You will?

25
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,539
And 17 years later, you became…

26
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,374
TOKYO'S FIRST FEMALE DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR

27
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,145
She's overtaken me…

28
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,097
Hello. Who is this?

29
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,072
Where did I go wrong?

30
00:02:55,041 --> 00:03:00,680
A police officer named Haruo Yamashita
is reinvestigating the Higashikayama case?

31
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,383
But that's…

32
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,020
Rikiro Endo was the one behind that…

33
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,293
That can't be.

34
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,441
Then you're saying…

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,181
Rikiro Endo was actually…

36
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,118
innocent?

37
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,708
Just when was it that I chose

38
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,644
the wrong path?

39
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,859
YASUNARI HAYASHIKAWA'S ASSETS
ARE LISTED HEREIN

40
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,462
The Hayashikawa estate's asset list?

41
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,363
Yes.

42
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,633
Wait. Why do you have that, Komugi?

43
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,936
I got it from Mr. Tsujii.

44
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:35,008
Even if you say you're Uta Hayashikawa,
there's no inheritance left for you.

45
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,711
I'm sorry, but this is all I can give you.

46
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,284
LIST OF ASSETS

47
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,252
You went off on your own again?

48
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,157
Come on.
Let's go through the list together.

49
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,359
There might be a hint in these.

50
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,994
You're right. Let's look.

51
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,232
Look at all these pages.
So cool of the Hayashikawa family.

52
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,568
Real estate, stocks, cars, bank accounts.

53
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,605
Rightfully, all of this
would have gone to Komugi, huh?

54
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,042
But I stopped being Uta Hayashikawa.

55
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,247
Found her.

56
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,917
I found her!

57
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,886
Found who exactly?

58
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,495
LEASED TO IKUMI HIROSHIMA

59
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,064
Ikumi Hiroshima!

60
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,138
Ikumi Hiroshima.

61
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,074
That's the last name in the letter.

62
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,513
Our last lead.

63
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,481
What?

64
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,317
This is where Ikumi Hiroshima is.

65
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,553
What?

66
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,093
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

67
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,695
Yes?

68
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,165
The deputy chief prosecutor
wants to see you, Ms. Anan.

69
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,180
Sorry to call you out here
when you must be so very busy.

70
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,515
With all kinds of things.

71
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,516
What do you want?

72
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,784
I'll make it quick.

73
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,255
But it might make things
even busier for you.

74
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,457
Here.

75
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,730
That's a membership magazine
specifically for their wealthy clientele.

76
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,999
Only 5,000 copies
get printed for every issue.

77
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,535
It wasn't an easy thing
to get my hands on.

78
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,971
Like early editions
of Yoshiharu Tsuge's work.

79
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,274
Oh, about the page that will get you busy,

80
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,243
it's the one I've marked.

81
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,879
DIAMOND CLUB

82
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,550
See?

83
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,626
Where are you going?

84
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,663
I wonder where…

85
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,700
Superintendent,
we have to report something.

86
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,636
We think there's a possibility

87
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,174
that Chief Akazawa might be involved
in the deaths of the Awayama couple.

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,175
Akazawa?

89
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,476
Do you have proof?

90
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,348
This is the proof.

91
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,284
The day after the crime,

92
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,187
there was some dog fur
stuck to Chief Akazawa's suit.

93
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,957
That fur matches the fur of the dog
that the Awayama couple kept as a pet.

94
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,195
Superintendent?

95
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,598
-Bring Akazawa to me!
-Yes, sir!

96
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,701
How's the Tomoya Endo case going?

97
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,004
I'm trying to obtain decisive evidence.

98
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,072
Listen, Anan.

99
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,641
The chief prosecutor
is troubled by this case too.

100
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,346
Consider our position as the ones
who selected you to fill this post.

101
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,187
Who are you trying
to resolve this case for?

102
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,392
I understand.

103
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,064
I will prosecute Tomoya Endo.

104
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,106
Excuse me, my name is Yamashita.

105
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,476
I'm here to see Ikumi Ota.

106
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,744
Understood, ma'am.

107
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:38,184
Do you think my father came here too?

108
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,886
Most likely.

109
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,556
But how did you know she was here?

110
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,760
For the people in Haruo's letter
whose whereabouts were unknown,

111
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,863
I asked a detective agency
for help but they couldn't find her.

112
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,967
That made me think
she might be using a different name.

113
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,438
The last name of Ms. Hiroshima's mother
was Ota, and when I dug deeper…

114
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,741
You found this place.

115
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,211
Though it did take a lot of time.

116
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,379
Are you Ms. Yamashita?

117
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,451
Let's put you here.

118
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,558
Ms. Ikumi, you have a lot of guests today.

119
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,893
Please take your time.

120
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,930
It's nice to meet you.

121
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,365
I'm Komugi Yamashita.

122
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,604
Can I ask you a question?

123
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:37,677
Did a man named Haruo Yamashita
ever come to visit you here?

124
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,612
Wait.

125
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,849
He was my father.

126
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,521
Haruo?

127
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,728
If I may, Ms. Ikumi collapsed
due to a stroke a few years ago.

128
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,999
She started showing signs of dementia
after that and was hospitalized here.

129
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,336
I see.

130
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:08,007
Did a man in his 60s or 70s
ever come to visit her?

131
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,409
I'm afraid I don't know for sure.

132
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:15,247
But there's that one lady
who visits you every now and then, right?

133
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,582
Lady?

134
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:17,984
Yes.

135
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,152
Oka.

136
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,590
-What?
-Oka?

137
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,393
Oka.

138
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,132
Is Uta doing well?

139
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,435
What?

140
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,871
Why…

141
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,942
Why would Uta Hayashikawa's name…

142
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,616
HASAMI

143
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,486
Yes?

144
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,223
What?

145
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,027
Tomoya has been indicted?

146
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,366
Mr. Matsukaze,
I need to look into something.

147
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,634
I'll leave first.

148
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,069
What?

149
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:26,919
Once again,

150
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,258
I've added to my crimes.

151
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,765
Rikiro Endo was…

152
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,369
innocent.

153
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:49,375
I felt a strong sense
of unease in that moment.

154
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,410
If people knew

155
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:57,149
that I was the prosecutor responsible
for Rikiro Endo's wrongful conviction,

156
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,287
it might sully your career.

157
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:07,760
That's why I tried
to stop Haruo Yamashita.

158
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,667
Report Mr. Yamashita's
words and actions to you?

159
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
Why would I do that?

160
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:23,676
This is all to protect Mr. Yamashita.

161
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,245
And not just him.

162
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,181
His daughter might be in danger too.

163
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:37,089
I'll come again, so let me know then
whether you're willing to cooperate.

164
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,059
No, I--

165
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,494
Hey, wait!

166
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,333
KOHWADO CASTELLA

167
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,742
Alas,

168
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:03,449
it was that wish that led to that tragedy.

169
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,857
However,
Haruo Yamashita had left behind a letter.

170
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,692
Hello?

171
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,661
The police just came here.

172
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,733
Tell them that you were
the one who forged the letter.

173
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,335
If you do so…

174
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,173
The one who forged Mr. Yamashita's letter

175
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,941
is me.

176
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:35,414
I used drugs and money
to get Someda to give a false statement.

177
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,415
But…

178
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,317
Komugi!

179
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,753
-I'll wait here.
-What?

180
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,856
I have to let the regulars know
the shop's closed today.

181
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,899
I can't do it anymore.

182
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,534
I can't keep lying.

183
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,770
I understand.

184
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,841
Let's meet and talk.

185
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,413
And then,

186
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:14,019
I crossed a line that no one ever should.

187
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:25,731
I paid the dealers who had been
selling drugs to Someda and…

188
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,938
And yet, Komugi Yamashita

189
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,710
greatly surpassed
our expectations, didn't she?

190
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,411
That letter

191
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,916
was entrusted to me by my father.

192
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,786
What's your basis?

193
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,758
I can just tell.

194
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,160
That's my basis.

195
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:02,968
That's why I chose to approach her.

196
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,305
I'll lend you a hand.

197
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,041
I pretended to be an ally…

198
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,109
I'll be back tomorrow!

199
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,977
…as I spied on them.

200
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,315
To see how much of the truth
they had uncovered.

201
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,485
This wasn't supposed to happen!

202
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,921
You said I wouldn't
have to worry about Uta.

203
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:25,658
Why are there people
snooping around after all this time?

204
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,863
I believe you know what became of Someda.

205
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:36,835
Do you want to follow
the same path as him?

206
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,406
I wonder.

207
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,343
Where did I first go wrong?

208
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:59,491
It was too late for me to turn back.

209
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,296
AWAYAMA MATERNITY HOSPITAL

210
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,200
But please believe me.

211
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,872
All I wanted,

212
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:21,747
was for you to see me fulfill…

213
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,753
the role of a father.

214
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,123
That's all I wanted.

215
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,533
Did you need something?

216
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,306
Tomoya, you have been indicted.

217
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,576
Seems like it.

218
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,212
I'm sorry I couldn't prevent it.

219
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,815
I've submitted
an application for bail, but…

220
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,519
It probably won't get granted, will it?

221
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,791
Enough about that.

222
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,527
Any updates on my dad's case?

223
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,398
I did learn more about the case
from people related to it.

224
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,935
But I haven't managed to obtain
any evidence that would lead to a retrial.

225
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,409
However, every time I learn
new information from people,

226
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,245
my suspicion approaches certainty.

227
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,148
What suspicion?

228
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,054
That the two of you…

229
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,531
might be the victims in all this.

230
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,836
Let me promise you here and now.

231
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:56,875
I will let that certainty
guide me to the truth of this case.

232
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,487
What's the matter?

233
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,192
When I met him

234
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,630
for the first time in forever,
he said the same thing.

235
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,301
The two of you…

236
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,740
are victims.

237
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,280
That's what I believe, Tomoya.

238
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,921
Kamii.

239
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,628
HIGASHIKAYAMA POLICE STATION

240
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,639
Hi there.

241
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,308
Could we talk for a bit?

242
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,379
Certainly.

243
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,417
What's with the face?

244
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,453
You see a ghost or something?

245
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,588
I'm quite alive.

246
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,524
-Kamii is alive.
-Yasumura.

247
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,292
Wait, but…

248
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,461
What? Why?

249
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,330
Before I explain,
could you fill them in, Mr. Kamii?

250
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,965
Right, I'll do that.

251
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,103
I'm actually a childhood friend.

252
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,905
Whose?

253
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,574
Tomoya.

254
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,909
Tomoya Endo.

255
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,077
Really?

256
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,081
Well…

257
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,886
-You ready?
-Come at me.

258
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,354
Take this!

259
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,292
I told you that's not
how you do it, Kamii!

260
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,760
Throw the ball here.

261
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:00,065
You've got to hold the ball like this
when throwing a curveball, got it?

262
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,466
But I did hold it that way.

263
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,569
Just throw it, you brat.

264
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:05,904
Come on.

265
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,544
-Wow, it curved a bit!
-It sure did!

266
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,480
-Piss-poor, but still a curveball.
-What does that mean?

267
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,550
It's exactly like it sounds.
I knew you had it in you.

268
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,352
Now try it again.

269
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,023
He had a scary face,
but he was good at heart.

270
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,126
Well, he did steal here and there though.

271
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:30,963
And then…

272
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,936
And then that day came.

273
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,555
Wait, hang on.

274
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:01,093
So what? Did you become a reporter
to help Tomoya and Rikiro?

275
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,595
No, that would be too cheap of a motive.

276
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,163
Then why?

277
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,933
It was pure curiosity.

278
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,203
I just want to know…

279
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,075
the truth.

280
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,648
Well, let's get to business.

281
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,616
How about it?

282
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,185
Will you team up with me?

283
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,256
I've gotten so close to the truth.

284
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,125
It's almost within reach.

285
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,562
That's why I propose we share information.

286
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,630
How about it?

287
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,103
Before that, I'd like to apologize
for pestering you, Komugi.

288
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,372
I'm an adult, after all.

289
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,575
I apologize for my behavior.

290
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,879
I won't excuse it.

291
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,548
I won't forgive you,

292
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,285
not now or in the future.

293
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,055
That's harsh.

294
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,456
That said,

295
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,796
I also want to know.

296
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,100
Why did my father have to be killed?

297
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:20,939
That's why I will tolerate you.

298
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,710
After all, I'm an adult.

299
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,980
Did you change your personality
at some point?

300
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,250
The world calls that growth.

301
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,853
Sambo!

302
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,027
I've chosen to prosecute Tomoya Endo.

303
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,101
I see.

304
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,271
-I'll start preparing for trial--
-Yuki.

305
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:58,977
Yes?

306
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:00,912
What if…

307
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:06,885
Tomoya Endo wasn't the person
who killed Haruo Yamashita?

308
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,988
What would you do?

309
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,158
-What?
-Hypothetically speaking.

310
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,463
If that was the case,

311
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,300
the only option would be
to withdraw the charges.

312
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:26,071
Even though you might lose your position
as department supervisor?

313
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,773
Of course.

314
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,676
I am just a prosecutor in the end.

315
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,285
I had already gone astray

316
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:45,524
a very long time ago then.

317
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,929
All right, let's summarize
what we know so far.

318
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,231
After looking into Ikumi Hiroshima,

319
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,935
we learned that she was the head
of a company named Wood River Water.

320
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:02,441
And Ms. Ikumi looked at you
and said Oka, is that correct?

321
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,508
Yes.

322
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,477
And then…

323
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,113
Is Uta doing well?

324
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,618
Ms. Hiroshima knew about Uta Hayashikawa.

325
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,423
Can I tell you a story
that might get a bit long?

326
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,358
I'd prefer it if you keep it concise.

327
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,428
Guess what?

328
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:28,400
I used to have correspondence with Rikiro.

329
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,468
Correspondence?

330
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,802
That's right.

331
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,539
And he once told me something peculiar.

332
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,475
What?

333
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:40,045
If Rikiro really was the killer,

334
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,349
why did he leave
only Uta Hayashikawa alive?

335
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,987
It never quite made sense to me.

336
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,925
But then, Rikiro himself gave me a hint.

337
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,362
In this.

338
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,935
FROM RIKIRO ENDO

339
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,211
TO TAKASHI KAMII

340
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,116
"When the police started questioning me,
I kept quiet about one thing."

341
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,152
On that day,

342
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:25,624
I lost to temptation and snuck onto
the Hayashikawa's garden

343
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,260
so I could steal something from the house.

344
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,165
The house should have been empty,
but I heard sounds coming from inside.

345
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,145
When I took a look after some time,

346
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,314
I saw Mr. Yasunari in front of the house,

347
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:54,452
along with a woman who wasn't his wife
holding a baby in her hands.

348
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,688
What?

349
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,459
After that,

350
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,232
I heard a baby's cries
from the first floor.

351
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,368
It continued for quite some time.

352
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,530
I immediately called the police.

353
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,600
The baby was on the first floor.

354
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,070
-Are you certain about that?
-Yes.

355
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,107
Mr. Yamashita, Mr. Akazawa,
I found a survivor.

356
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,310
It's a child. Or rather, a baby.

357
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,346
That's false.

358
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,481
The baby was on the second floor.

359
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,550
I saw it myself.

360
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,452
What?

361
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:04,956
And about the woman you saw
with Mr. Yasunari who wasn't his wife,

362
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,159
did you just make her up to throw us off?

363
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,999
I'm sure the woman I saw wasn't his wife,

364
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:18,603
and that the baby's cries
came from the first floor.

365
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,840
Was that baby…

366
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,044
I'd wager it was probably Uta Hayashikawa.

367
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,513
Which is to say…

368
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,282
You can guess.

369
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,454
Wait, if what Rikiro said is true,

370
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:39,024
then who was the woman
holding Uta at that time?

371
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,994
I'm willing to bet it was Oka.

372
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,264
Wait.

373
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,467
I mean, do you think anyone
would ask if Uta was doing well

374
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,871
to someone
who wasn't part of Uta's family?

375
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,241
But if that's true,

376
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,081
could this Oka be… Komugi's mother?

377
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,851
I'd say that's a likely possibility.

378
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,422
Why did you keep something
this important a secret until now?

379
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,891
Isn't it obvious?

380
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,695
You save your trump card until the end.

381
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,899
You know what?

382
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,702
I can't trust you after all.

383
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,707
-What's so funny?
-It's just…

384
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,811
Why would you so easily
trust people in the first place?

385
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,913
What…

386
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:39,751
From the cradle to the grave,
are you not always alone?

387
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,152
Alone the whole time!

388
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,254
No matter who it is,

389
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,824
you can never fully
understand another person.

390
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,927
Whether you're related by blood or not.

391
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:49,828
Am I wrong?

392
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,631
There's a deluge of information
swirling around in the world.

393
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,103
Which of them is real and which is fake?

394
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,738
Who can tell the difference?

395
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,677
You can never know
what someone is hiding inside here.

396
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:10,648
How can you ever trust
everything a person says?

397
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,718
Then do you not trust
Rikiro's letter either?

398
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,786
I trust it.

399
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:16,921
What?

400
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,791
What are you…

401
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,762
I trust this while putting
my life on the line.

402
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,299
If this is a lie,

403
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,136
I'll probably get lost
deep inside a forest.

404
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,872
Maybe I'll never get out of it.

405
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,341
Maybe going deeper
will lead me to a cliff.

406
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:41,112
But I can assure you, I'm prepared for it.

407
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,114
I'm betting my life on it!

408
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,920
TO KOMUGI

409
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,322
That's why,

410
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,360
even if it leads me to hell,

411
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,096
I'll move forward.

412
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,771
Are you not the same?

413
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,342
I already…

414
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,347
prepared myself long ago.

415
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,419
Is that so?

416
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,355
Then we're in the same boat.

417
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,127
Have a look at this.

418
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,262
The page with the marker.

419
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,751
Ms. Kyoko.

420
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,887
KYOKO AKAZAWA,
AN OLD FRIEND OF MS. HIROSHIMA

421
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,892
You know,
I showed this to Mr. Akazawa too.

422
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,828
His expression looked
much like yours right now.

423
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,131
What…

424
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:08,867
Now then,

425
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:15,240
Ms. Ikumi Hiroshima and Ms. Kyoko Akazawa

426
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,976
have known each other for a long time.

427
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:21,746
Hey.

428
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,682
Don't you get the feeling

429
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,553
that the Akazawa couple
is hiding something big?

430
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,023
And never tell Akazawa
or anyone else about this.

431
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,226
Keep it a secret between you and me.

432
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:43,201
Apparently, his wife once left
the house with their child.

433
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,272
My father also said
they lived separately for a period.

434
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,907
See?

435
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:56,314
Now, what if Ms. Kyoko's maiden name
contained "Oka" in it?

436
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,619
That would mean Oka is…

437
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,725
Ms. Kyoko?

438
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:13,197
Which would mean
the one who gave birth to you…

439
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,671
That can't be.

440
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,241
Uta Hayashikawa's mother was…

441
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:34,452
Komugi, can you get in touch
with Mr. Akazawa's son?

442
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,822
-What?
-There has to be more.

443
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,592
Let's confirm what
Kyoko Akazawa's maiden name is.

444
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,475
Hello. Komugi?

445
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,876
Hey, Mamoru.

446
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,212
Sorry for the sudden call.

447
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,614
Hey,

448
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,185
can I ask you something?

449
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,888
Do you happen to know
Ms. Kyoko's maiden name?

450
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:11,856
What?

451
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,858
I'll go back first, Akazawa.

452
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,828
Well…

453
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,063
Yoshi…

454
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:21,899
It's Yoshioka.

455
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,703
Yoshi…

456
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,773
Oka?

457
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,081
You're a strong girl, Komugi.

458
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,250
It's okay.

459
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,718
It will all be okay.

460
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,288
Oh, one more thing.

461
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,356
Here.

462
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,225
Wow, it's Kou.

463
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,227
Look. We have matching ones.

464
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:54,332
I want you to live
a happy life as Komugi Yamashita.

465
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,569
It's okay for you to forget
that you used to be Uta Hayashikawa.

466
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,806
Mr. Matsukaze.

467
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,481
Let's move forward.

468
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,223
Let's go…

469
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,128
find the peacock.

470
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,768
All right.

471
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,578
Hey.

472
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,583
Can I ask you just one thing?

473
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,052
I've made my decision.

474
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,054
I'll follow in your footsteps.

475
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,660
Why did you say that you wanted

476
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,231
to follow in the footsteps
of someone like me?

477
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,235
I treated your mother…

478
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:44,876
No, I treated both of you
in a deplorable way.

479
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,081
Tell me.

480
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,151
Why did you say that?

481
00:35:59,023 --> 00:35:59,924
Out of hate.

482
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,130
It was out of hate for you.

483
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,736
I decided to see it through to the end.

484
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,472
Where your path leads.

485
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,542
As your daughter.

486
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,978
To the end.

487
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,221
Why was I born to you?

488
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,925
For what reason?

489
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,832
No matter how I might try…

490
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:52,410
I can't change the fact
that you are the only father I have.

491
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:19,570
You must not… go that way.

492
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,614
Sorry?

493
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:33,884
Nothing…

494
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,854
I'll call you later.

495
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,297
DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR

496
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,537
No answer from
Ms. Kyoko's landline phone either.

497
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,839
Where did she go?

498
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,443
Why don't we ask this?

499
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,611
What's that?

500
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,647
A GPS tracker.

501
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,582
-A GPS tracker?
-On Ms. Kyoko?

502
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,285
No, on her husband.

503
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,188
DIAMOND CLUB

504
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,356
See?

505
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,165
Where are you going?

506
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,467
I'm good with my hands.

507
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,903
Rikiro's lessons paid off.

508
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,607
Is Mr. Akazawa headed towards…

509
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,911
Who is it that Melos runs for?

510
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,348
Why don't we go find out?

511
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,485
Let's go.

512
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,488
-Really?
-No.

513
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,024
Not bad.

514
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,693
Dad, wait!

515
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,328
Let's go back there.

516
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,367
Yes!

517
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,406
Let's play red light, green light.

518
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,941
Red light, green light? Okay.

519
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:05,943
-Who will be it?
-You will.

520
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,713
I'm It? Okay, let's go with that.

521
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,181
You ready?

522
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,052
Red light…

523
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,342
I can't let her…

524
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,216
follow in these footsteps.

525
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:48,919
I can't.

526
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,267
She's going to be so happy.

527
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,569
-She is.
-Right?

528
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,638
-Uta?
-Uta.

529
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:09,907
Hey.

530
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,276
Let's go visit tons of places together.

531
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,212
-Oh, she just smiled.
-Was that an answer?

532
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,852
Where the hell is Akazawa?
You still haven't found him?

533
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,487
We don't know where he is--

534
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,356
-I don't care! Find him!
-Yes, sir!

535
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,259
You too, Nishijin!
I don't care where. Just find him!

536
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,427
Yes, sir!

537
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,997
-You damn idiot!
-Sorry, sir!

538
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,000
-Big news!
-Did you find Akazawa?

539
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,768
No, I haven't found him yet.

540
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,970
-What the hell are you doing?
-This is more important.

541
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:41,605
The culprit…

542
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,040
The culprit just--

543
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,775
What?

544
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,814
I was the one…

545
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,752
responsible for all of it.

546
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:01,091
I will confess to all my crimes.

547
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,760
This is the place.

548
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,165
The Hayashikawa residence?

549
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,833
Let's go in.

550
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,791
HAYASHIKAWA

551
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,363
Is everything you just said true?

552
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:14,965
Yes.

553
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,202
Someone you know?

554
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,538
No.

555
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,375
Susumu Someda,

556
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,511
Kyoichiro Awayama,

557
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,517
and his wife, Manoka.

558
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,052
I was the one…

559
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,658
who killed them.

560
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,817
What about the murder of Haruo Yamashita?

561
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,486
Was it you?

562
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,524
-You did it, didn't you?
-Answer!

563
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,373
What?

564
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,536
The one who killed Haruo Yamashita…

565
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,178
is not me.

566
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,849
