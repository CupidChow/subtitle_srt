1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,773
On the night of Christmas Eve,

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,977
my father was murdered by someone.

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,880
The person arrested as the primary suspect

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,049
was Tomoya Endo.

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:21,855
Tomoya was the son of Rikiro Endo,
a man who received the death penalty

6
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:26,359
for murdering a family
22 years ago in Higashikayama.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,899
However, my father left me a letter
that spoke of false accusations.

8
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,836
I trusted my father's letter

9
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:40,373
and sought to uncover the truth
alongside a lawyer named Matsukaze.

10
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,375
But then…

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,311
The one who forged Mr. Yamashita's letter…

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,380
is me.

13
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,392
Yes.

14
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:04,364
I received word from Someda just now
that the police had shown up at his place.

15
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:16,976
Someda will say that he forged the letter
under the orders of Tomoya Endo.

16
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,080
Yes, of course.

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,683
Someda is of no further use.

18
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,952
It's fine.

19
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:30,056
Nothing problematic has gotten out.

20
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,359
Is that so.

21
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,297
Someda should have known
better than anyone.

22
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,201
There are some things better left unknown.

23
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,408
Mr. Yamashita…

24
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,315
Why did it… turn out like this?

25
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,556
Hello!

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,892
-Mr. Someda!
-Huh?

27
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,027
-The person from the bank is here.
-Okay!

28
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:12,198
Mr. Someda, if your son
ever decides to inherit your business,

29
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,601
investing now will benefit him too.

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,276
SOMEDA TATAMI MAT STORE
DIRECTOR, SUSUMU SOMEDA

31
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,648
STAMP

32
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,317
I'm home!

33
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,587
Satoru!

34
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,456
How are you, Satoru?

35
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,590
Come here.

36
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,494
Up you go. Welcome home!

37
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,296
Back then,

38
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:49,369
I thought those happy times
would last forever.

39
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:55,308
More and more businesses are going
bankrupt due to failed investments.

40
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,112
Experts say they expect
the bubble's collapse to accelerate.

41
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,481
Sir, you have a call.

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,617
Yes?

43
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,488
That can't be…

44
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,633
I'm sorry for missing your payroll again.

45
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,636
I'm so sorry!

46
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,105
This is why we all objected to it.

47
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,008
-What are we supposed to do now?
-I'm sorry.

48
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:47,227
My father started that tatami mat store
and I caused it to go under.

49
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,728
PROPERTY FOR SALE

50
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,862
And on that day…

51
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,136
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

52
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,738
I'd like some flowers.

53
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,974
Today's our wedding anniversary.

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,275
Congratulations.

55
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,844
Thank you for your purchase.

56
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,882
I have to say it.

57
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,018
It's going to be tough from now,

58
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,222
but would you please stay with me?

59
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,669
Guess I should have the talk first.

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,074
I'm home.

61
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,211
Welcome back.

62
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,215
-Look, I--
-Don't you have something to say?

63
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,620
This came in from the court today.

64
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,628
You took out a loan
with our house as collateral?

65
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,899
You're always like this.

66
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,769
Why don't you ever tell me anything?

67
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,839
I had my mind made up, you know.

68
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,579
If the first thing you said
when you came home was about this,

69
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,750
I'd forgive you if you told me
everything of your own accord.

70
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,488
If you apologized and asked me to stay…

71
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,389
Wait.

72
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,591
-Hear me out.
-Hear what out?

73
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,960
Will it change anything if I do?

74
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,701
I just can't stay with you anymore.

75
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,871
The one who forged Mr. Yamashita's letter…

76
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,207
is me.

77
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,115
Mr. Yamashita…

78
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,253
I'm so…

79
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,099
Someda admitted to it
as soon as you came in, sir.

80
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,068
He must've sensed he couldn't fool you.

81
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,406
No, it's all thanks to you
for softening him up beforehand, Akisada.

82
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,108
Good job.

83
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,244
Thank you, sir.

84
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,480
Now, if only Tomoya Endo
would talk just as easily.

85
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,648
Yeah.

86
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,851
-Chief, you're drinking that water again?
-Yeah.

87
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm told it's good for my body.

88
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,255
By your wife?

89
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,060
Pretty much.

90
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,231
TOMOYA ENDO

91
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,037
That'll do it.

92
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,340
Starting now,
I will take full responsibility

93
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,343
and represent you as your defense counsel.

94
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,848
If you ever need assistance,
don't hesitate to call me.

95
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,318
Also, I listened to it.

96
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,754
Listened?

97
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,990
-Listened to what?
-The recording.

98
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,494
He gave it to you?

99
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,833
The person you were talking to
was Mr. Haruo Yamashita, correct?

100
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,302
Can't you tell just by looking?

101
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,504
Just by looking?

102
00:07:55,575 --> 00:08:00,379
I'm sorry. I deeply regret
what I've done to you, Tomoya.

103
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,483
I'm afraid I couldn't tell
from the voice alone.

104
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,353
Why'd he go and do that?

105
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,488
Do what?

106
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,756
There's a video.

107
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,892
He should have it.

108
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,197
A video of me and Haruo Yamashita talking.

109
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,802
Then,

110
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,206
what I heard was only
the audio from that recording?

111
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,845
Going off your reaction,

112
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,314
I guess that means…

113
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,786
you didn't see the most important thing.

114
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,795
-Chief.
-What?

115
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,100
That lawyer, Matsukaze, has officially
become Tomoya's defense attorney.

116
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,251
-Yes? Anan speaking.
-There's been a development.

117
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,520
We did another round
of questioning with Someda,

118
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,290
who owns the ramen stall
that Mr. Yamashita frequented.

119
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,261
He admitted to forging the letter
under the direction of Tomoya Endo.

120
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,498
I see.

121
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,300
Someda did?

122
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:31,304
Someda already talked.
It won't be long until Tomoya does.

123
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,272
Besides that,

124
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,208
there's another concerning matter.

125
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,878
What is it?

126
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,414
A lawyer came in contact with Someda.

127
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,617
His name is Yoshiteru Matsukaze.

128
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,387
He's the lawyer mentioned
in Mr. Yamashita's letter.

129
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,524
I think he might be involved
in this case somehow.

130
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:56,362
This Matsukaze guy is now
officially Tomoya's defense attorney.

131
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,431
I see.

132
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,137
Let's see how things play out for now.

133
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,942
Are you moving to rearrest
Tomoya Endo on a murder charge?

134
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,611
I should hope you are.

135
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,113
Yes.

136
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,949
We're trying to do exactly that.

137
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,751
Goodbye then.

138
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,630
Why'd you have to interfere?

139
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,840
Hello?

140
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,477
Um, I just wanted to know how it went.

141
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,847
I got Tomoya Endo to sign
the document assigning me as his counsel.

142
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,215
However…

143
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,783
However, what?

144
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,753
It's a bit complicated.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

145
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,755
Wait, now you've made me curious.

146
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,757
I'll come over there.

147
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,626
Don't. It'll be the same
whether I tell you today or tomorrow.

148
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,362
-Just wait until then.
-No.

149
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,399
Don't make this difficult.

150
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,701
What would you do in my position?

151
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,504
"It's complicated. Wait until tomorrow."
Would you wait?

152
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,940
Try to answer me using
your non-existent imagination.

153
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,610
I would… wait.

154
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,079
That's a lie. You're a liar. A dirty liar!

155
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,154
LIAR!

156
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,055
LIAR!

157
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,189
LIAT!

158
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,090
LIAR!

159
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,459
Jeez, calm down.

160
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,495
LIAR!

161
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,374
ARISA
MUGI, YOU ALRIGHT? DOING OKAY?

162
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,654
I'M DOING OKAY

163
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,029
CAN WE MEET?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

164
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,166
OPEN

165
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,236
Welcome.

166
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,971
Sorry for being late.

167
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:25,211
I took a bus, you see,
and it got stuck in some terrible traffic.

168
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,514
It's tough being poor.

169
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,151
Us poor reporters can't even take taxis.

170
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,221
-Why did you--
-Right.

171
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,225
If it's about me not sending
everything I had, that's my bad.

172
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,864
It's just, you know,
I'm a poor little reporter, after all.

173
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,501
If I showed all my cards,
I bet you wouldn't even give me

174
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,336
the time of day.

175
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,905
Hand over the recorded footage.

176
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,344
Can I order first?

177
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,579
-Welcome.
-A caffè latte, please.

178
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,682
Draw a rabbit with the foam, if you would.

179
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,117
Sorry?

180
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,953
Come on now. It's a joke.
Just trying to be funny.

181
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,789
I'm not here to make small talk.

182
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,691
Hand over the recorded footage!

183
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,963
-That's all for my order.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,668
Now that I'm his attorney,
I can't let him be prosecuted so easily.

185
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,304
Time is of the essence.

186
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,508
Do you have to look so scary?
Could be a poster for The Grudge.

187
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:34,446
Mr. Kamii, it seems to me
that you've gained Tomoya Endo's trust,

188
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,417
but you must know there's limits
to what a mere reporter can do.

189
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,222
You know, have you ever been told

190
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,258
that you're kind of a pompous ass?

191
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,195
What?

192
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,231
Oh my, you're not even self-aware?

193
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,733
That's a severe case!

194
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,802
A word of advice.

195
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,673
If you keep that up,
you'll never get anything out of anyone.

196
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:06,679
Me, I first build a firm foundation
with whoever I'm talking to.

197
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,282
I make sure to be sincere
with them. Real sincere.

198
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,318
And then,

199
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,487
I ever so smoothly get them to talk.

200
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,595
Does the way you treat Komugi
also count as being sincere?

201
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,130
-Of course--
-Absolutely not!

202
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,334
All you did was cause confusion.

203
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,805
It's still not clear
if that DNA test was even true.

204
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,675
It seems to me that you're
deliberately trying to confuse her,

205
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,646
perhaps for some other objective.

206
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,752
You claimed that the surviving child
of the Hayashikawa family

207
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,888
from 22 years ago is actually Komugi.

208
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:54,293
Komugi and Uta Hayashikawa
have different ages and birthdays.

209
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,564
She's already quite unsettled.

210
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,401
If you plan to keep confusing
her with baseless claims,

211
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,371
then I frankly don't care
about being called a pompous ass.

212
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,673
I will take action to protect her.

213
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,490
I know all that already.

214
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,226
About the birthdays and everything.

215
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,929
I said it all despite knowing.

216
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,432
Stop being so condescending,
you damn lawyer!

217
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,736
It really pisses me off.

218
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,239
That patronizing look.

219
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,792
Well, it's still true that I want
to get along with you two.

220
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,561
I'll show it to you,
as a way to make amends.

221
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,899
The video footage of Tomoya Endo
talking with Haruo Yamashita.

222
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,970
Here's your order.

223
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,676
So what did you want to talk about?

224
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,278
Yeah, about that.

225
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,246
The thing is,

226
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,616
the faculty of law makes
us do practical training,

227
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,919
so I attended some hearings in court.

228
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,121
And while I was there,

229
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,826
I met your dad at the court.

230
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,963
Mugi's dad?

231
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,704
You met Dad?

232
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,008
He was at the court?

233
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:50,909
But why?

234
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,412
I don't know that part.

235
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,915
But… I met him a few times.

236
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,551
What?

237
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,355
One of those times, he talked
to me about that one incident.

238
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,893
I'm really grateful to you, Arisa.

239
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,463
For when you two were in grade school.

240
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,832
Who did this?

241
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,370
What happened, Emi? Are you all right?

242
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,639
Someone cut up her scarf.

243
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,108
Did you do it, Komugi?

244
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:27,479
Komugi told me that you
stayed friends with her

245
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,314
after that scarf incident.

246
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:38,590
She'd probably have stopped
going to school if it wasn't for you.

247
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,959
She said so.

248
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,228
Mugi did?

249
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,573
I have to apologize to you.

250
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,077
I actually…

251
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,617
Komugi's so annoying,
always acting nice and obedient.

252
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,453
She sure is.

253
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,688
Hey, Emi.

254
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,324
Was it really okay to cut your own scarf?

255
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,359
It's fine.

256
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,596
Mom buys me new ones all the time.

257
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,497
What?

258
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,673
It was all orchestrated by Emi.

259
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,177
I found out the truth,

260
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,313
but Emi and her group threatened me.

261
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:40,018
I was too scared of them targeting me.

262
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,189
I told your dad about it.

263
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,725
And then he said…

264
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,329
I want to thank you…

265
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,133
for telling me.

266
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,936
It must've been tough.

267
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:09,848
I'm glad Komugi has such a good friend.

268
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,189
He said that to me.

269
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,993
Even after learning how I acted.

270
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,697
Mugi,

271
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,300
I'm really sorry.

272
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,807
What?

273
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,744
But why?

274
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,746
Because…

275
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,952
I was happy.

276
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,256
And also,

277
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:58,564
I finally found out that
the peacock really did dance.

278
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,499
The peacock danced?

279
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,635
Don't worry about it.

280
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,371
Arisa.

281
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,376
Thanks for telling me everything.

282
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,687
Wait, is this…

283
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,590
Yup, where we are right now.

284
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,532
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,804
I deeply regret

286
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:45,177
what I've done to you, Tomoya.

287
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,116
-I'm so sorry.
-What exactly are you apologizing for?

288
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,187
I'm asking you what the hell
you're apologizing for!

289
00:20:55,254 --> 00:21:00,325
I've wronged both Rikiro
and Mr. Hayashikawa as well.

290
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,561
And what will you do about it?

291
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:11,703
I'll borrow Mr. Kamii's help,
and I'll disclose everything.

292
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,415
At the time,

293
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,919
I was a part of the investigation
for the Higashikayama case.

294
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:34,493
Your father ended up becoming a suspect,

295
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,062
and ultimately confessed to the crime.

296
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:43,302
But when Rikiro
received his death sentence…

297
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,874
I thought…

298
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,315
A certain thought began to plague my mind.

299
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,916
This is where it gets good.

300
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:03,221
Your father, Rikiro,

301
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,958
is not the person…

302
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,562
that's responsible…

303
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,167
for the murders.

304
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,846
See? Isn't that some good stuff?

305
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,550
If that's true,

306
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,887
then go announce that
in a press conference or whatever else.

307
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,857
Well, I would do that if I could.

308
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,561
Right now, I'm trying to gather proof.

309
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,430
-You're just gonna feign ignorance?!
-That's not it.

310
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,768
Mr. Kamii, please--

311
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,205
That's it?

312
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,276
I promised Haruo
I'd only film the apology.

313
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,813
-Is that actually true?
-It is! I swear.

314
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,718
Well, I hope you get the idea now.

315
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,022
Komugi is more than just
the daughter of a murder victim.

316
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,726
She's central to the Higashikayama case.

317
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,363
My guess is that Haruo

318
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,534
figured out who the true culprit was.

319
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,476
These are all the days
I met your dad at court.

320
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,779
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

321
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,050
Mugi, would you please stay
my friend from now on too?

322
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,020
Of course.

323
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,190
-Don't you have a seminar next?
-Oh, right.

324
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,630
-Later then, Mugi.
-Later.

325
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,242
Dad…

326
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,380
what were you doing in court?

327
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,755
So it growls even at a time like this.

328
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,458
Proof that I'm alive.

329
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,760
Right.

330
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,376
Too early, I guess.

331
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,348
That's not what we agreed to!

332
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,351
Please wait! I did what you asked!

333
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,487
Hello?!

334
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,194
Mr. Someda?

335
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,031
Mr. Someda.

336
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,133
Oh, Komugi.

337
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,436
Did something happen?

338
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,304
No, nothing at all.

339
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,507
Really?

340
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,009
Really.

341
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,215
Okay then.

342
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,185
That's good.

343
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,632
Mr. Someda?

344
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,135
Hey, Mr. Someda?

345
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,570
Komugi…

346
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,773
I've done something unthinkable.

347
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,841
What?

348
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,609
What happened?

349
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,415
I betrayed…

350
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,552
Mr. Yamashita.

351
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,691
I've wasted my life.

352
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,893
All of it.

353
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:12,237
My company went under,
and my wife and child left me.

354
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,875
I tried to kill myself.

355
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,246
IF TRAPPED PLEASE GET OUT

356
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,749
But… I couldn't do it.

357
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,688
When I was at rock bottom…

358
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,523
Are you all right, mister?

359
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,394
A young man I'd just met heard me out.

360
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,129
Thanks a lot.

361
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,567
I was ready to die just moments ago,
but I feel better now.

362
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,035
Don't try that again, okay?

363
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,807
Life just doesn't go the way you want.

364
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,344
Look, I have special something for you.

365
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,080
ROWAZO

366
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,852
Wait, is this…

367
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,758
Just hear me out.

368
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,930
If your life keeps refusing
to go your way, just try it out.

369
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,834
It will help you feel better.

370
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,215
Did you take it?

371
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,226
Once you get addicted,

372
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,195
it's over.

373
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,210
Nice work.

374
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,013
I had to pay for the drugs,

375
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,617
so I did as I was told,
creating counterfeit products

376
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,053
and forging signatures.

377
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,235
Satoru?

378
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,072
Satoru!

379
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,408
Satoru!

380
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,745
I'm from the police station.

381
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,448
You're Mr. Susumu Someda, correct?

382
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,386
You're under arrest for violating
the Unfair Competition Prevention Law.

383
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,256
You can leave.

384
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,635
I'll be handling your questioning.

385
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,270
I'm Yamashita.

386
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,075
Man, it sure is hot today.

387
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,878
Don't you think?

388
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,682
I'd love some hot ramen
on a day like this.

389
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:16,321
Doesn't it feel great to eat
some hot ramen on a hot day…

390
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,559
and just sweat away the heat?

391
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,900
That was how I met Mr. Yamashita.

392
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,809
I'll admit to everything.

393
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,713
I'm sorry.

394
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,183
I'll stop doing drugs.

395
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,791
I see.

396
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,064
But well,

397
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,636
looking at your state now,
I don't think that's gonna happen.

398
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,070
Huh?

399
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,606
I'll make a prediction.

400
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,876
You'll do the same thing again.

401
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,648
What would you know, fucking bastard?!

402
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,516
Get off your damn high horse!

403
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,090
Sit down.

404
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,727
Of course,

405
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,933
I have no way of knowing
what it's like to be in your shoes.

406
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,068
Then what gives you the right to preach?!

407
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,770
I may not be able to know,

408
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,541
but I want to see you

409
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:48,980
have some hope in your life.

410
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,950
I'd love to see that…

411
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,786
Mr. Someda.

412
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:01,259
It's strange, but those words,

413
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:05,496
they just stuck with me.

414
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,270
I got out of prison two years later.

415
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,774
His words stayed with me the entire time.

416
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,077
Somewhere deep inside me,

417
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:24,415
that hope Mr. Yamashita
talked about planted itself.

418
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,051
But you know,

419
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,790
having to fight
the cravings was like torture.

420
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:48,907
I want to see you
have some hope in your life.

421
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:56,080
A few years after that,
when I'd started a food stall…

422
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,582
Hello there.

423
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,654
Really?

424
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,156
Thank you!

425
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,792
Are you open?

426
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,362
Looking good.

427
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,970
DELICIOUSNESS GUARANTEED
RAMEN

428
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,817
That really hit the spot.
I'm surprised it's actually good.

429
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,955
Is that really a compliment?

430
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,398
-What's with the laugh?
-No, it's just…

431
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,537
I just felt kind of happy
after eating that delicious ramen.

432
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,076
I feel like I'm the younger brother
that has his act together,

433
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,446
and I'm watching
my elder brother trying his best.

434
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,248
That's awfully one-sided of you.

435
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,160
Wow, really? You have a child now?

436
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,830
-How old is she?
-How old are you?

437
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:19,897
I am five.

438
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,166
-Yeah, she's five.
-Five.

439
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,067
You like ramen?

440
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:27,238
I like ramen, but I like
curry and fish cakes more.

441
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,741
Right after curry and fish cakes, huh?

442
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,643
She eats a lot so she grows
faster than other children.

443
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,379
That's a good thing.

444
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,249
Mr. Yamashita showed me

445
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,855
the next stage of a family,
that I couldn't experience for myself.

446
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,359
And yet, I said

447
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:56,634
that I forged Mr. Yamashita's letter
under Tomoya Endo's orders.

448
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:00,938
I lied.

449
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,407
What?

450
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,245
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Komugi.

451
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,913
Wait, but then…

452
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:14,585
Does that mean the letter…

453
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,856
really was written by Dad?

454
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,962
Why did you lie, Mr. Someda?

455
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,935
Did someone tell you to?

456
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,707
Report Mr. Yamashita's
words and actions to you?

457
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,376
Why would I do that?

458
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:45,650
This is all to protect Mr. Yamashita.

459
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,419
And not just him.

460
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,456
His daughter might be in danger too.

461
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:58,696
I'll come again, so let me know then
whether you're willing to cooperate.

462
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:00,798
No, I--

463
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,333
Hey, wait!

464
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,072
CASTELLA

465
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,543
10 MILLION YEN

466
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,068
Tell me, Mr. Someda!

467
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,103
I can't.

468
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,738
What?

469
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,473
If I do,

470
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,145
you'll be dragged into this.

471
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,317
I think I'll close shop.

472
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,953
Please, let's go to the police again.

473
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,688
I'll come with you!

474
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,259
We'll get Mr. Matsukaze to come too.

475
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,463
The police won't just ignore you
if you have a lawyer present.

476
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,767
Mr. Someda!

477
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,970
I want to…

478
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,507
keep coming here forever!

479
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,810
I want to keep eating your ramen!

480
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:30,221
I don't want to lose
anything else important to me.

481
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,124
Komugi…

482
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,459
Promise me, Mr. Someda.

483
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,532
Promise me you won't go anywhere.

484
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,708
Okay.

485
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,578
I promise.

486
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,260
Hello.

487
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,829
-Teru.
-Yeah?

488
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,065
-Big news.
-About your glasses again?

489
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,132
What? No.

490
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,902
It's about one of the names
in the letter, Tatsuo Mikita.

491
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,036
What about it?

492
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,340
He was a part of the defense counsel.

493
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,475
-For what?
-The Higashikayama case!

494
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,543
What?

495
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,979
Remember to stay cool!

496
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,988
The office is on the seventh floor here.

497
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,702
Komugi!

498
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,471
I'll wait here.

499
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,538
What?

500
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,942
I have to let the regulars know
the shop's closed today.

501
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,845
-I'll bring Mr. Matsukaze here then.
-Okay.

502
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,748
RIKIRO ENDO'S DEFENCE LAWYER
IN THE HIGASHIYAMA CASE

503
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,353
That's a shocker, isn't it?

504
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,856
Wouldn't have guessed
he defended Rikiro Endo.

505
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,626
What do we do? Take an appointment?

506
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,996
-Quick and cool, that's the rule.
-I'll ignore that, but yeah.

507
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,231
Roger.

508
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,433
-Mr. Matsukaze!
-There she is.

509
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,137
Would you please
come to the police with me?

510
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,476
He lied about forging the letter
at Tomoya Endo's command?

511
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,980
But he couldn't tell me why he did it.

512
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,748
Because it would drag me in.

513
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,750
Is there someone pulling the strings?

514
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,820
-Where's Mr. Someda?
-Down at the entrance.

515
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,894
Komugi, I should tell you

516
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,964
that Kamii gave me a video
of your father talking with Tomoya Endo.

517
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,666
What?

518
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,703
Your father made
a clear statement in the video.

519
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,874
That Rikiro Endo was not the culprit
behind the Higashikayama case.

520
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,949
My guess is that Haruo
knew the truth behind the case.

521
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:20,458
There's a saying that goes,
"Who saw the peacock dance in the jungle?"

522
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,126
SON OF DEATH ROW INMATE ARRESTED

523
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,102
Right now, our only lead
for getting to the jungle

524
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,937
is Mr. Someda.

525
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:40,945
Mr. Someda!

526
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,783
Mr. Someda?

527
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,957
-He's not here.
-What?

528
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,125
Wait…

529
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,138
Where did he go?

530
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,179
I'm sorry, Chief.

531
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,648
I followed them to the building
where Matsukaze's office is,

532
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,184
but I lost sight of Someda.

533
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,420
What the hell were you doing?

534
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,289
Go find him.

535
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,558
Find him right now!

536
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,726
Yes, sir!

537
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,498
Hey, wait! Jolly!

538
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,535
Jolly!

539
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,538
-Did you find him?
-No.

540
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:55,019
KOMUGI

541
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,436
I'm sorry, Komugi.

542
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,178
KOMUGI

543
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,014
Urgent message from
Higashikayama North One to the MPD.

544
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:28,052
We discovered an unconscious elderly man
floating in the Edo River during patrol.

545
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:28,953
I repeat.

546
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,421
Higashikayama North One to…

547
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,823
-I'm gonna lower it.
-Lowering now.

548
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,693
Mr. Someda, can you hear us?
We're at the hospital.

549
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,462
You'll be fine. Entering now.

550
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,866
If only I had said it back then.

551
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,636
If your son ever decides
to inherit your business,

552
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,705
investing now will benefit him too.

553
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:53,077
I'll talk it over with my wife first.

554
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,581
If only I could have said it back then.

555
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,152
Listen, it's going to be
tough from now on,

556
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,857
but would you please stay with me?

557
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,061
If only I had said it…

558
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:18,168
-Look, Satoru.
-Wow, they're eating it. Look.

559
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,307
I'm the happiest man in the world.

560
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,576
What's gotten into you?

561
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,114
If only I could have let them know…

562
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,685
Maybe my life

563
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,821
would have turned out differently.

564
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,992
I'm sorry.

565
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,630
For being a pathetic
elder brother to the end.

566
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,134
Komugi.

567
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:52,937
I'm sorry.

568
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,807
For not telling you the truth.

569
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,813
I hope you can reach it.

570
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:09,253
Satoru…

571
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,392
I'm sorry.

572
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,662
I'm so sorry…

573
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:27,204
Time of death, 6:55 p.m.

574
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:51,595
Mr. Someda…

575
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,734
Where are you?

576
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,849
Someda has died.

577
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,551
Is that so?

578
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:20,724
It's a shame I won't be able
to eat that ramen anymore.

579
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,863
Was it…

580
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,667
Surely not, right?

581
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:31,902
Of course not.

582
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,824
That's our only lead.

583
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,126
-Before that lawyer tricks you.
-Have some trust.

584
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:00,364
-Connected by secrets.
-I'm always watching.

585
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,398
