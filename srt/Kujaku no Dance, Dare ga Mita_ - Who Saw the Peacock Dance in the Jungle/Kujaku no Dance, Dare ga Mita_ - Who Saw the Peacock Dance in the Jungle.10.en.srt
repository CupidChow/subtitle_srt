1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,609
Deeper

2
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,946
and deeper.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,418
That forest stretches on endlessly.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,923
But I still want to reach it.

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:32,132
The glimmer of light you stored there.

6
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,849
I will…

7
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,553
I will…

8
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,157
move forward.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,435
It will be okay.

10
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,236
Thank you for seeing us.

11
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,507
Have you been well?

12
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,617
Ms. Kyoko.

13
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,275
Why?

14
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,911
Mr. Kamii, call an ambulance.

15
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,419
I wanted to die

16
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:40,226
and end all of this forever!

17
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,428
-Wait--
-You coward!

18
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,899
That's too unfair!

19
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,636
It was you, wasn't it?

20
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,505
The one…

21
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,009
who gave birth to me.

22
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,017
You don't get to be so selfish.

23
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:21,901
Please tell me what happened.

24
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,338
All of it.

25
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,478
I have to know.

26
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,818
As your daughter.

27
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,203
He died…

28
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,343
surrounded by garbage.

29
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,996
It was starvation.

30
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,900
-Mikio? Wake up! Please!
-My brother was only five years old.

31
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,069
Mikio…

32
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:34,407
I think it all started that day.

33
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,613
Much later, I married Akazawa.

34
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,849
And we had Mamoru.

35
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,219
I swore to make him happy.

36
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,257
I would carve out a future
for both of us, no matter what.

37
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,627
I made a vow to myself.

38
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,232
As long as I had money,
that would never happen again.

39
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,168
And yet…

40
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,904
Leave Mamoru with someone and find work?

41
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,539
Yes.

42
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,308
I'm against it.

43
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,743
He's still just a baby.

44
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:20,353
You don't know me…

45
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:27,160
I started a company with Ikumi Hiroshima,
my childhood friend.

46
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,496
Behind Akazawa's back.

47
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,433
So your target demographic
is health-conscious housewives.

48
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,703
The one who lent me a helping hand was…

49
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,807
My condition is that you use
"Hayashikawa" in the product's name.

50
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,276
If you agree, I'm willing to invest.

51
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,981
I seized that opportunity.

52
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,852
Yay!

53
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:59,125
And then the two of us
became irreplaceable to each other.

54
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:05,064
I was living separately from Akazawa,
and I intended to divorce him,

55
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,202
so I could move on
to a new life with Mamoru.

56
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:18,745
That was when I learned that
I was pregnant with Yasunari's child.

57
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,116
And that was…

58
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,292
I did not hesitate.

59
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,463
I chose to give birth.

60
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,434
I'll leave my wife.

61
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,469
Really?

62
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,207
However, once the child is born,

63
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,744
she has to become a member
of the Hayashikawa family first.

64
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:53,746
What?

65
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,783
Our family has an image to maintain.

66
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,720
We have to make people think
that my wife is the mother.

67
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,057
I promise you,
I'll convince my wife and my parents.

68
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,662
I'll welcome you to the family soon after.

69
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,934
With that, I thought that I,
Mamoru, and this child

70
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,803
would never suffer such a cruel end.

71
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,737
Okay, we're done.

72
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,772
-I truly believed so.
-Mom?

73
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,410
Sometime after that,

74
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,914
I was told that the divorce
had been finalized.

75
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,351
Is it really okay?

76
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,320
Yes.

77
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,393
I'm back.

78
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:46,432
However, on that day, 22 years ago…

79
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,249
It's both your fault.

80
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,319
You tried…

81
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,792
to steal from me.

82
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,761
My children.

83
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,132
Souta and Oto.

84
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,601
Wait, Satoko--

85
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,337
All of it!

86
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,205
It's all your fault!

87
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,975
Satoko, where are Souta and Oto?

88
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,514
I let them depart first.

89
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,686
Souta! Oto!

90
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,826
No! Why?

91
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,362
We'll join them soon enough.

92
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,230
You go first.

93
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,636
Satoko… Stop, Satoko!

94
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,760
Why?

95
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,936
-Stop! What are you doing?
-It's all my fault!

96
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,138
Souta and Oto didn't deserve this!

97
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,341
Stop! You can't!

98
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,277
You can't!

99
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:43,082
If the world knew about this,
the Hayashikawa name would be ruined.

100
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,454
I have to at least protect
my family's reputation.

101
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:52,992
Help me!

102
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,762
I'll make it look like we were all killed.

103
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,200
What are you saying?

104
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,537
In the end, I will die too.

105
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,406
Stop!

106
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:11,043
Don't! What about Uta?

107
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,980
What will happen to her?

108
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,583
-She's your child!
-Please! Help me, Kyoko!

109
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,619
You're the only one I can ask!

110
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,758
You're the only one.
For the sake of the Hayashikawa name.

111
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,733
So, Rikiro was innocent?

112
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,882
Kyoko.

113
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,418
Thank you.

114
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,738
Everyone gets in my way.

115
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,246
I had nowhere I could return to
with this child in hand.

116
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,621
But then, Akazawa told me

117
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,593
that he would get
the Yamashitas to take you in.

118
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,765
I wanted to forget.

119
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,037
But you were so close.

120
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:57,349
And yet,
I still chose to leave it all behind.

121
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,319
And I've lived that way since.

122
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,892
But both Tomoya Endo and Mr. Yamashita…

123
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,963
began to look into the incident.

124
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,801
If it became clear
that Rikiro Endo was innocent,

125
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,105
it would spell disaster for your family.

126
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:24,176
It would affect both Mr. Akazawa,
and your son's future as a police officer.

127
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,581
That's why you had to keep it buried.

128
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,317
At any cost.

129
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,922
But to do that, you needed a collaborator.

130
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,657
And that was…

131
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,729
So you decided
to assist her in order to protect

132
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,431
your daughter's career.

133
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,638
Man, how do I put this?

134
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,209
That's so shallow.

135
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,780
And in the end, your daughter is now…

136
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,282
Right?

137
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,398
I wanted…

138
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:23,969
to protect--

139
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,538
That's enough!

140
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,506
No more.

141
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,081
I've heard enough.

142
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,788
My father's…

143
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,295
What were…

144
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,602
his last moments?

145
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,241
Tell me.

146
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,886
Your time's almost up.

147
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,424
Time's up.

148
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,129
Ms. Kyoko!

149
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,070
Let's go.

150
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,609
Tell me, Ms. Kyoko!

151
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,661
Thanks.

152
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,266
We'll find out about your father
once this goes to trial.

153
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,705
Do you remember?

154
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,740
What?

155
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,878
What you said to me here in the past.

156
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:20,252
I'll help you find out
whether the peacock danced or not.

157
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,888
I'll accompany you to the jungle.

158
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,259
I will be your eyes.

159
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:32,564
You said you'd be my eyes.

160
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,270
I guess I did.

161
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,339
You know what?

162
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,710
-You tried so hard to look cool.
-Stop!

163
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,815
-Thank you.
-Stop-- What?

164
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,489
For keeping your promise.

165
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,859
Well, I had no choice.

166
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,896
-You're just too persistent.
-What?

167
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,632
You keep getting up
every time you take a fall.

168
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,500
Komugi Yamashita is…

169
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,072
extremely persistent.

170
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,543
But that's a sign of strength.

171
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,945
I was just an escort.

172
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:24,483
All I did was follow you around
like a party member in Dragon Quest.

173
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,856
It was you who made it here.

174
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,595
I get it.

175
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,534
Maybe act a bit more humble.

176
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,474
That said, we're still only
at the entrance to the jungle.

177
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,480
The defendant, Toru Narukawa,

178
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,050
in collaboration with the defendant,
Kyoko Akazawa,

179
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,385
ordered a group
of unidentified individuals

180
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,120
to murder Susumu Someda

181
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:39,291
on January 14th, 2025,
near a river in Higashikayama.

182
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,962
Five days later, he made contact with
Kyoichiro Awayama and Manoka Takahata,

183
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,999
and set their house on fire.

184
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,937
Next, we'll hear
from the defendant, Kyoko Akazawa.

185
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,205
Please take the stand.

186
00:17:55,841 --> 00:18:01,146
That place was where it all went wrong.

187
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,388
I tried to end my life there.

188
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,126
-Kyoko! Don't!
-Stay away!

189
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,628
Stop! Let me--

190
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,314
Please.

191
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,583
Don't go.

192
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,754
Don't do this to Mamoru.

193
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,041
That day…

194
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,081
-Your phone is ringing.
-Okay.

195
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,562
Hello?

196
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,697
This is Yamashita.

197
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:32,070
I apologize for asking,
but could you meet me on Christmas Eve?

198
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,841
I need to talk to you.

199
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,413
I'm sorry, but talk about what exactly?

200
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,316
About the Higashikayama incident.

201
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:54,393
I prepared myself for the worst.

202
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,665
When I got to Haruo Yamashita's house…

203
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,970
I believe Rikiro Endo
was wrongfully convicted.

204
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,639
What?

205
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,375
Why would you tell me that?

206
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:18,951
I'm aware that you were in a relationship
with Yasunari Hayashikawa.

207
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:28,427
Just like you've always kept that secret,
I've kept a secret of my own.

208
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,833
On the day of the incident,

209
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:41,139
I happened to be in the area,
questioning people for a different case.

210
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,409
To all units in the Higashikayama area.

211
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,746
We've received word of dead bodies
in the Hayashikawa residence.

212
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,881
Please head to the location ASAP.

213
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,183
Hayashikawa…

214
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,531
Mr. Hayashikawa?

215
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,001
This is the police.

216
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,457
It was a ghastly sight.

217
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,046
There, there.

218
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,191
What happened?

219
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,661
Don't look, okay?

220
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,796
There, there. Everything's okay.

221
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,338
There you go.

222
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,146
It's all okay now.

223
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,224
Mr. Hayashikawa! This is the police.

224
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,059
Mr. Hayashikawa!

225
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,105
Mr. Yamashita.

226
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,049
-Check the second floor.
-Yes, sir.

227
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,358
Mr. Yamashita, Mr. Akazawa,
I found a survivor.

228
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,894
It's a child. Or rather, a baby.

229
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,499
I chose to stay quiet.

230
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,935
The baby was on the first floor.

231
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,804
-Are you certain about that?
-Yes.

232
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,704
That's false.

233
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,640
The baby was on the second floor.

234
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,010
I saw it myself.

235
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,416
At the time,
neither the police nor the media

236
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:16,455
had any doubt that Rikiro Endo
was the culprit behind that incident.

237
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,593
And then, he received a death sentence.

238
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:28,500
Mr. Yamashita felt that

239
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,339
his actions had distorted
Rikiro's testimony.

240
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,975
He regretted it.

241
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:46,284
When he had finished his explanation,

242
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,356
he asked me a question.

243
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,358
"Would you…

244
00:24:56,061 --> 00:25:02,467
please tell me what you know?

245
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,306
I want to hear the truth…

246
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:15,313
directly from you."

247
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:28,026
It's time to stop lying to Komugi.

248
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,165
That's why I want to hear it from you.

249
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,772
Both you and I…

250
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,010
are her parents.

251
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,488
Please, I'm begging you.

252
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,292
Please, don't tell anyone about this.

253
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,393
I can't do that.

254
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,963
Why? This will ruin everything!

255
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,633
It will ruin all our lives!
You, Komugi, and even Mamoru!

256
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,703
It was Rikiro who had his life ruined!

257
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,879
I want to use the rest of my life

258
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,049
to fix my mistakes.

259
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:35,493
And I want to be a father
Komugi can be proud of.

260
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:48,473
So you will get in my way too.

261
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:50,809
What?

262
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,800
I can't turn back.

263
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,437
Komugi

264
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,611
will definitely find her way…

265
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,050
to you.

266
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,820
To the peacock.

267
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,034
KOMUGI YAMASHITA
MY TRAIN ARRIVES AT 21:35 P.M.

268
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,677
After I put him to sleep with drugs,

269
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,313
I set the house on fire.

270
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,284
And finally,

271
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,489
I made sure the suspicion
would fall on Tomoya Endo,

272
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,361
who I had called out to a place nearby.

273
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,097
That is…

274
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,301
the whole truth.

275
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,175
I'm so sorry.

276
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,944
-Defendant, return to the seat.
-I'm sorry!

277
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,480
I'm so sorry!

278
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,649
I'm sorry!

279
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,050
I'm sorry…

280
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,585
We will take a short break.

281
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:44,456
I'm so sorry!

282
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,257
I'm sorry.

283
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,126
I'm so sorry.

284
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,499
You know, if it's okay with you,

285
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,236
we'd love for you
to stay on as a paralegal.

286
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,573
I'm happy you feel that way.

287
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,576
But I have to go to university.

288
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,780
That's cool, but also not cool.

289
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,615
Oh right, this is for you.

290
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,151
From Mr. Akazawa.

291
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,623
What is it?

292
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,759
No idea.

293
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,631
It's going to be so lonely without you.

294
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,933
-Right, Teru?
-I guess.

295
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,603
What's with the half-hearted response?

296
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,238
That's not cool at all.

297
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,074
Well, you know.

298
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,080
Stay well, okay?

299
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,587
Thank you, Mr. Matsukaze.

300
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,057
For everything you've done.

301
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,605
To think a police detective
knew so little about his own family.

302
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,409
Isn't it pathetic?

303
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,916
-Yes.
-Idiot!

304
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,351
Oh, sorry.

305
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,961
Don't make me laugh.
What if my wound reopens?

306
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,634
I'm a failure.

307
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,138
In every way.

308
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,784
Why are you here?

309
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,590
You shouldn't come here.

310
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,359
I'm leaving.

311
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,164
Don't run!

312
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,869
I told you.

313
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,907
I will see your path through to the end.

314
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:22,714
That's why I want you
to stay true to your role.

315
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,784
Your role…

316
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,588
as my father!

317
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,336
You okay with it ending like this?

318
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,242
I'm just finished with another job.

319
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,111
That's all it is.

320
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,915
Yes, I'm sure that's all.

321
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,926
Dad's phone?

322
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,708
Dear Komugi Yamashita,

323
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:03,047
the crimes Kyoko has committed
are too grave to ever be forgiven.

324
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,250
The two of us, as husband and wife,

325
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,021
will spend the rest of our lives
atoning for our sins.

326
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,893
Kyoko was secretly carrying
the phone enclosed herewith.

327
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,830
I am returning it to you.

328
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,102
"As husband and wife…"

329
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,421
ADACHI YOTSUBA KINDERGARTEN
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

330
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,174
So nostalgic.

331
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,287
DECEMBER 24, 2024

332
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,398
What?

333
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,740
He was here on that day?

334
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,682
Did you unlock the door?

335
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,186
We're home.

336
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,520
We're back.

337
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,267
You got old.

338
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,842
At least start with a "welcome back."

339
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:59,857
I know it's awfully late,
but I got this for you.

340
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,660
A Christmas present.

341
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:29,120
You've got to hold the ball like this
when throwing a curveball, got it?

342
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,292
Oh, wait.

343
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,894
Is it the wrong size?

344
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:45,770
No crying.

345
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,611
Good for you, Tomoya.

346
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,416
It's what you wanted.

347
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,685
Shut it.

348
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,557
Mr. Kamii.

349
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,928
You've done so much for me.

350
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,099
Thank you for all of it.

351
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,337
Hey, let's not do that.
This isn't my kind of thing.

352
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,744
Right.

353
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,548
Can you throw a proper curveball now?

354
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,416
Huh, Kamii?

355
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,457
Not at all.

356
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,661
-Come here, you goof.
-Hey, wait.

357
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,929
Stop, old man.

358
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,865
Get smaller, damn it.

359
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,102
-You're so strong.
-Of course I am.

360
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,143
To…

361
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,013
To Komugi,

362
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:09,287
If you happen to find this video,
stop watching it immediately.

363
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,955
-Well…
-Why?

364
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:17,895
This video
is for me to practice saying this

365
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,097
to you directly.

366
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,033
Okay.

367
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,570
Hey, Komugi.

368
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,745
This feels so embarrassing.

369
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:41,886
But since you want to hear it,
and I just promised you.

370
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,322
-What is this?
-About your Christmas present.

371
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,491
Those words of gratitude.

372
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:52,763
What do you want?
You know, as a Christmas present?

373
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,498
You're not supposed to ask.

374
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,068
I want those.

375
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,102
What?

376
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,637
Words of gratitude.

377
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:08,279
You know how I don't like bell peppers?

378
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:13,918
You always cut them into small pieces
and sneakily add them to the side dishes.

379
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,119
Thanks for that.

380
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,388
And also…

381
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,890
You knew about that?

382
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:26,497
I used to have trouble
applying lotion on my back.

383
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:33,137
Thanks for helping me with stretches
until I became able to do that on my own.

384
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:42,680
Also, I know you think
I was the one who taught you that trick.

385
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,014
The chopsticks.

386
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:50,121
Where you rub them first,
and then they break evenly.

387
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:55,826
Thank you for teaching me that trick.

388
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,728
What?

389
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,235
-What are you doing?
-Try rolling it.

390
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,936
And then?

391
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,372
-Next?
-Pull.

392
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,375
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, my.

393
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,144
Like this? Wow.

394
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,146
They broke evenly.

395
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,481
That's amazing, Komugi.

396
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,492
It was me?

397
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,864
That's right.

398
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,041
It was you, Komugi.

399
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,854
Thank you.

400
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:07,565
For letting me be your dad.

401
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,238
Komugi.

402
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,154
Thank you for being born.

403
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,075
A growling stomach
just proves you're alive.

404
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,377
What?

405
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,980
I've never heard a person's stomach
growl while they cry.

406
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,482
I'm not hungry, okay?

407
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:09,520
Well, what if I told you
I found some Michelin-tier ramen?

408
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,456
-I wouldn't say no to treating you--
-I'll go!

409
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,459
-That quick?
-I'll eat an unbelievable amount today.

410
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,496
Attorney Matsukaze.

411
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,304
Feel free.

412
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,273
Eat as much as you like.

413
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,277
Hey, wait…

414
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,846
Wait for me, would you?

415
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,909
