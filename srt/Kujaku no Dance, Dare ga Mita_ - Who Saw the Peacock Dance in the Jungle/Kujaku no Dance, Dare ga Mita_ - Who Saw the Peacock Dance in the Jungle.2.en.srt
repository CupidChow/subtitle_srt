1
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,088
I often have this dream.

2
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,795
I'm inside a dark forest.

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,197
I can't see a thing.

4
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,879
I walk through the dark forest.

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,484
I'll probably spend
my entire life in here.

6
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,288
I want to find some light.

7
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,391
But I am,

8
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,196
now and forevermore,

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,436
the child of a man…

10
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,939
awaiting execution.

11
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,548
YOSHITERU MATSUKAZE

12
00:01:55,615 --> 00:02:00,954
What do you mean by Komugi
not being Mr. Yamashita's daughter?

13
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,023
-You're kind of scary there.
-Please answer without joking around.

14
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,894
Well, my bad.

15
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,062
Have a seat.

16
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,698
I don't really have a serious reason.

17
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,007
I just felt like she didn't look
much like Haruo Yamashita.

18
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,675
Just a hunch, you see.

19
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,880
But guess what?

20
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,082
Whenever I have a hunch like this,

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,684
I'm usually right.

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,122
My bad if it came across the wrong way.

23
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,991
What are you scheming?

24
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,425
Scheming?

25
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,928
Come on now, that's a bit rude.

26
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,996
It's nothing big.

27
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:48,101
I just want to make
a little trade with her.

28
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,238
I just want her to state
her current feelings frankly,

29
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,474
and allow me to write about it.

30
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,878
And in exchange, I'll hand something over.

31
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,813
Hand what over?

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,552
Secrets about your father
that even you don't know.

33
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,188
What?

34
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:12,058
Just so you know,
I have quite a few of them.

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,794
How about it?

36
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,497
Let's go.

37
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,767
I'm talking to Komugi, aren't I?

38
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,003
Can you see me? Did I become a ghost?

39
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,538
Please rest assured.

40
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,273
You're quite alive.

41
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,174
Yasumura?

42
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,144
We'll contact you from our end
if we ever need to.

43
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,781
On that note, let's go, young lady.

44
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,601
Got a helicopter parent, I see.

45
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,346
Hey. You don't need to walk me home.

46
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,452
Hey. I'm sorry.

47
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,754
Just to be clear, I'm not angry.

48
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,556
Sorry, that's a lie.

49
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,157
I'm a little angry.

50
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,460
Why are you so reckless?

51
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,295
It's okay to be proactive,

52
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,597
but you're rushing
into situations too blindly.

53
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,068
The job of magazine writers is to write
articles that people want to read,

54
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,303
for better or worse.

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,539
So it's best
not to take them at face value.

56
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,409
Well, that said,

57
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:41,581
it's not my business
whether you take his deal or not.

58
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,922
I just want to learn more about my father.

59
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,626
Especially the parts he never told me.

60
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,833
I'll go home for today.

61
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,203
Thank you.

62
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,617
Are you usually free?

63
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,156
-What?
-Do you do any part-time jobs or the like?

64
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,426
I have university to deal with.

65
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,496
What do you think
about working part-time at my office?

66
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,832
What?

67
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,903
Our paralegals have been quitting
one after another, you see.

68
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:41,040
And you might be able to help
with learning more about your father.

69
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,544
Plus, it will cause me problems
if you keep acting on your own.

70
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,245
-I'm fine either way--
-I'll do it!

71
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,313
That was quick!

72
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,218
But, wait,
I have to go meet Mr. Akazawa tomorrow.

73
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,920
So the day after.

74
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,788
Mr. Akazawa?

75
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,124
He's a police officer
who worked with my dad.

76
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,361
I've known him since I was little.

77
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,600
Oh, and I'll tell you in advance
so you don't get angry later.

78
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:12,872
I'm thinking it might be okay
to show him the letter.

79
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,111
Maybe once he reads it,

80
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,115
it might get him
to reinvestigate some things.

81
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,852
Honestly, that letter alone
probably won't do much.

82
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,089
The police probably had good reason
to arrest Tomoya Endo in the first place.

83
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,361
But it might be a good idea
to get his opinion on the matter.

84
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,465
Okay.

85
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,272
I'm not hungry.

86
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,807
I didn't ask.

87
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,613
Bye then.

88
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,819
Hey. I'm thinking of going
for some ramen right about now.

89
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,655
-You want to come with?
-No, thanks.

90
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,390
Maybe another time then?

91
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:10,930
To be honest, I would actually be okay
with treating you to some ramen.

92
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,366
On a later date then.

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,535
Okay.

94
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,407
A growling stomach is proof you're alive!

95
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,109
It did not growl!

96
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,931
You can take a break, Rikiro.

97
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,034
Oh, thanks a lot. I'll take one later.

98
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,471
You've got a good father there.

99
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,371
Yes.

100
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,342
I'm home!

101
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,810
Welcome back.

102
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,012
-Hey! Don't run!
-Wash these, okay?

103
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,281
Now, hold on just a moment.

104
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,951
Tuck your shirt in. There you go.

105
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,919
-Welcome back.
-I'm home.

106
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,589
Are you tired?
Now, go and wash your hands.

107
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,601
-Can't sleep, can you?
-Yes.

108
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,143
Pretty, isn't it?

109
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,713
Yes, it's pretty.

110
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,653
That must have been
the happiest time of my life.

111
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,937
Goodbye.

112
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,079
She went and abandoned you.

113
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,619
And she calls herself a mother, huh?

114
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,231
Here.

115
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,802
BOTAN RICE CANDY

116
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,003
Let's go.

117
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,673
A family of six was found dead

118
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,742
in a residential area
in Higashikayama, Adachi City.

119
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,045
The deceased include Yasunari Hayashikawa,

120
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,382
his wife, Satoko, his eldest son, Souta,
his eldest daughter, Oto,

121
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,151
as well as his father and mother

122
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,654
Akihiro and Noriko,
who lived in the same house, respectively.

123
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,791
The police say their limbs
were tied up and they were hanged

124
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,893
from the railing of the house's stairway.

125
00:09:58,864 --> 00:09:59,765
Excuse me.

126
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,734
What is it?

127
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,605
Could you tell that lawyer
I want to talk to him?

128
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,476
Tell him it's important.

129
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,602
You wanted to talk to me?

130
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,304
What is it?

131
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,578
I'm the one…

132
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,586
who killed Haruo Yamashita.

133
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,242
-Ms. Kyoko.
-Komugi.

134
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,883
You've done so well.

135
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,127
Did anything else happen
with that reporter?

136
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,597
No, nothing in particular.

137
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,932
Good.

138
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:44,904
We're still looking into it, but we did
give a stern warning to his company.

139
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,672
Thank you.

140
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,144
Oh, right.

141
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,814
I brought this.

142
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,817
-Kyoko.
-I hope you like it.

143
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,321
Oh, you didn't have to.

144
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,957
Thank you. But you can come
empty-handed from now on.

145
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,726
Okay.

146
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,263
And also…

147
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:26,011
My father left me this letter.

148
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,313
Letter?

149
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,504
Do you think Tomoya Endo is innocent?

150
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,606
Yes.

151
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,675
It's what my father said.

152
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,378
I'll say it again.

153
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,549
Tomoya Endo is the one
who killed Mr. Yamashita.

154
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:10,089
Also, do you have proof
that Mr. Yamashita wrote this?

155
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,996
There's a chance that Tomoya
coerced Mr. Yamashita into writing this.

156
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,466
Wait. What do you mean?

157
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,903
My subordinate got eyewitness testimony
of a few days before the crime.

158
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,372
At a café in Shinjuku,

159
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,742
Tomoya Endo was seen
intimidating Mr. Yamashita.

160
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,379
Tomoya Endo and my father were together?

161
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,915
We're trying to verify it,

162
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,953
but if Tomoya coerced
Mr. Yamashita into writing this letter,

163
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,490
the other names
might be there as a distraction.

164
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,662
Tomoya rejected the offer to get
a consultation with a public defender.

165
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,133
Maybe the reason he rejected it
is because he knew

166
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,804
that this lawyer named Matsukaze
would eventually come and visit him.

167
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,142
Listen, Komugi.

168
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,445
What I despise most in this world

169
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,582
are criminals who try
to escape punishment by lying.

170
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,120
There are people in this world
who feel absolutely no guilt

171
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,424
about deceiving others.

172
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,598
Even still…

173
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,902
I believe…

174
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,107
in my father.

175
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,980
I know my father better than anyone.

176
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,214
That's why…

177
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,517
I know it.

178
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,589
My father wouldn't be so easily
intimidated into aiding a criminal.

179
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,393
He wasn't that weak.

180
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,433
Okay.

181
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,904
At any rate, I'll look into this letter.

182
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,472
I'll hold on to it for now.

183
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,009
I'm grateful for your help.

184
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,445
You killed Haruo Yamashita?

185
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,653
Would she still pay
the attorney fees if I said that?

186
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,491
Komugi Yamashita, I mean.

187
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,694
Why would that name come up?

188
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,001
I've written what I want you to do
in the notebook.

189
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,038
-Have a read.
-Please wait!

190
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,573
Will I know
everything I need to if I read it?

191
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,675
We're done.

192
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,419
I'm back.

193
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,421
Sorry for running late.

194
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,755
-Welcome back.
-Welcome home.

195
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,060
It's been a while, Mamoru.

196
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,561
Komugi.

197
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,764
My condolences for your loss.

198
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,600
Sorry to make you worry.

199
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,071
It's been quite a while, hasn't it?

200
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,275
-Oh, I'll help.
-Thanks.

201
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,844
Could you get the plates and chopsticks?

202
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:20,813
Got it.

203
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,686
Go and wash your hands, Mamoru.

204
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:32,691
Mom, I'm an adult.
I can do it without you having to tell me.

205
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:37,930
Okay, then could you please
put those socks away properly?

206
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,000
Come on, let it slide. We're family.

207
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,268
Oh, right.

208
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,071
I wanted to give you something, Komugi.

209
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,710
Here.

210
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,545
In here,

211
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,149
there's a whole lot
of nostalgia hidden away.

212
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,083
Look.

213
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,187
Is that from one
of our moon-viewing picnics?

214
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,357
You see, now that I look closer,

215
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,260
you've really started
to look like your mother.

216
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,839
Sorry for being late!

217
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,775
-Oh, he's here!
-Hello there.

218
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,444
-I'm really sorry. Here, some dango.
-Thank you!

219
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,446
-Thank you so much.
-Dango, huh?

220
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,615
Look, dango.

221
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,952
What do you want to eat, Komugi?

222
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,921
Like father, like daughter.

223
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:36,922
What?

224
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:37,990
What now?

225
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,228
What are you doing?

226
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:48,434
Did you know
that the light of the moon brings hope?

227
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:54,940
Babies are often born
on the night of a full moon.

228
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,077
And you know those shooting stars?

229
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,814
The ones that people wish to?

230
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,716
Shooting stars?

231
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,019
They have nothing to do
with the moon though.

232
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,656
Hope, huh?

233
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,329
For whatever reason,
it does cheer me up a little too.

234
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,124
It's true, right?

235
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:25,631
I'm his daughter, aren't I?

236
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,647
MEET WITH MY FATHER

237
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,248
With Rikiro?

238
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,599
Man, I'm so lost.

239
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,268
"Get in contact with Mr. Kamii
from Weekly Jidai.

240
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,770
Parentheses, he can be trusted."

241
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,072
To think he was connected to this.

242
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,208
"Ask him if I should take you
as my attorney.

243
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:13,111
To Mr. Kamii, if this person can be
trusted, hand him the documents."

244
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,584
Is this the same Kamii as the reporter
who trespassed into Komugi's house?

245
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,186
I wish they just had the same name.

246
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,723
By the way, when will Komugi start work?

247
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,229
Oh, right. It's today.

248
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,899
They're connected?

249
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,601
So it seems.

250
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,738
In addition, Tomoya Endo met
with Komugi's father.

251
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,808
So there's a chance
he made him write the letter.

252
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,210
And he knew why I visited him.

253
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,279
Something is off about all this.

254
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,549
Excuse me.

255
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,685
-There's something I'm confused about.
-Yes?

256
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:59,958
Why is Tomoya Endo
staying silent in the first place?

257
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,162
If he didn't do it,
why doesn't he just say so?

258
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,964
Try to think about it.

259
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:07,733
"I didn't do it."

260
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,767
And the police go?

261
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,069
-"Wait, you didn't do it?"
-"No, I didn't."

262
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,638
-"You really didn't?"
-"I didn't."

263
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,406
"Be honest! You did it, didn't you?"

264
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,875
"I'm telling you, I didn't do it!
Believe me!"

265
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,711
"Okay.

266
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,381
Well then, you're free to go."

267
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,317
Do you think that would happen?
The police aren't that soft.

268
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,958
The right to remain silent is the single
strongest weapon a suspect has.

269
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,926
An orichalcum sword, so to speak.

270
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,631
Well, staying silent is certainly
the best thing you can do.

271
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,435
It's an effective strategy
before you get a lawyer involved.

272
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:48,440
However, it's definitely true
that Tomoya Endo holds an important clue.

273
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:53,345
Ideally, I would want to be appointed as
his defense counsel as soon as possible.

274
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,348
But you have to contact Mr. Kamii first.

275
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:01,053
I'm not exactly thrilled about having
to contact that man with the curly bangs.

276
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,754
Is it bad to contact him?

277
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,989
What do you think?

278
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,391
I'm the one who asked you…

279
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:11,830
If we contact him, he'll definitely try
to get an interview out of it.

280
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,666
That's fine with me.

281
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,271
You'll be beside me, right?

282
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,777
You'll take me to the jungle
where the peacock is, right?

283
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,314
Then I'm fine.

284
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,687
I trust you.

285
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,859
I see what's up.

286
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,098
Based on these facts,

287
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,234
it is believed that Mr. Yamashita
was knocked out by some means,

288
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,870
and the culprit started
the fire afterward.

289
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,373
-It has to be Tomoya Endo.
-It's clear as day.

290
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,376
The only complication is,
Mr. Yamashita left behind a letter.

291
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,510
-Letter?
-What letter?

292
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:03,615
In it, he states that Tomoya Endo
is not the culprit.

293
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,518
-What is that about?
-What's that supposed to mean?

294
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,187
Could that letter have been forged?

295
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,323
-Right. What about it?
-Well?

296
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,458
How the hell would we know just yet?

297
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,661
What I can say for sure is,

298
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,099
Mr. Yamashita may have been retired,
but he was one of us.

299
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,635
For the honor of the police,

300
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,772
we'll make sure
Tomoya Endo gets prosecuted!

301
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,741
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

302
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,681
Yes? Jidai's editing department, speaking.

303
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,353
Attorney Matsukaze, is it?

304
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,454
Hello.

305
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,257
I have some questions for you.

306
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,792
Could we speak at a later time?

307
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:51,730
Well, in that case, could you email me
the main points in advance?

308
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,231
No, I'll ask you directly.

309
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,902
Not very accommodating, are you?

310
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,737
Will it be just you?

311
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:11,049
You know what, I'll come over.
Does around nine o'clock sound good?

312
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,217
Understood.

313
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,186
Komugi will be sitting in as well.

314
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,987
Wait. Really?

315
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,623
Got it. See you later then.

316
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,930
Editor-in-chief, sir.

317
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,899
I've got a scoop for the next issue.

318
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,935
Are you sure, Kamii?

319
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,771
You better not disappoint me later.

320
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,940
Who do you think I am?

321
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,976
I'm Kamii.

322
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,548
Also, don't you guys ever want to know?

323
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,984
The truth.

324
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,389
All I want is to find that out.

325
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,059
Every detail of it.

326
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,631
Even if it takes me to hell.

327
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,470
He'll be here at 9:00 p.m.

328
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,207
We still have some time then.

329
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,415
I'm not hungry.

330
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,354
Let's not fight on an empty stomach.

331
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,923
Want to go and get that ramen
we talked about before?

332
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,424
You too, Mr. Hasami.

333
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,927
Sorry, I'm on a gluten-free diet.

334
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,595
I'll pass this time.

335
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,364
Maybe somewhere else next time.

336
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,466
Count me out as well.

337
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,302
I'll pay for it.

338
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,210
Lights out!

339
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,551
The only one who knows it all…

340
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,988
is the peacock.

341
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,401
Man, it's so damn hot.

342
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,171
What? You're still up?

343
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,040
Go to sleep.

344
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,809
-Dad?
-Yes?

345
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,512
Did you see the Higashikayama news?

346
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,783
See it? I'm the one who called the police.

347
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,888
I went to tend to the garden
at Mr. Hayashikawa's place.

348
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,624
Well, let's just say
it was a terrible sight.

349
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,463
Then the police asked me
a whole bunch of questions.

350
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,498
Okay.

351
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,074
Keep it down!

352
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,076
You're being a nuisance!

353
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,311
-Could I get a comment?
-Can I have a few words?

354
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,347
Just for a little bit!

355
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,681
Go away!

356
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,552
Could you describe the scene
that you witnessed?

357
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,488
Hey, you're pretty. You can come in.

358
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,726
-Here, have a drink.
-Thank you so much!

359
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,230
The news reported that you were
the first person on the scene.

360
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,799
I sure was!

361
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,935
I went to do some gardening

362
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,505
at Mr. Hayashikawa's place
and saw that terrible sight.

363
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,108
I called the cops at once.

364
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,709
I see.

365
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,513
How dare she write all that nonsense!

366
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,982
Fuck! Damn it!

367
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,120
SHOCKING NEWS ABOUT HIGASHIKAYAMA CASE!
FIRST PERSON ON THE SCENE COMMITTED THEFT?

368
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:41,292
Dad? You're not involved
with the Higashikayama case, right?

369
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,563
Of course not.

370
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,034
Don't ask stuff like that.

371
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,070
Yes? Hello.

372
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:55,640
I'm from the Higashikayama police station.
You're Mr. Rikiro Endo, yes?

373
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:01,146
We have a warrant for your arrest
under charges of robbery and murder.

374
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,683
-Wait inside.
-You're under arrest.

375
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,084
-I'll take the child.
-Dad!

376
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,219
-It's okay. Let's go inside.
-Dad!

377
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,021
-Let's wait inside.
-Dad!

378
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,723
It's okay. Everything's fine.

379
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,725
-Look, there he is.
-Mr. Endo!

380
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,261
Mr. Endo, could you give a comment?

381
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,197
Mr. Endo, do you have anything to say?

382
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,767
DIE / TRASH

383
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,571
MURDERERS SHOULD BE EXECUTED
DIE, GET OUT

384
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,823
It's fine. Let's go.

385
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,357
They've come out!

386
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,461
-We can see Rikiro Endo.
-The suspect is Rikiro Endo--

387
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,528
Over here.

388
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,997
Tomoya!

389
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,933
Stop, Tomoya!

390
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,134
Stop!

391
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,402
Mr. Endo!

392
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,675
Dad!

393
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,555
Now listen, Tomoya.

394
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:22,427
There is absolutely no reason
to try to cover for your father.

395
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,897
I feel sorry for you.

396
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,234
Being born to a father like that.

397
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,636
It's just sad.

398
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:40,345
Soon after, my father confessed
that he was guilty of the charges.

399
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,759
Your dad couldn't have killed
six people on his own!

400
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,229
You helped him too, didn't you?

401
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,565
Die!

402
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,400
Kill the murderer!

403
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,182
You're Tomoya, right?

404
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,090
It's from your mom.

405
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,293
TO TOMOYA

406
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,405
I'VE BEEN WORRIED SICK SINCE I SAW
THE NEWS. ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT?

407
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,548
I CAN'T COME AND MEET YOU RIGHT NOW
BUT I PROMISE I'LL COME AS SOON AS I CAN.

408
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,887
Sorry about that.

409
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,023
Your mom said she wanted a picture of you.

410
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,064
"LIVING WITH HIM WAS HELL"

411
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,600
It's a lie. I never said any of this!

412
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,501
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH DEFENDANT'S SON

413
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:15,273
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

414
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:20,111
TO TOMOYA

415
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,111
Breaking news!

416
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,814
The defendant, Rikiro Endo,
has just received the death penalty.

417
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,183
In 2002, the defendant, Rikiro Endo…

418
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,888
And thus, I became
the son of a death row inmate.

419
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,332
We got an anonymous tip

420
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,635
that you're the son of the guy
behind the Higashikayama murders.

421
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,673
I'm sorry to do this,
but you get it, don't you?

422
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,276
Hey. Put those inside.

423
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,611
Okay, will do.

424
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,813
It wasn't me.

425
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,716
I'm not the one…

426
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,553
who did it.

427
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,723
It doesn't make a difference.

428
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,293
Stack them, okay?

429
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,100
All I want

430
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:58,176
is some light in my life.

431
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,947
You're the lawyer from that letter?

432
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:09,387
This is the person my dad
left the money and letter with.

433
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,757
-Is that so?
-Here you go.

434
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,560
RAMEN

435
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,197
Thank you.

436
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,567
What are you doing?

437
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:31,009
Well, when you do this,
they break cleanly in half.

438
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,648
Wait, you're right.

439
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,453
My dad taught me that trick.

440
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,224
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thanks for the meal.

441
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,229
Yummy.

442
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,196
Good to hear.

443
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,199
I know, right?

444
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,073
It must be the stock.

445
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,676
Yes, it's the stock.

446
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,218
-It has to be the stock--
-Will you stop already?

447
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,726
I'm home.

448
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,861
It was cold out, wasn't it?

449
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:34,205
So you admit to setting fire
to your boss' house?

450
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,873
Yes.

451
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,378
Three days before that,
a warehouse nearby was burned down.

452
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,446
Was that you too?

453
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,449
Warehouse?

454
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,119
That's news to me.

455
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,287
We have witnesses

456
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:53,291
who say they saw you wandering
in the area at the time of the crime.

457
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,228
You also caused a fire
as a kid, didn't you?

458
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,366
Well, yes, but the warehouse wasn't me.

459
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,735
You did it, didn't you?!

460
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,208
You did it.

461
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:11,776
Hey.

462
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,747
You sure you want to deny it?
You could get rearrested.

463
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,618
If you don't admit it,
you might even get a life sentence.

464
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,622
You just have to sign a statement
and we'll make sure you get off easy.

465
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,623
Okay?

466
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,929
I realized something at that moment.

467
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,765
About my father.

468
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,305
My father must have…

469
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,514
How was it?

470
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,983
It could get a Michelin star,
to put it lightly.

471
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,684
Thanks for the treat.

472
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,188
I'm glad you liked it.

473
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:16,507
My father must have been…

474
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,779
innocent.

475
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,015
So?

476
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,118
So you admit it?

477
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,220
He was just…

478
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,057
tired.

479
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:38,996
Dad…

480
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,603
It must have been so frustrating.

481
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,532
There's no going back now.

482
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:19,971
Right?

483
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:57,475
There's no light out there
that would shine…

484
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,145
on me.

485
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,195
-Thank you for coming.
-Hey.

486
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,036
This way.

487
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,173
Over there.

488
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,655
Here you go.

489
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,691
Oh, my.

490
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,194
You started working here, Komugi?

491
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,698
-Yes.
-Since when? And why?

492
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,901
-How's the pay? Are you getting paid?
-Well--

493
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,669
I can answer those questions.

494
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,378
Wait. What about Komugi?

495
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,647
Attorney?

496
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,717
Sorry, what?

497
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,085
What's going on?

498
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,153
Hey, Attorney--

499
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,655
That's battery right there.

500
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,225
It carries a sentence of up to two years,
a penalty of up to 300,000 yen,

501
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,626
a detention, or a fine.

502
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,429
That's nasty!

503
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,432
-That's a nasty trap.
-I'll sue you. Just wait.

504
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,835
But before we talk about that…

505
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:34,138
SUSPECT'S NOTEBOOK
DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION

506
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,172
What's this?

507
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:58,062
"To Mr. Kamii,
if this person can be trusted,

508
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,332
hand him the documents."

509
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,075
Can I ask what kind of situation
I'm in right now?

510
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,345
And while I'm asking questions,

511
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:19,283
how do you and Komugi know each other?

512
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,287
It doesn't seem like
you're offering legal advice.

513
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,391
Wait. I get it.

514
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,530
Someone must have hired you.

515
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,136
Well, who was it?

516
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,706
I'm obliged to keep it confidential.

517
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,212
It must be nice to be able to use
confidentiality as a defense.

518
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,613
It's so convenient.

519
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,919
But I bet it has something to do
with Komugi, doesn't it?

520
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,287
I can't say.

521
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,055
Well, in that case,

522
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,926
I take it you don't want
this present from me.

523
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,997
Also, is this allowed?

524
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,967
Is it okay for you to hire
the victim's daughter

525
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,405
in a case for which you're trying
to defend the suspect in court?

526
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,541
I have to say though,

527
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,245
I haven't been this excited
in a long time.

528
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,248
You two are such a mystery!

529
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,618
Komugi.

530
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,956
What are you hiding?

531
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,191
Won't you please tell me?

532
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,597
Well, no matter
how hard you try to hide it,

533
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:44,235
even if it's hidden
deep inside a dark forest,

534
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,604
I assure you that I'll uncover it.

535
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,575
Sorry. Did I lose you with the metaphor?

536
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,379
The only person here who's hiding
something would be you, Mr. Kamii.

537
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,550
Well, it's true that I met Tomoya

538
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,453
a few times in regard
to the Higashikayama incident.

539
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,891
Here, a present for you.

540
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,732
If you accept this present from me,
I'll hand them over as a reward.

541
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,801
The documents.

542
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,838
I would love to see your reaction.

543
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,141
Please, do accept it.

544
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,810
-Come on.
-Stop.

545
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,047
It's something important about you.
You make the decision!

546
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,149
-Cut it out!
-Mr. Matsukaze.

547
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,789
Let me read it now.

548
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,626
You don't have to worry about me.

549
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,130
So she says.

550
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,869
Isn't this some sort of crime too?

551
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,376
AUNT/NIECE DNA TEST REPORT

552
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,817
STATEMENT OF RESULTS

553
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:10,254
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY UNLIKELY
THAT THE ALLEGED AUNT "NATSUMI KIMURA"

554
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:14,325
IS THE BIOLOGICAL AUNT
OF THE ALLEGED NIECE "KOMUGI YAMASHITA"

555
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,830
My aunt and I…

556
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,101
are not related…

557
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,140
by blood?

558
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,780
Ms. Natsumi Kimura
graciously agreed to cooperate.

559
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,550
And going by that result,

560
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:45,756
I was right that you're not
your father's real daughter.

561
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,394
No…

562
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:57,434
It can't be.

563
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,602
Komugi.

564
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,404
And you know what my mind went to?

565
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,407
The only survivor
of the Higashikayama incident,

566
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,210
less than a year old at the time,

567
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,779
Uta Hayashikawa.

568
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:14,118
Do you think it's just a coincidence

569
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:20,491
that you are the same age as her?

570
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,701
The forest that I've stepped foot into

571
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,973
runs ever so deep.

572
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,676
It stretches out before me

573
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,680
with no end in sight.

574
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,255
I trust my father.

575
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,824
The letter he left behind
might not be real.

576
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:57,227
-The one who forged the letter is…
-Let's hear the details.

577
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,230
What do you even know about your father?

578
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,298
