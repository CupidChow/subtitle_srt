1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,072
On the night of Christmas Eve,

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:10,410
my father was murdered by someone.

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,846
The person arrested as the primary suspect

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,247
was Tomoya Endo.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,184
Tomoya was the son of Rikiro Endo,
a man who received the death penalty

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:23,723
for murdering a family
22 years ago in Higashikayama.

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,458
However…

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,627
Mr. Yamashita left an envelope with me.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,328
TO KOMUGI

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:32,032
The letter my father left to me
spoke of false accusations.

11
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,869
I'm proud to call you my daughter.

12
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,639
This letter was written by my father.

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,275
I trusted my father's letter

14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:46,479
and sought to uncover the truth
alongside a lawyer named Matsukaze.

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,881
But then…

16
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:53,987
My aunt and I are not related by blood?

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,158
You're not your father's real daughter.

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:03,129
Is the father I put my trust in
not my actual father?

19
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,331
If so, then…

20
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,167
who even am I?

21
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,735
It can't be.

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,404
And you know what my mind went to?

23
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,841
The only survivor
of the Higashikayama incident,

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,843
less than a year old at the time,

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,511
Uta Hayashikawa.

26
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,383
Do you think it's just a coincidence

27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,686
that you are the same age as her?

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,690
Please don't move things along
based purely on speculation.

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,460
-Sorry?
-Is this DNA test report credible?

30
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,062
-Credible?
-What about Komugi's DNA?

31
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,031
How did you get it?

32
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,733
Your father--

33
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,639
GREEN TEA

34
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,809
"I'm obliged to keep it confidential."

35
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,446
Here.

36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,318
Okay then, I'll send you
the documents tomorrow.

37
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,332
RELATIONSHIP CHART

38
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,835
Why did Mr. Yamashita
leave that letter with Someda?

39
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,305
Yes, why would he give it
to a ramen stall owner?

40
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,408
Akisada, go and tail Someda.

41
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,810
What?

42
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,614
I'm still not sold on this letter
being from Mr. Yamashita.

43
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,049
Understood.

44
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,619
Also,

45
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,321
check if Someda is clean.

46
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,191
Clean? You want to check
for a criminal record?

47
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,075
Go home for today.

48
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,512
-No, I'm sorry--
-Make me a promise.

49
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,649
Just get some rest.
Don't go and meet someone.

50
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,751
We'll decide what to do tomorrow.

51
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,085
Can you promise that?

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,221
I'll try my best.

53
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,489
Try your best?

54
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,325
You're definitely going
to go somewhere, aren't you?

55
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,327
Now listen up.

56
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,298
Head straight home.

57
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,766
Got it?

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,002
Your answer? Yes?

59
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,504
Yes.

60
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,643
I'm worried about Komugi.

61
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,879
Well, yes.

62
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,248
Also, are those glasses new?

63
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,387
-Where did you get them?
-From an old guy in Asakusa.

64
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,623
Oh, an old guy, huh?

65
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,596
But still, man,
that Kamii guy had a DNA test done?

66
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,397
That's so not cool.

67
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,866
I'll hand them over as a reward.

68
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,867
The documents.

69
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,935
HAND HIM THE DOCUMENTS

70
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,473
And? Will you get
the documents in question?

71
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,878
He said he would send them today,
but who knows how far we can trust him?

72
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,815
I wonder what these documents are.

73
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,886
So where's that old guy's shop?

74
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,222
Hey, where?

75
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,524
Near the station?

76
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,267
I am…

77
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,371
me, right?

78
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,709
Dad…

79
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,681
Komugi.

80
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,430
Dad?

81
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,116
Maybe what I thought was a peacock

82
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,886
wasn't actually one at all.

83
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,940
Komugi?

84
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,242
Komugi.

85
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,213
What's wrong?

86
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,183
Ms. Kyoko.

87
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,056
Thank you for waiting.

88
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,494
That's cute.

89
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,629
Please enjoy.

90
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,664
I know, right?

91
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,067
I saw this place on TV a while back,

92
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,302
and I really wanted
to visit at least once.

93
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,406
But I felt reluctant to come here
all alone as an old lady.

94
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,779
It's so cute.

95
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,418
It's tough to decide
where to start eating these, right?

96
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,757
What?

97
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,597
It's so good!

98
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,867
You don't want to eat?

99
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,073
Ms. Kyoko.

100
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,776
What's wrong?

101
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,314
You've really started
to look like your mother.

102
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,987
Do I really resemble…

103
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,058
my father and mother?

104
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,161
What?

105
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,698
When we were looking
at those pictures before,

106
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,135
you said I was starting
to look like my mother.

107
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,072
Yes.

108
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,741
You look just like Shizuka when you laugh.

109
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,882
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,052
It's just, this part of you
is also just like her.

111
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,626
She was a big worrywart too.

112
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,629
Your face right now is identical to hers.

113
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,632
Also,

114
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,938
you take after your father
with your conviction and levelheadedness.

115
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,281
Thank you.

116
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,552
Now, you eat some too.

117
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,920
It's really good.

118
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:41,921
Okay.

119
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,279
Okay, I have it. Thanks.

120
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,980
WEEKLY JIDAI

121
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,782
Yes? Kamii speaking.

122
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,620
Right now?

123
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,759
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

124
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,501

EMAIL - TAKASHI KAMII

126
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,611
GLAD YOU ENJOYED MY PRESENT
HERE'S THE DOCUMENT

127
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,679
It's here.

128
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,848
-From Kamii?
-Yes.

129
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,519
INTERVIEW

130
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,933
KIMURA

131
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,572
Let me know if you need
another item from our catalog.

132
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,609
Right, maybe I'll get
a newer toilet as well.

133
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,243
I'll have it prepared.

134
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,583
Oh, Komugi.

135
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,558
It must have been cold outside.

136
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,629
You're renovating?

137
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,297
I certainly am!

138
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,000
Say, what color do you think
I should go with?

139
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,841
Aunt Natsumi,
you must already have an idea

140
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,845
of why I came here, don't you?

141
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,281
What's with the scary face?

142
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,251
Well, let's see.

143
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,856
The thing that comes to mind
is the DNA test I cooperated with.

144
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,326
I heard from the reporter.

145
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,464
So you really aren't Haruo's child.

146
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,770
Do you really think that's true?

147
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,471
Yes.

148
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,142
I am…

149
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,912
my father's daughter!

150
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,749
I can understand
why you'd want to say that.

151
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,618
But let me ask you.

152
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,555
Do you think you know
everything about Haruo?

153
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,294
Even if it's a parent,
a child, or a sibling,

154
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,031
it's impossible to know
everything about someone.

155
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,768
You understand that, right?
You're smart, after all.

156
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,974
Unfortunately, it just all made sense.

157
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,743
What?

158
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:57,917
Your mother had a uterine disease
that made childbirth a difficult prospect.

159
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,554
See? You didn't know that, did you?

160
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,857
Then suddenly, I heard
that she had gotten pregnant.

161
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,095
She didn't show herself
once during that period,

162
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,297
and then you were born.

163
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,034
I don't know where you came from,

164
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,438
but I imagine Shizuka
just couldn't give up.

165
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,940
Poor thing.

166
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,644
Since you don't have
any Yamashita blood in you,

167
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,214
I'll be looking after Haruo's money.

168
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,083
You get it, don't you?

169
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,085
You're smart, after all.

170
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,259
How delicious.

171
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,530
Drink your tea before it gets cold.

172
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,200
Good.

173
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,571
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,276
I deeply regret
what I've done to you, Tomoya.

175
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,246
What exactly are you apologizing for?

176
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,615
That voice…

177
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,952
I'm the one who killed Haruo Yamashita.

178
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,122
Tomoya Endo?

179
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,125
I'm asking you what the hell
you're apologizing for!

180
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,026
With who?

181
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,331
I've wronged both Rikiro
and Mr. Hayashikawa as well.

182
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,066
And what will you do about it?

183
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,872
Who is he talking to?

184
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,443
Haruo Yamashita?

185
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,647
HARUO YAMASHITA

186
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,589
Komugi.

187
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,925
What are you doing out here?

188
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,261
Came to meet your aunt, perhaps?

189
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,396
What did she say?

190
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,264
It has nothing to do with you.

191
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,670
What kind of person
was Haruo Yamashita in your eyes?

192
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,607
He must have been a good father to you.

193
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,711
Might not have been
as good of a person to others though.

194
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,713
What do you even know about my father?

195
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,118
Let me ask you.
What do youeven know about your father?

196
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,357
I…

197
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,161
trust my father.

198
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,032
When he's not even your real father?

199
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,605
Well?

200
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,484
Don't you want to know the truth?

201
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,159
Do a good job guiding me
to the forest, won't you?

202
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,262
My little Komugi.

203
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,633
REGRETS WHAT HE DID

204
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:05,437
I've wronged both Rikiro
and Mr. Hayashikawa as well.

205
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,072
And what will you do about it?

206
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:13,245
I'll borrow Mr. Kamii's help,
and I'll disclose everything.

207
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,581
Really?

208
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,123
Disclose everything? But what exactly?

209
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,058
I have no idea.

210
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,631
Also, was it Kamii that got
Tomoya Endo and Haruo to meet?

211
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,466
I have no idea about that either.

212
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,269
STATEMENT OF RESULTS
COMBINED RELATIONSHIP INDEX: LESS THAN 0.1

213
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,343
Teru?

214
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,179
I'm a bit hungry, so I'm going out to eat.

215
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,514
Where?

216
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,584
Here you go.

217
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,921
Thank you for the call.

218
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,524
A token of my appreciation.

219
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,796
-But you already gave me some last time.
-Please, feel free.

220
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,733
Although, if I ever need
something again in the future,

221
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,535
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

222
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,704
Of course.

223
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,405
I'm very grateful.

224
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,143
Excuse me.

225
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,145
Welcome, Attorney. Is it just you?

226
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,680
-Yes.
-Have a seat.

227
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,286
Can I have some shoyu ramen?

228
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,354
Sure thing.

229
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,491
RAMEN

230
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,294
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

231
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,451
It really is so good!

232
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,355
It was great. Thanks for the meal.

233
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,423
Glad to hear it.

234
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,260
Could I ask you a few questions?

235
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,562
About Komugi?

236
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,265
No. It's about the letter
from Mr. Yamashita, actually.

237
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,403
If there's anything you know.

238
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,341
I've already told the police
about it several times,

239
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,144
but after Komugi left early that night,

240
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:30,015
Mr. Yamashita started writing that letter.

241
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,053
It was Christmas Eve, so I thought
maybe it would go with a present.

242
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:40,259
Mr. Someda,
could you hold on to this for me?

243
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,693
Sure thing.

244
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,863
Could you hand it over to Komugi
next time she comes here?

245
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,632
Not a problem, sir.

246
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,968
What's the deal?
Too embarrassed to do it yourself?

247
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,006
Well, kind of, yes.

248
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:01,113
Recently, I can't help but think
that although I've made many sacrifices,

249
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,617
maybe I've just been
pretending to be a good father.

250
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,852
What's gotten into you?

251
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,289
You raised her
into such a fine young lady.

252
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,193
Your late wife would be
showering you with compliments.

253
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,097
Thanks.

254
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,667
That makes me feel a bit better.

255
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,608
I'd seen him in low spirits
a few times before,

256
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,644
so I thought maybe
he was just tired that time too.

257
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,814
Did you know that
Mr. Yamashita was involved

258
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,450
in the Higashikayama case investigation?

259
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,387
Well, yes, I did.

260
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,389
Not from him directly.

261
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,795
Was there anything different
about him before or after that incident?

262
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,532
Come to think of it,
it was sometime after that incident

263
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,069
that his wife got her diagnosis.

264
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
It was cancer, I think.

265
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,407
Komugi was still very young back then.

266
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:07,146
He said he didn't think
he could keep working as a detective,

267
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,680
so he moved to a police box.

268
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,015
Admirable, really.

269
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,717
He asked for it himself?

270
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,751
Pretty sure.

271
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,056
You knew him a long time, I take it?

272
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:18,957
Yes.

273
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,628
I knew him since before
I started a ramen stall,

274
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,096
so about 30 years, I think.

275
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,900
Can I ask how you two met?

276
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,137
Well, stuff happened, let's just say.

277
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,543
More importantly, Attorney,

278
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,479
if you're going to be around Komugi,
look after her, won't you?

279
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,948
I will.

280
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,151
Thank you for your time.

281
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,820
-Attorney, wait a minute!
-Yes?

282
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,059
I just remembered something.

283
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,497
When Komugi lost her mom…

284
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,603
Who do you think that guy
talking to Someda is?

285
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,371
I'm not sure.

286
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,740
But I feel like I've seen him before.

287
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,342
Thank you.

288
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,351
Attorney,

289
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,386
forgive me.

290
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,326
I went to that ramen stall again.

291
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,027
How was it?

292
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,496
He did tell me a bunch of things,

293
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,034
but nothing that's related
to the DNA test report.

294
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,403
Roger that.

295
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,106
Anyway, I'm thinking
I'll take that recording with me

296
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,376
and have another meeting with Tomoya Endo.

297
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,446
Will you tell Komugi about that recording?

298
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,982
I'm thinking not yet.

299
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,818
Yes, that's probably the cool option.

300
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,154
It's not about whether it's cool or not.

301
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,128
I'll call you later.

302
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,634
Komugi?

303
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,703
Why might you be here?

304
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,905
What about going home?

305
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,842
Well? Answer.

306
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:18,877
You promised, right?

307
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,680
-Yes.
-What's with the spinning?

308
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:28,086
So you broke your promise
and went to meet your aunt.

309
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:28,987
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,826
Then you ran into Kamii.
Well, he was probably lying in wait.

311
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,995
And then…

312
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,799
I… trust my father.

313
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,468
When he's not even your real father?

314
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,471
He really said that?

315
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,609
Who do you think…

316
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,781
I really am?

317
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,151
What do you mean?

318
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,153
Do you think I'm…

319
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,991
really me?

320
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,962
I just…

321
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,866
I don't know what's what anymore.

322
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,846
HA

323
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,615
HAYASHIKAWA

324
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,751
UTA

00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,888
SON OF DEATH ROW INMATE TAKES REVENGE

326
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:44,963
HIGASHIKAYAMA INCIDENT
THE SOLE SURVIVOR, UTA HAYASHIKAWA

327
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,167
The incident happened in July of 2002.

328
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,336
At the time,

329
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,806
Uta Hayashikawa was six months old.

330
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,178
That means she was born in January 2002.

331
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,015
I was born on February 6th, 2003.

332
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,255
It's not me.

333
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,032
I'm not…

334
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,137
Uta Hayashikawa.

335
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,739
I'm not…

336
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,916
Chief Akazawa.

337
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,353
I spotted a man talking
to the ramen stall owner, Someda.

338
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,056
I looked into it and he's the lawyer
that came to meet Tomoya Endo.

339
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,592
Also, this is the report on Someda.

340
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,465
Around 30 years ago,

341
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,769
Someda was arrested for selling
baseball shirts with forged signatures.

342
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,043
Forged signatures?

343
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,013
A search also turned up
drugs in his possession.

344
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,714
-Drugs?
-Really?

345
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,651
He served two years in prison as a result.

346
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:15,587
Akisada,

347
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,657
give me your take on this.

348
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,558
Yes, sir.

349
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,394
I think Haruo Yamashita's letter

350
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,331
was written by Someda
at Tomoya Endo's behest.

351
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,706
Is that so?

352
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,780
PROSECUTOR ANAN

355
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,031
-Yes?
-It's Akazawa. I'm coming in.

356
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:11,510
I was just going through the documents
on Tomoya Endo that your side sent over.

357
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,280
-So you'll prosecute--
-Take action to rearrest Tomoya Endo.

358
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,615
On a murder charge.

359
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,351
Otherwise, I can't prosecute him.

360
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:25,023
There's insufficient objective evidence
that links the suspect to the crime.

361
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,825
You haven't made him crack.

362
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,227
Do you see that it's pointless?

363
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,595
Make him crack?

364
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,598
You still want us
to get a confession out of him?

365
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,633
Yes.

366
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,935
Did he get a lawyer already?

367
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,638
-No.
-That's perfect.

368
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,407
Make him crack before he gets a lawyer.

369
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,478
I'm sure you're already aware,
Prosecutor Anan,

370
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,647
but an arrest has
always led to prosecution

371
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,183
in cases handled by our department.

372
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,753
If you try to get out of prosecuting him,

373
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:59,558
then from now on,
no one will ever follow your lead.

374
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,360
Please don't make me laugh.

375
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:08,300
You think the blame would fall on me
for breaking an old tradition?

376
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,203
I think not.

377
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,608
Not providing strong evidence
that could withstand a trial

378
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,376
is incompetence on your part.

379
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,113
Don't act like it isn't.

380
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,150
Do you not want justice for the victim?

381
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:30,288
I'm told Mr. Haruo Yamashita
used to be one of you, was he not?

382
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,192
The suspect is just a youngster
unrelated to any criminal groups.

383
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,828
Can the MPD not even get
someone like that to talk?

384
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,432
All right.

385
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,969
We'll focus on making the suspect talk.

386
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,339
Make that your sole priority.

387
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,008
One more thing.

388
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,812
We found a letter that Mr. Yamashita wrote

389
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,548
to his daughter
right before he was killed.

390
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,650
This is a copy of it.

391
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,492
THAT PERSON HAS BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED

392
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,062
What do you make of this?

393
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:15,133
I don't think it was
Mr. Yamashita who wrote this.

394
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,636
I see.

395
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,071
If you'll excuse me.

396
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,682
Welcome back, sir.

397
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,256
That really narrows our options.

398
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,493
What did you think, Akisada?

399
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,696
What the hell does she think our job is?

400
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,032
She just climbed
the ranks through connections.

401
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,534
She'll be back at the MOJ soon enough.

402
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,036
We just have to wait it out.

403
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,004
I guess so.

404
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,807
I don't know why the prosecutor higher-ups

405
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,511
care about the first female
department supervisor or whatever.

406
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,247
All I know is,

407
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,751
she won't last long at this job.

408
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:09,921
Not as a woman.

409
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,357
I'm sure.

410
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,662
Make Tomoya Endo crack, huh?

411
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,198
Whatever the case,

412
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,202
the person who holds
the key to it all is Someda.

413
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,104
Here you go.

414
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,206
Hello, it's Anan.

415
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,141
It's about the Higashikayama matter.

416
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,479
The letter from Haruo Yamashita came up.

417
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,482
His daughter gave it to the investigators.

418
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,350
DELICIOUSNESS GUARANTEED

419
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,485
I see.

420
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,687
I'm out right now.

421
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,288
I'll call back later.

422
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,259
Busy as always, aren't you?

423
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,229
I certainly am.

424
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,618
Yes?

425
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,588
Hey, would it be okay
if I come in a bit late today?

426
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:54,192
It's fine, but you can take
the day off if you feel unwell.

427
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,160
No, that's not it.

428
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:56,828
It's just an errand.

429
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,063
An errand?

430
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,066
Um…

431
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,070
I'll definitely be there by noon.

432
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,774
Okay, sure.

433
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,243
Just don't act on your own again.

434
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:14,779
Okay.

435
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,587
ADDRESS - FAMILY REGISTER

436
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,491
-Customer number A004.
-Next person, please.

437
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,296
Please head to counter number 307.

438
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,800
Coming.

439
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,536
I'm coming.

440
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,346
I'm Nishijin from the police station.

441
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,849
-You're Mr. Susumu Someda, right?
-Yes.

442
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,219
Could we have a word
with you at the station again?

443
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,486
Sure.

444
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,289
Could you wait while I go
turn off the heat on my stove?

445
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,128
Okay.

446
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,478
Hello?

447
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,814
The police just came here.

448
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,894
Let's go.

449
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:48,072
Afternoons are a drag

450
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,341
Afternoons are a drag, a real…

451
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,912
Afternoons are a drag

452
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,182
A real drag

453
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,784
-Asakusa?
-Old guy's shop.

454
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,087
-Made in Germany.
-Damn it! I shouldn't have told you.

455
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,623
What are you up to?

456
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,392
Can't you tell? I'm making curry.

457
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,327
-With fish cakes?
-With fish cakes.

458
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,461
Why curry though?

459
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,698
That's like asking a mountaineer
why they climb mountains.

460
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,200
Wait. No, it's not.

461
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,237
How did you know
just from "old guy in Asakusa"?

462
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,939
You underestimate my power.

463
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,677
That's so not cool.

464
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,612
Afternoons are a drag

465
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,314
So hard

466
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,649
Potatoes are so hard

467
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,718
-Hey.
-Yes?

468
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,386
What do you think about it?

469
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,190
About Komugi and Uta Hayashikawa
potentially being the same person?

470
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,459
It's just that reporter's conjecture.

471
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,961
At least, I think so. But…

472
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,162
But?

473
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,431
He seems weirdly confident about it.

474
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:49,300
I can't help but think
he's still hiding something.

475
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,937
You think so?

476
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,909
-So why curry?
-Drop it. What are you? A prosecutor?

477
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,747
You really like that one, don't you?
Is that your new catchphrase?

478
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,718
-"What are you? A prosecutor?"
-Stop.

479
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,519
Sorry for being late.

480
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,122
-Welcome!
-You're very late. Where were you?

481
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,795
A copy of your family register?

482
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,264
You haven't checked it?

483
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:25,837
Well, I was… too scared to do it alone.

484
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,574
Of course you are!

485
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,409
I would feel the same if I were you.

486
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,211
I wouldn't be able to stay cool.

487
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:39,283
I just don't want this
to hang over me forever.

488
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,586
Sure.

489
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,188
Go ahead then.

490
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,888
Komugi?

491
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,561
FATHER: HARUO YAMASHITA
MOTHER: SHIZUKA YAMASHITA

492
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,363
RELATION: ELDEST DAUGHTER

493
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,198
Thank goodness.

494
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:35,873
If I was Uta Hayashikawa,
it would say "adopted" here, right?

495
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,941
Yes.

496
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,176
If that's the case,

497
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:43,381
that DNA test report
has to be fake, right?

498
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,090
What's with that Kamii person?

499
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,892
Making up a bunch of nonsense.

500
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,063
What's wrong with my aunt?
All this for my dad's inheritance?

501
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,399
They're all a bunch of liars!

502
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,668
Can't trust a thing, can you?

503
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:11,876
I'm definitely the one and only daughter

504
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,446
of Haruo Yamashita and Shizuka Yamashita.

505
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,416
Did you add the "definitely" there…

506
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,589
because you're still
not fully sure inside?

507
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:25,756
Teru!

508
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,331
I won't blame you
for wanting to trust your parents.

509
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:38,236
But if you start questioning things like
the DNA test, there will be no end to it.

510
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,905
The fact that your aunt agreed to the test

511
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,941
means she probably had
an inkling, didn't she?

512
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:48,713
Here.

513
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,716
Someda, the ramen stall owner.

514
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,385
He has a criminal record.

515
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,389
I got curious and looked into him.

516
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,660
I'd wager a guess
this is how he got to know your father.

517
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,629
You didn't know, did you?

518
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,132
No.

519
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,067
At the very least,

520
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,505
you can be sure there are things
your father never told you.

521
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,679
Do you think you know
everything about Haruo?

522
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,916
What do you even know about your father?

523
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,422
From now on, you might learn
even more things that are hard to swallow.

524
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:35,226
"The letter Dad left behind
might not be real!"

525
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,331
Honestly, if you act out every time
you start to have doubts like that,

526
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,668
I don't have the patience
to keep babysitting you!

527
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,670
-But--
-Let's calm down now.

528
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,105
Why don't we have lunch?

529
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,247
Here we go.

530
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
Thanks for the meal.

531
00:36:58,282 --> 00:36:59,617
Now, dig in.

532
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,055
Fish cake?

533
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,823
Oh, you noticed?

534
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,658
It's rare to put it in, right?

535
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,194
Wait, is this…

536
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,497
I was told to make some for you.

537
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,837
I just remembered something.

538
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,441
When Komugi lost her mom,

539
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:29,680
the shock from it made her
unable to taste whatever she ate.

540
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:36,354
Mr. Yamashita was worried,
so he made some fish cake curry for her.

541
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,423
He said it cheered her right back up.

542
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,660
Attorney,

543
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,664
I think Komugi might be going
through the same thing now.

544
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:53,638
If so, could you feed her
the same curry Mr. Yamashita made?

545
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,043
He asked you?

546
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,046
No guarantees about the taste.

547
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,889
Thank you for the meal.

548
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,404
How is it?

549
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,914
Ever since Dad passed away,

550
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,454
I couldn't taste anything,
no matter what I ate.

551
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,624
Even Mr. Someda's ramen.

552
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:52,029
It was the same when Mom died.

553
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,866
But why fish cake?

554
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,605
I liked both curry and fish cakes.

555
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,276
So maybe it would have some taste.

556
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,579
That's what Dad thought.

557
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,049
Komugi.

558
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,392
Well?

559
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,027
How is it?

560
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:29,834
It tastes good!

561
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,038
Really? It does? Good.

562
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,385
Dad looked…

563
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,257
super relieved when I said that.

564
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,907
No matter what anyone says,

565
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,979
to me,

566
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,717
the person who made
fish cake curry for me back then…

567
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,522
is my dad.

568
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,864
-Stupid Matsukaze.
-Wait, why?

569
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,101
It's a compliment. A cool one.

570
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:38,502
Just accept it.

571
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,371
No, I can't. You're stupid!

572
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,973
It tastes great!

573
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,446
Mr. Matsukaze, remember this.

574
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:56,053
Be a witness to my words.

575
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,556
I won't waver anymore.

576
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,195
I am… me.

577
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,033
I am Haruo Yamashita's daughter!

578
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:16,740
I trust my father,
as well as the letter he wrote.

579
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,376
I trust all of it!

580
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,451
Hearing that from you is very reassuring.

581
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,221
When I accepted this job,

582
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,357
I said I would go
and see the peacock with you.

583
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,592
Don't forget that.

584
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,029
As long as you will it,

585
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,432
I will be right beside you.

586
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:48,339
Let's trust both your father…

587
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,042
and his letter.

588
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,080
Yes.

589
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,785
You said you saw Mr. Yamashita

590
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,322
write the letter in front of you
the same day as the incident.

591
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,691
Is that true?

592
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,202
Tell the damn truth!

593
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,542
Did you forge Mr. Yamashita's letter?

594
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,745
Who asked you to do it?

595
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,316
Was it this lawyer
you talked to just recently?

596
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,488
Or was it Tomoya Endo?

597
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,395
Hey. It's time for your questioning.

598
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,633
Get walking already!

599
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,639
Detective.

600
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,978
The one who forged Mr. Yamashita's letter…

601
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,652
is me.

602
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,492
Let's hear the details.

603
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,082
Yes.

604
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,785
It's been taken care of.

605
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,561
The ramen stall owner won't be a problem.

606
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,357
You didn't see the most important thing.

607
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,758
Mister!

608
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,927
Stop being so condescending,
you damn lawyer!

609
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,195
I'll disclose everything.

610
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,364
Is there someone pulling the strings?

611
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,398
