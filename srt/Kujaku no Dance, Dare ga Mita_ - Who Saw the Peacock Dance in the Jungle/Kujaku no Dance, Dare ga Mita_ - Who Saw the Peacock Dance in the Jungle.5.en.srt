1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,072
On the night of Christmas Eve,

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,909
my father was murdered by someone.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,779
The person arrested as the primary suspect

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,214
was Tomoya Endo.

5
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:19,819
Tomoya was the son of Rikiro Endo,
a man who received the death penalty

6
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,690
for murdering a family
22 years ago in Higashikayama.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,129
However, my father left me a letter
that spoke of false accusations.

8
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,799
The one who forged Mr. Yamashita's letter…

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,200
is me.

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:38,805
I said that I forged Mr. Yamashita's
letter under Tomoya Endo's orders.

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,306
I lied.

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:46,513
His admission of forging the letter
was a result of someone's coercion.

13
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,515
Mr. Someda!

14
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,416
He's not here.

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,551
I lost sight of Someda.

16
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,154
-Find him right now!
-Yes, sir!

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,755
Komugi.

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,390
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,193
For not telling you the truth.

20
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,798
I hope you can reach it.

21
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,502
Time of death, 6:55 p.m.

22
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,414
-There's no mistaking it. That's Someda.
-Yes.

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,251
Going by his actions before his death,
do you think it was suicide?

24
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,521
No, it's too early
to be sure that it was suicide.

25
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,559
The medical examiner said
they would conduct an autopsy.

26
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,064
-Are those Someda's belongings?
-Yes, sir.

27
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,733
I borrowed these from the storage room.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,603
This bag contains everything they found.

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,112
KOMUGI

30
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,321
The call went through.

31
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,657
Mr. Someda? Where are you right now?

32
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,725
Komugi.

33
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,828
It's me, Akazawa.

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,263
What?

35
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,701
Keep calm and listen.

36
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,270
This evening,

37
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,740
Someda was found floating in a river.

38
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,244
He was transferred to a hospital

39
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,813
where he ultimately died.

40
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:31,985
What?

41
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,220
That can't be.

42
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,855
The cause of death?

43
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,227
We won't know until the autopsy is done.

44
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,563
However, when they found his belongings,

45
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,066
his shoes and watch
had been neatly lined up,

46
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,635
so it might have been suicide.

47
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,804
That can't be.

48
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,843
There's no way.

49
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,145
You think Mr. Someda…

50
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,681
did that to himself?

51
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,050
No.

52
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,086
He told me…

53
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,760
that he had betrayed Dad.

54
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,029
He cried and apologized to me.

55
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:16,930
He also…

56
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,499
Promise me, Mr. Someda.

57
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,801
Promise me you won't go anywhere.

58
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,769
Okay.

59
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,804
I promise.

60
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,343
He promised me.

61
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,816
I'm told that during his questioning,

62
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,821
Mr. Someda said he forged Mr. Yamashita's
letter under Tomoya Endo's orders.

63
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,559
But he told Komugi that he had lied.

64
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,829
I see.

65
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,967
We'll see if we can verify that.

66
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,436
However,

67
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,807
the written statement
from Someda about the letter

68
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,544
counts as legitimate evidence.

69
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,883
-But that's…
-Please wait.

70
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,287
Just because he signed a document
doesn't mean the contents are true.

71
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,558
We conducted Someda's questioning
in an entirely lawful manner.

72
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,465
Someda gave his testimony
of his own free will

73
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,501
and left behind a signed statement.

74
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,373
I have work to do, so if you'll excuse me.

75
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,880
Mr. Akazawa!

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,817
Back there,

77
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,220
what did you mean?

78
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,989
He admitted it of his own free will?

79
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,895
That's not true.

80
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,631
He was just…

81
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,770
being used by someone else.

82
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,010
Listen, Komugi.

83
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,647
I get that you want
to honor your father's wishes.

84
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,149
But I'll warn you.

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,953
Put some space between yourself and him
before that lawyer tricks you.

86
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,755
Understood?

87
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,860
I've been your father's friend,
and I've known you for a long time.

88
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,896
Take my advice.

89
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,035
Don't pick the wrong path.

90
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,750
What did he say?

91
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,755
Nothing.

92
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,390
Not much.

93
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,446
Dad…

94
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,218
Mr. Someda…

95
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,230
Our only lead into the jungle…

96
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,467
is now gone.

97
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,908
Thanks for walking me home.

98
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,343
No problem.

99
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,614
I'm sure you're exhausted
from everything that has happened today.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,015
Just rest for today.

101
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,051
You don't have to come in
for work tomorrow.

102
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,287
I won't take the day off.

103
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,622
Why not?

104
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,527
I have even more reasons
to head to the jungle now.

105
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,496
Also,

106
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,800
I made a promise to you.

107
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,602
That I will not

108
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,305
waver anymore.

109
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,677
That's why I'll trust my father…

110
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,347
as well as Mr. Someda.

111
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,052
I'll trust them both.

112
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,356
Okay, I get it.

113
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,495
Also,

114
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:44,997
there's this.

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,802
I heard from a friend of mine

116
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,840
that she met my father
at the courthouse a few times last year.

117
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,309
At the courthouse?

118
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,778
Those are the dates he was there.

119
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,852
Okay then, I'll look into this.

120
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,856
One more thing.

121
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,592
About…

122
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,097
that video of my father
that you talked about.

123
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,967
What does it…

124
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,636
It will be faster for you
to just watch it.

125
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,840
Okay.

126
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,642
Bye then.

127
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,987
But when Rikiro
received his death sentence,

128
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,155
I thought…

129
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,059
A certain thought began to plague my mind.

130
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,796
Come on, I asked for extra broth.
This has barely any broth in it.

131
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,999
Don't make me write a bad review.

132
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,433
Rikiro,

133
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,671
is not the person…

134
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,875
that's responsible for the murders.

135
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,278
If that's true,

136
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,481
then go and announce that
in a press conference or whatever else.

137
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,384
Well, I would do that if I could.

138
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,154
Right now, I'm trying to gather proof.

139
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,890
-You're just going to feign ignorance?!
-That's not it.

140
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,061
Mr. Kamii, please--

141
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,435
I see you're about to boil over.

142
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,771
Natural reaction, really.

143
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,205
Right?

144
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,842
Do you actually have any idea
of who the true culprit is?

145
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,215
I do have a good idea.

146
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,619
Who is it? Catch them right now!

147
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,456
I still…

148
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,025
don't have enough proof.

149
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,465
The only one who knows it all…

150
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,569
is the peacock.

151
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,505
The peacock?

152
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,882
Which jungle are you hiding in?

153
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,020
My little peacock.

154
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,823
Rikiro…

155
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,793
is not the person…

156
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,198
that's responsible for the murders.

157
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,701
I need a minute.

158
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,707
I can't blame her for that.

159
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,779
Now that Mr. Someda is dead,

160
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,882
we can't prove that he lied
in his statement to the police.

161
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,051
There's a high likelihood

162
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,354
that the statement he signed
will be accepted in court.

163
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,893
The autopsy results

164
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,463
state that a large quantity of drugs
were detected in Someda's system.

165
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,933
However,

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,105
Komugi insists that someone
was manipulating him behind the scenes.

167
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:18,210
Then, do you think he was killed
in order to stop him from talking?

168
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,279
I can't say just yet.

169
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,014
As per our last update,

170
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,918
Someda admitted to forging the letter
alleged to be from Mr. Yamashita.

171
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,222
There's a high likelihood his death is
connected to the murder of Mr. Yamashita.

172
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,962
That is to say, it's possible
that Someda was murdered.

173
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,437
Did you learn anything
from the list that Komugi gave you?

174
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,275
It might just be a coincidence,
but on one of the days on the list,

175
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,244
I was defending someone in a trial.

176
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,182
-What?
-I was at the courthouse that day too.

177
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,018
-How about the other days?
-They seem unrelated.

178
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,387
So it's just a coincidence?

179
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,091
At any rate, we should look into
what was going on at court

180
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,359
on the other days as well.

181
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,598
I wonder if we could find a lawyer
who was handling a case those days.

182
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,500
Wait.

183
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,903
There's a mailing list
for defense attorneys, right?

184
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,405
Maybe we could ask there.

185
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,007
A decent number of people
are subscribed to it.

186
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,343
-Okay, let's do that.
-Roger.

187
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,178
But still,

188
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:32,351
why did Haruo put my name
in the letter in the first place?

189
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,788
Did he happen to watch me
in a trial by chance?

190
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,225
No, that seems too unlikely.

191
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,029
I'm sorry. I'm okay now.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,168
Hey, Komugi.

193
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:51,971
Yes?

194
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,174
If this is too tough for you,

195
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,779
then it's okay for you
to quit this job, you know.

196
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,280
What?

197
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,784
You've already fulfilled
your father's request by consulting Teru.

198
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:06,886
So, you know,

199
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,790
you don't have to force yourself
to suffer anymore.

200
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,395
Just let Teru handle everything!

201
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,964
Look. Throw it all his way.

202
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,099
Just like that.

203
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,003
You can take some time away from all this.

204
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,071
How about it?

205
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,846
You're right.

206
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,184
Maybe that's what I should do.

207
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,688
There's no point in me being here.

208
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,724
Is that what you expected me to say?

209
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,526
What?

210
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,995
I'll never say that. Mark my words.

211
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,531
-You don't have to act tough--
-I will act tough!

212
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,469
Mr. Matsukaze.

213
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,976
I think Dad's death
and the Higashikayama murders…

214
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,680
are linked. Isn't that right?

215
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,417
Get ready to go out.

216
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,252
What? Go where?

217
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,723
We're going to go and meet Tatsuo Mikita,
a person whose name was in the letter.

218
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,392
The defense attorney
in the Higashikayama case?

219
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,863
Right now, he's our only lead.

220
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,830
What will you do?

221
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,267
I'll go.

222
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,246
There's no need to rush.

223
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,516
-What?
-Let your heart catch up slowly.

224
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,655
You know how in the morning, people need
some time before they're fully awake?

225
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,759
They move around and stretch
in order to get their bodies active.

226
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,662
It's okay to take it slow.

227
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,064
Just don't force yourself.

228
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,268
I'll wait until you're fully awake.

229
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,512
Dad, you must have known
what kind of person Mr. Matsukaze is.

230
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,916
That's why you wrote
his name in the letter.

231
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,295
I'm not quitting the job, okay?

232
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,731
-Definitely not.
-I know.

233
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,638
MIKITA

234
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,812
Welcome.

235
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,515
-Mr. Matsukaze, the attorney, yes?
-Yes.

236
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,217
Come on in.

237
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,023
You're looking into
the Higashikayama incident?

238
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,091
Yes.

239
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,894
-Don't mind us. I'll handle it.
-Okay.

240
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:07,333
I haven't been involved with it
for quite some time now.

241
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,602
I quit being a lawyer
for health reasons, you see.

242
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,405
You can sit more comfortably.
Feel free to eat this.

243
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,511
As far as the Higashikayama case goes,

244
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,915
I feel like I failed Rikiro.

245
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,885
That's why when Mr. Haruo Yamashita
came to visit me,

246
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,154
I recommended you to him.

247
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,423
Recommended?

248
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,360
Why me?

249
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,998
I thought maybe you would be able
to do something about it, Mr. Matsukaze.

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,238
The first time I saw you
was at a criminal trial workshop.

251
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:54,213
How many times has your client been
arrested for drug abuse?

252
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,416
Three times. They have been
my client since the first time.

253
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,219
They denied any wrongdoing
during my first meeting with them,

254
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,354
so I moved things along accordingly.

255
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,392
But in today's meeting, they said
they had knowingly used the drugs.

256
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,963
When they got arrested another time,
I was honestly quite disappointed.

257
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,465
Happens all the time.

258
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,667
But at the same time,

259
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,803
I was glad.

260
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,539
Glad?

261
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,576
Admitting to their wrongdoing is a sign
that they're willing to improve.

262
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,448
When I met them after their rearrest,
they were a lot more open with me.

263
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,752
Even criminals are capable of change.

264
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,289
Although they certainly
don't make it easy on others.

265
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,160
But I think believing
that your client can improve themselves

266
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,097
is the responsibility
of a defense attorney.

267
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,700
It also leads to a future
with fewer victims.

268
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,936
That's what I believe.

269
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,308
You know what I thought
after hearing that?

270
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,078
"This attorney is really plain."

271
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,781
-What?
-And that plainness is what's good.

272
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,252
You know, it's easier to trust
that kind of person

273
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,987
than one who's self-important.

274
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,622
Am I being complimented or not?

275
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:15,060
I'd say being a respectable person
is more important than anything.

276
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:22,968
I truly thought that you would
earnestly take on the Higashikayama case,

277
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,004
which is why I referred you to him.

278
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,877
Do you know why my father came to you?

279
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,681
He visited me out of the blue one day.

280
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,886
He told me that he believed Rikiro Endo

281
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,323
wasn't the culprit
behind the Higashikayama murders.

282
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,593
Rikiro,

283
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,795
is not the person…

284
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,966
that's responsible for the murders.

285
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,602
I was shocked.

286
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,206
It was a case I had
fully devoted myself to in the past,

287
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,009
and now its very foundation
was being challenged.

288
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,945
That said,

289
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,048
I didn't find it hard to believe.

290
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,622
Maybe it had never
quite fallen into place inside me.

291
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,025
I had always questioned

292
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,496
whether Rikiro really was the culprit.

293
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,998
What?

294
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,968
That sentiment was revived once again.

295
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,770
By Mr. Yamashita.

296
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,107
After that,

297
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,044
we talked about the victims,
the Hayashikawa family.

298
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,313
The Hayashikawa family?

299
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,687
ROBBERY AND MURDER CASE

300
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,558
Maybe you two are already aware,

301
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,894
but the Hayashikawa family
was well-known as an affluent household.

302
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,998
Akihiro Hayashikawa was an entrepreneur
with Noriko as his wife,

303
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,501
and their son was Yasunari.

304
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:08,273
Then Yasunari got married
and had a son named Souta.

305
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:14,346
From the outside, it seemed
that the family faced no hardships.

306
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,215
But it wasn't so.

307
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,984
The grandson of the family, Souta,

308
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:24,823
developed slower than other boys his age,
which caused the family some concern.

309
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,294
His mother, Satoko, had been
secretly seeing a psychiatrist

310
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,364
as a result of the stress from that.

311
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,868
Some time after that,
their eldest daughter, Oto, was born,

312
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:41,240
and half a year before the incident,
Uta was born.

313
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,209
Uta…

314
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,050
Then, that family was brutally murdered.

315
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,519
In the aftermath,

316
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,423
there was only one person
who regularly visited their residence,

317
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,760
had sufficient motive to commit
the crime, and didn't have an alibi.

318
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,130
That was Mr. Rikiro Endo.

319
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,601
When Rikiro learned that his son, Tomoya,

320
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,205
was zealously investigating
the Higashikayama case,

321
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,143
he said he wanted his son
to focus on living his own life,

322
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,747
and he abandoned
his request for a retrial.

323
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:27,252
So he admitted to the charges
in order to protect Tomoya?

324
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,255
That's how it came across to me.

325
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,793
Excuse me, but do you know
what happened to Uta?

326
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,865
Let me think. I believe
she was taken in by a relative.

327
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,068
-Do you have that person's contact info?
-Yes, I do.

328
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,372
I believe their name was Tsujii.

329
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,740
Tsujii?

330
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,444
Is their full name perhaps Kouta Tsujii?

331
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,512
That's the one.

332
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,481
That name was in the letter.

333
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,222
Here, you can have these.
You seemed to like them.

334
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,725
And here's Mr. Tsujii's phone number.

335
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,826
Thank you.

336
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:13,231
I wish I could hand you my case notes,
but the law has changed and now I can't.

337
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,600
You've given more than enough information.

338
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,270
Come visit again
if you need to ask anything else.

339
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,638
Thank you.

340
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,275
But still, it's a wonder
that a single letter led to all this.

341
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,313
Ms. Yamashita,
look after Mr. Matsukaze, would you?

342
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,617
-Can I ask something?
-Sure.

343
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:37,622
What kind of person
was my father in your eyes, Mr. Mikita?

344
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,427
He was a very

345
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,497
righteous person.

346
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,566
Yes.

347
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,971
He had a respectable look on his face.

348
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,378
Almost like yours.

349
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,446
Sorry?

350
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,781
Oh, nothing.

351
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,916
Thank you for these.

352
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:16,094
So the person
who introduced you to my father

353
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,930
ended up being Mr. Mikita.

354
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,335
Honestly, I'm relieved to know that.

355
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,838
It kept bugging me why he had picked me.

356
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:34,913
The reason Haruo came to the courthouse
was probably to see me in action.

357
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,484
It feels weird to know

358
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,289
that I was in the same place
as your father.

359
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,801
You know,

360
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:01,706
I'm actually really glad…

361
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,411
that it was your name
my father wrote in the letter.

362
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,079
-Now, at least.
-"Now, at least"?

363
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,248
Only now? Isn't that a bit late?

364
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,218
See, this kind of stuff
is why it took until now.

365
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,620
I'll keep that in mind.

366
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:21,760
Well,

367
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,330
people who help you
when you're feeling helpless

368
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,299
often seem better than they actually are.

369
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,270
Back there, Mr. Mikita
called me respectable,

370
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,873
but he's totally off the mark.

371
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,545
I just make sure to appear that way.

372
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,417
It's all just pretense.

373
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,886
To tell the truth, I'm…

374
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,528
It's getting cold. Let's go.

375
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,305
Mr. Someda passed away yesterday.

376
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,410
Is that…

377
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,915
an outcome you expected?

378
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,657
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

379
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,926
I heard about Someda's death.

380
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,494
Nonetheless,

381
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,598
you still have a statement
signed by him, don't you?

382
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,203
About that,
Mr. Yamashita's daughter claims

383
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,406
that Someda was ordered
to lie in it by someone else.

384
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,176
We're trying to verify it right now.

385
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,179
His call history supports that idea.

386
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,882
Someda has died.

387
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,184
Is that so?

388
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:54,786
Was it…

389
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,521
Surely not, right?

390
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,423
Of course not.

391
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,761
-Is something wrong?
-No, nothing.

392
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,600
Shall I take it that Someda's
statement can't be used?

393
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:13,004
Didn't he use drugs?
Perhaps he just called his dealer.

394
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,942
I think that's a likely possibility,
but we're covering our bases.

395
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,646
If we can't use Someda's statement,

396
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,117
we can't establish Mr. Yamashita's
letter as being fabricated.

397
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,554
Are you telling me
it hasn't even been useful

398
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,823
as a way to get Tomoya Endo to talk?

399
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,059
-Not yet.
-"Not yet"?

400
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,829
I guess I should just sit here
and hope for good news.

401
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,098
I'll keep trying.

402
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,835
One more thing.

403
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,272
Someda's death
hasn't made the news, right?

404
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,277
The news did report that the man
found in the river ended up dying,

405
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,048
but any connection between
Someda's death and Mr. Yamashita's murder

406
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,350
hasn't been reported on.

407
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,621
Even if the statement is legitimate,
it's best to avoid media attention.

408
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,824
I'd like you to resolve
the matter before that happens.

409
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,694
We can't call Someda to the stand anymore,

410
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:15,533
so we have to make sure to get some use
out of the statement you took from him.

411
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:21,306
I'll personally handle
Ms. Komugi Yamashita.

412
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,375
Whatever you do,

413
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,878
don't let the public know about
the relation to the Higashikayama case.

414
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,949
I can count on you
to do at least that, right?

415
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,152
Understood.

416
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,224
If you'll excuse us.

417
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,112
This thing is super sensational.

418
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,948
Shall we launch some good old fireworks?

419
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:08,453
Let's launch them real high,

420
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,489
shall we, Editor-in-chief?

421
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,797
MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF RAMEN STALL OWNER
A LINK TO THE HIGASHIKAYAMA INCIDENT

422
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,633
I don't get it.

423
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,370
Why would Ms. Anan want
to question Komugi herself?

424
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,975
Is she trying to score points
with her higher-ups by looking useful?

425
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,477
Is that it?

426
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,420
Akisada.

427
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,590
Look into that lawyer's background.

428
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,258
Understood, sir.

429
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,267
Kyoko, it's me.

430
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,770
I don't think I can be home
for dinner tonight.

431
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:02,640
What? You need to tell me that sooner.

432
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,776
I'm all ready to make fried chicken.

433
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,246
Then how about you share some with Komugi?

434
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,782
I like that. I think I'll do so.

435
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,618
Fancy hearing you give
a good idea for once.

436
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,055
I've been worried about Komugi recently.

437
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,225
While you're at it,

438
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,428
can you do something for me?

439
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,131
Yes.

440
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,032
Oh, okay.

441
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,803
Got it. I'll give it to her.

442
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,073
Was that Dad?

443
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,575
Yes. He said he'll be late.

444
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,179
"Police" and "overwork"
go together like bread and butter.

445
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,547
Right, Kou?

446
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,183
You're a part of the police too.

447
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,285
You shouldn't say stuff like that.

448
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,419
Probably not.

449
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,756
Okay, I should get going.

450
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,793
-What? You're leaving now?
-I've got way too much paperwork.

451
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,662
Okay, good luck with that then.

452
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,533
-I'll be back later.
-Take care.

453
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:12,043
Tomoya, from now on,
if anything happens, contact me first.

454
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,913
First? What's that about?

455
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,683
Please refrain from contacting
that reporter, Kamii.

456
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,588
Any statement you make

457
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,457
will significantly influence
any upcoming trials.

458
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:31,162
Please refrain from making
careless statements, especially to Kamii.

459
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,835
That man pretends to be innocent
to earn your trust, but I promise you,

460
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,236
he's not.

461
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,841
So you're saying…

462
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,811
I should trust you

463
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,850
since you're so innocent and respectable?

464
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,659
Is that so, Mr. Attorney?

465
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,599
Yes, that's exactly so.

466
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,971
I'm amazed you can say that
with a straight face.

467
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,052
He's right. How do you have
the nerve to say that?

468
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,357
Nothing about you is respectable.

469
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,326
You just put on an act
to make people think you are.

470
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,396
Yoshiteru.

471
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,765
Dad is no longer…

472
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,802
going to come home, okay?

473
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:51,042
He said we should treat him
as if he's dead.

474
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,846
Those were his words.

475
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,880
FIFTH YEAR - CLASS TWO
KUZE

476
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,617
Why?

477
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,030
In a parking lot in Sumida City, Tokyo,

478
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,833
a police officer in his thirties
was arrested for stealing

479
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,470
a bag filled with cash from a car.

480
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,776
Mom and Dad

481
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,078
got a divorce.

482
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,347
MATSUKAZE

483
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:33,418
From now on, you'll be
Matsukaze instead of Kuze.

484
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,355
But no matter what,

485
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:44,395
let's both live respectable lives, okay?

486
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:52,704
If the word "respectable"
means being proper and upright,

487
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:57,308
then haven't you been that way until now?

488
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,112
Okay.

489
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,056
That must have been

490
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,594
a defensive measure for you two
to avoid any more pain.

491
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,701
I still don't know where my dad went.

492
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,706
Where the hell are you?

493
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:30,875
Tell me.

494
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,744
Are you even alive?

495
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,790
There's not a single part of you
that's respectable.

496
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:50,028
All you do is engage in pretense
to appear as such.

497
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,070
HIGASHIKAYAMA POLICE STATION

498
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,839
And if that's the case…

499
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,643
I am… me.

500
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,415
I am Haruo Yamashita's daughter!

501
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,320
You're the one that's truly respectable.

502
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,962
I got a response about that list
after asking in the mailing list.

503
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,664
Ever heard of Attorney Narukawa?

504
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,636
NO, I HAVEN'T

505
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,209
He handled the case
that Haruo attended in court.

506
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,644
What?

507
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,782
Mr. Narukawa said
he comes to the area often,

508
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,685
so he'll drop by our office
when he's here next time.

509
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,458
PEEK
STAY COOL

510
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,293
STAY COOL

511
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,594
What the heck is this?

512
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,897
STAY COOL
HASAMI OFFICIAL STICKERS

513
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,833
STAY COOL
OKAY!

514
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,070
IN AUSTRIA!

515
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,873
When would you even use that?

516
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,544
That's so not respectable.

517
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,785
Ms. Kyoko.

518
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,054
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

519
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,424
-Come in.
-Don't mind if I do.

520
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,601
Sorry for calling all of a sudden.

521
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,003
I wanted to eat dinner together.

522
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,372
It made me really happy.

523
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,208
I was just wondering what to eat.

524
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,511
That's good to hear.

525
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:49,947
Try it.

526
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,183
Go for this one. Right here.

527
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,456
-How is it?
-Delicious.

528
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,625
Great! That's good.

529
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,228
Cute, isn't he?

530
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,198
They're all of Kou.

531
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,170
You wouldn't believe it.
He dotes on him more than his own son.

532
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,638
More than Mamoru?

533
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,941
But he really is cute.

534
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,480
I'm still a bit surprised.

535
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:28,052
You took a break from university
and started working at a law firm?

536
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,088
Yes.

537
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:40,031
Put some space between yourself and him
before that lawyer tricks you.

538
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,633
Don't pick the wrong path.

539
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,938
What's wrong?

540
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,612
Listen, Ms. Kyoko.

541
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,484
About me working at the law firm,

542
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:07,558
could you keep that a secret
from Mr. Akazawa?

543
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:13,864
Okay, sure.

544
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,167
It's a secret.

545
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,403
I'm sorry.

546
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,841
Don't worry.
I keep plenty of secrets from him too.

547
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,276
Really?

548
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,714
When you get to be our age,

549
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:35,186
you're practically connected by secrets.

550
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,557
For example,

551
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,996
I once started stock trading
using my own secret savings.

552
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,533
I made some risky trades
and lost a ton of money.

553
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,935
Don't tell my husband, okay?

554
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,770
You really did that?

555
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,839
Oh, right.

556
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,076
I brought some coffee beans.
You want to make some later?

557
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,178
Sure.

558
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,452
-You brought your own water?
-Yes.

559
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,590
This water really brings out
the aroma of the coffee.

560
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,358
It makes a huge difference.

561
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,260
Really?

562
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,731
I can get obsessed
about the strangest things.

563
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,071
Do you mind if I ask
what kind of person that lawyer is?

564
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,540
What kind of person?

565
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,576
As long as you will it,

566
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,446
I will be right beside you.

567
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,281
Just don't force yourself.

568
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,917
I'll wait until you're fully awake.

569
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,890
He seems a bit cold at first glance,

570
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,494
but he's actually a very kind person.

571
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,768
But he also…

572
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,871
Back there, Mr. Mikita
called me respectable,

573
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,907
but he's totally off the mark.

574
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,912
I just make sure to appear that way.

575
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,914
It's all just pretense.

576
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,219
Not respectable, huh?

577
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,691
I just keep losing

578
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,261
people who are important to me.

579
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,333
But I've managed to avoid feeling alone…

580
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,272
because of Mr. Matsukaze.

581
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,344
It doesn't matter
if he's respectable or not.

582
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,116
I'm grateful to him.

583
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,052
I should have told him that.

584
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:54,392
You're a strong girl, Komugi.

585
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,561
What?

586
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,366
To be capable of being
vulnerable in front of others,

587
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,703
if you ask me,

588
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,572
is a sign of strength.

589
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,414
Ms. Kyoko…

590
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,163
It's okay.

591
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,466
It will all be okay.

592
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,750
Please come again soon.

593
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,119
If you say that, I'll actually do it.

594
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,690
Oh, one more thing.

595
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:01,959
Here.

596
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,794
What's this?

597
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,766
Wow, it's Kou.

598
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,102
My husband got it from a shrine

599
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,039
that was famous for cats
since it looked just like Kou.

600
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,475
Look. We have matching ones.

601
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,277
It's so cute.

602
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,746
Thanks a lot.

603
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,216
See you later then.

604
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,384
See you later.

605
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,100
WE TALKED A LOT
I GAVE HER THE CHARM LIKE YOU ASKED

606
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,303
Chief.

607
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,039
Here's the detailed record on Matsukaze.

608
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,309
TARGET OF INVESTIGATION

609
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:13,531
MOBILE NUMBER

610
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,602
Hello?

611
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:22,473
I'm Anan, a prosecutor from
the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office.

612
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,744
I was wondering if I could have
your time to ask some questions

613
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,347
about your father, Haruo Yamashita.

614
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,483
What?

615
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,721
Your father made a clear statement.

616
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,459
That Rikiro Endo was not the culprit
behind the Higashikayama case.

617
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:47,831
He believed Rikiro Endo wasn't the culprit
behind the Higashikayama murders.

618
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,833
Rikiro,

619
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,936
is not the person…

620
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,371
that's responsible…

621
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,209
for the murders.

622
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,286
It seems that Matsukaze's father

623
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,388
used to be a police officer.

624
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,363
Akazawa.

625
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,266
I'm…

626
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,670
always watching.

627
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,474
Matsukaze is…

628
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,510
Mr. Kuze's son?

629
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,686
Tomorrow,

630
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,089
I'll meet with her.

631
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,758
Komugi Yamashita.

632
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,160
I see.

633
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:55,165
I wanted a good pair of eyes
and ears to check for me

634
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:59,470
just how much of the full picture
she's managed to uncover.

635
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,604
Understood.

636
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,107
I'm once again led to realize

637
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:08,545
that I am truly a coward.

638
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,217
What do I do?

639
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,568
Hello, Mr. Matsukaze? I just…

640
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,655
I'll lend you a hand.

641
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,425
-I hate it.
-That's a lie.

642
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,160
Something happened in the past!

643
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,861
I'll do whatever I can.

644
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,363
I want to know it all.

645
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,297
FATE STRIKES

646
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,331
