177
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,850
You know, last night...

178
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,122
"Last night"? Did I do something bad last night?

179
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:36,231
I don't remember anything.

180
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,105
I'm going to run first. You follow.

181
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,194
Eat slowly.

182
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,860
I feel better now.

183
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,886
Here. It's yours.

184
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,910
You're the best.

185
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,039
If you know, be nice to me.

186
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,109
You are going to the gym today, right?

187
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:29,819
Yes, I should. Why?

188
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:35,559
Nothing. I just saw you working out so hard, so I thought you were too tired.

189
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:39,304
I'm not tired at all. Let's go together later.

190
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:41,514
Yes, let's go together.

191
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,668
Are you already tired of it?

192
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,870
Why would I be? I'm feeling great!

193
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:50,329
Ouch!

194
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:06,184
Are you going to use this machine?

195
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:07,752
Sorry?

196
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:09,953
Why don't you sit on it first?

197
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,549
Put your legs down here.

198
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,637
And focus your strength in your abdominals.

199
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:28,421
- Why don't you try it?
- Okay.

200
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:33,711
So this is how you do it!

201
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,505
Can you feel the tension in your abs?

202
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:37,799
But don't push yourself at the beginning.

203
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,518
Try one set, and then stretching will be a good idea.

204
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,415
How long do I have to work out to become like you, Trainer?

205
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:47,408
It won't take long if you apply yourself.

206
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:50,380
I will teach you how I did it for myself.

207
00:15:57,286 --> 00:16:00,905
Sir, I would love to take a lesson.

208
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:02,106
Why don't we go to the front desk then?

209
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:03,590
Okay.

210
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,747
You should be nervous now.

211
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:11,332
Why?

212
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:13,718
- I will catch you up soon.
- You will?

213
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:17,839
Yes, I'm getting lessons from a personal trainer now.

214
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,550
So suddenly? Without telling me?

215
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,627

Not really.

218

Didn't you see his arms? They are huge!

219
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,867
I think they are too much.

220
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:45,180
His back is also incredibly muscular.

221
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,157
Hey, even I have that much muscle.

222
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,028
It's not something that just anyone can do easily.

223
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:53,471
So daebak!

224
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,623
It's not that awesome.

225
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:04,502
If I have a few more weeks of lessons, I think I'll start to develop muscles too.

226
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:07,087
It's tougher than it seems.

227
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:10,049
Look!

228
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,655
It is bigger already, isn't it? It has gotten bigger.

229
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,889
That hurts!

230
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:19,667
Your arm is still very soft.

231
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,253
If you're not going to be encouraging, don't speak.

232
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,047
I should tell the truth.

233
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:28,207
Yes, YOU'RE the best. TRULY the best.

234
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:30,903
From tomorrow, I will go to the gym by myself.

235
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,922
Hey, don't sulk.

236
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,276
Are you Chae Jin Wook?

237
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,833
Yes, I am.

238
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,360
You know Mr. Kim Jun Sik, right?

239
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,695
- Yes, I do know him–
- Regarding that,

240
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:51,065
when was the last time you saw Mr. Kim Jun Sik?

241

The last person who talked to Mr. Kim, the victim in this Yeonma-dong incident,

242
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,541
is you, Mr. Chae Jin Wook.

243

Today, let's take some time for group members to get to know each other.

You'll be doing group assignments together.

245
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,469
It would be good to get closer.

Yes, we've been working out for a while.

What about you guys?

265
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:31,492
Yes. We just got gym memberships.

00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:36,846
We go to the gym in the school.

00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:28,560
Doesn't it sound fun?

352
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:33,440
How about we meet on Thursday around 4:30 p.m.?

353
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,909
Let's meet in front of Future Hall.

354
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:38,095
- Okay.
- Okay.

355
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,197
I will prepare the stuff we need.

356
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,832
Let's gather on Thursday at 4:30 p.m.

357
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,103
That's all. You guys can leave.

358
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,688
All right. See you then.

359
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,773
Okay. Bye.

360
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:55,041
Why are we suddenly picking up trash?

361
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,731
And why do you buy supplies with your own money?

362
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,599
It's not that much money.

363
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,290
It's okay.

364
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,687
That's not the point.

365
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,332
Don't you think my pose has gotten better?

366
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:19,125
Bring your hips down more.

367
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,076
Now, sit.

368
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,699
Hi, Guys.

369
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:26,950
Hyung!

370
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,176
It's great weather out there.

371
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:29,636
Hello.

372
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:32,417
How is your workout going?

373
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:35,892
Since you're not around, it doesn't go well.

374
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:37,361
You're cute.

375
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:41,304
His exercise goes well... very well.

376
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:45,427
Well, good to hear that.

377
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:47,554
Don't strain yourself and take it easy.

378
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:49,676
I will take care of it.

379
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:52,251
What's wrong with you?

380
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,828
Hyung, he's always like that.

381
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,747
No, it's okay. I understand.

382
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:58,549
It can be upsetting for Sung Hoon.

383
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:00,650
Let's do the next exercise.

384
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:03,045
Oh, Hyung, I'll talk to you later!

385
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:05,221
Okay, do your best!

386
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:15,667
- So are you... jealous?
- Jealous about what?

387
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:19,045
Are you unhappy about P'Jin Wook and me getting close?

388
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,964
Why are you saying that?

389
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:24,117
It's true, though. You acted weirdly toward him earlier.

390
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:25,662
And you just yanked me away as I said goodbye to him.

391
00:26:25,662 --> 00:26:29,004
It's all because I care about you.

392
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,437
I...

393
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:33,497
Wouldn't you also do the same if your closest friend...

394
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:40,321
Why are you so careless? Look around you!

395
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:41,840
What?

396
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,249
I'm asking you to understand how I feel.

397
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,662
I...

398
00:26:47,662 --> 00:26:49,138
Please be careful.

399
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:51,850
I feel anxious when I look at how you act.

400
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:56,261
You're very friendly and expressive to people you don't even know that well.

401
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,509
That's how you become the next target.

402
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:03,111
What? "Target"?

403
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:05,738
What on earth are you talking about?

404
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,137
What the hell? Why do I have to be here?

405
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:14,765
Someone might overhear us.

406
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:17,016
Stop with the crap.

407
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:21,647
About Trainer Chae Jin Wook...

408
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,382
What about him?

409
00:27:23,382 --> 00:27:25,693
There are so many weird things about him.

410
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:28,870
Have you seen the wound on his body?

411
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:34,451
His phone calls in between sessions are also weird.

412
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:37,855
And what he packs for his weekly volunteer work is strange.

413
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:42,776
The news said the weapon might be a hand plow.

414
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:43,902
So?

415
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:46,363
I'm saying it's strange.

416
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:49,508
Did you think I would believe you when you said something like this?

417
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:51,327
What?

418
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:53,411
Have you any evidence?

419
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:56,874
No, but...

420
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:59,360
You can't so easily suspect someone like that.

421
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,507
Even if you are jealous of P'Jin Wook, suspecting him without evidence is wrong.

422
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:09,446
It's not like that.

423
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:14,167
Hey, Choi Sung Hoon, I never knew you were this kind of person. I'm disappointed in you.

424
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:17,035
Hey, I'm more disappointed in you!

425
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:18,354
How can you not trust me?

426
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:20,397
Haven't you ever suspected him?

427
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:22,149
No.

428
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,143
Forget it. If you can't trust me, get out of here.

429
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:27,087
Go and do whatever you want!

430
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:29,531
You're the suspicious one. Now you're getting angry at me.

431
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:30,645
Get out of here!

432
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,215
I will!

433
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:45,371
In the end, please remember that

434
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:50,711
relaxing the mind leads to relaxing the body's muscles.

435
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:54,465
Next week, we will do a practical on couple's squats.

436
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:58,327
Also, are your group activities going well?

437
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:00,270
<i>- Yes, Sir.</i>
- Good.

438
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,532
Then this ends today's lecture. Thank you, everyone.

439
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:06,434
<i>Thank you, Sir!</i>

440
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,864
I enjoy your YouTube videos.

441
00:29:10,864 --> 00:29:12,799
Thank you.

442
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:20,816
See you later at group-activity time.

443
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,378
Hey, Jay!

444
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,963
Hey, Ji Won.

445
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:37,049
Have you had a fight with Choi Sung Hoon?

446
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,136
I'm asking because you're always at the basketball court,

447
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:42,313
but I haven't seen you there for a few days.

448
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,307
I'm also busy with my own things.

449
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:48,569
Choi Sung Hoon had a long face too.

450
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:52,048
Why does he wear a long face, when he told me something weird?

451
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,441
Why? What did he say?

452
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:55,317
Nothing, he just told me a lot of nonsense.

453
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:58,121
He said that the person I like is a murderer.

454
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,990
Really? He said that?

455
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,076
Are you sure he wasn't joking?

456
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:05,486
Yes.

457
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:07,750
I was speechless.

458
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,790
How can he say such a damn silly thing?

459
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:13,794
His words might be trustworthy.

460
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:16,930
He could have said that since he feels something.

461
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:20,789
Do you think so?

462
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,563
You shouldn't trust people so easily.

463
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,894
Oh, I have a class! See you later.

464
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,970
Okay, bye bye.

465
00:30:34,692 --> 00:30:37,059
Can it even be true?

466
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,250
That's funny.

467
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,592
Just pick up trash for an hour.

468
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,760
<i>[Save Our Planet]</i>

469
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,807
<i>But does he have to avoid me like this?</i>

470
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,167
<i>He's definitely jealous.</i>

471
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,261
- Hey.
- Yes?

472
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:23,164
Are you close with Hyung Jin Wook?

473
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:26,001
Yes, quite close. We volunteer together too.

474
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:28,578
Well, I was thinking of joining that volunteer club,

475
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:34,091
so I thought I should hear how he is before I join the club.

476
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:39,372
Honestly, I don't really know.

477
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:42,733
It's hard to read him. He just always smiles.

478
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,600
Hyung?

479
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:37,917
One!

480
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:41,694
Okay, keep your knees at 90 degrees.

481
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:46,650
- No, it's strange. Why would he want to be right?
- Keep your back firm and straight.

482
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,121
Now, it's important to hold for 5 seconds.

483
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,947
Two!

484
00:32:53,992 --> 00:32:58,997
Okay, let's switch partners and do it again.

485
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:01,399
Let's switch partners.

486
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:09,731
When you are ready, let's do it again.

487
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,625
This time,

488
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:16,956
believe in each other and do it 10 times.

489
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:19,434
Okay, guys!

490
00:33:19,434 --> 00:33:22,168
One!

491
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:25,084
<i>I should become closer to him.</i>

492
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:28,254
<i>That way, I can get Jay away from the murderer.</i>

493
00:33:28,254 --> 00:33:32,025
<i>Do you think I will let you get close to Hyung Jin Wook?</i>

494
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:35,443
Okay, two!

495
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:38,932
Oh?

496
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:41,734
We have some passionate students here.

497
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:44,812
Well, this is it for today's lesson.

498
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:48,089
<i>Thank you, Sir!</i>

499
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:07,076
I have something to do so I will see you later at the gym.

500
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,574
Whatever.

501
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:13,234
What is it with him?

502
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:17,194
Why am I this interested in him?

503
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,700
Shit!

504
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,267
You surprised me!

505
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:32,902
Will you keep dawdling?

506
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:38,073
It's a group activity, but someone is resting while others work.

507
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:41,085
It's so hot today.

508
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:44,731
I'm working on it.

509
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:09,187
It's weirdly unpleasant.

510
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:13,098
Of course, you feel unpleasant when trying to remove the gum.

511
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,600
Shit!

512
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,230
It's disgusting!

513
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,845
- Here, take it.
- Hey! Nasty!

514
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:25,965
All sticky.

515
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,200
I guess you worked out hard.

516
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,211
Thank you.

517
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,467
Yes, I'm exhausted.

518
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,677
It looked like it.

519
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:50,414
By the way, do you have time this weekend?

520
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,016
Me?

521
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,459
I don't have any plans.

522
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:56,879
That's great! Do you want to come and volunteer with me?

523
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:58,865
Oh!

524
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:03,511
May I come, too?

525
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,530
Yes!

526
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,300
It's no trouble.

527
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:10,683
This works out well. We needed more help.

528
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:12,395
Yes, all right.

529
00:36:12,395 --> 00:36:14,929
I will come too!

530
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:19,619
Okay, I'll send you the time and location.

531
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,203
- See you this weekend.
- Yes.

532
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:23,864
Yes, Hyung.

533
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:30,227
Did you have to barge in between me and P'Jin Wook like that?

534
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:31,873
He said they needed more people,

535
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:34,466
so the more, the better.

536
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,526
You're very annoying.

537
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:41,286
Here, drink this.

538
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,584
Thank you.

539
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:53,349
- Hello.
- Hello.

540
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,510
- Hi!
- Thank you for coming today.

541
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,011
We wanted to come.

542
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:02,774
- Hey!
- Jay! It's so good to see you here.

543
00:37:02,774 --> 00:37:05,464
- Let's go. Go!
- Let's go.

544
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:08,730
I will brief you about today's work.

545
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:14,078
- Ouch!
- Be careful.

546
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:16,922
Guys, be careful of your heads.

547
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,690
Is this the place?

548
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:22,828
We are going to pick up the trash.

549
00:37:22,828 --> 00:37:25,898
Let's pick it up and gather it in one place.

550
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:27,249
I will do my best.

551
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,435
Sounds great, Hyung! Shall we start?

552
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:32,421
Let's pump up the spirit.

553
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:34,356
Let's move this chair.

554
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:37,584
Let's do this!

555
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:41,374
Next, please take this.

556
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:48,644
There are so many mosquitoes.

557
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,606
- Hyung.
- Yes?

558
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:52,942
- Do you want some of mine?
- What?

559
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:55,986
I ate a lot for breakfast, so I'm not very hungry now.

560
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:58,271
Really? Then thank you.

561
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:05,763
Thanks.

562
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,490
<i>What is his problem?</i>

563
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,960
<i>Did he just give his favorite food to Hyung Jin Wook?</i>

564
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:18,275
You eat that!

565
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:19,760
I don't like vegetables.

566
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,220
I want the meat dish.

567
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,747
Why are there so many mosquitoes?

568
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,350
The quail eggs look very good.

569
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,030
What a mountain of trash!

570
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:32,981
There's so much to work on.

571
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,384
There's so much trash to pick up.

572
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:38,404
I will carry the heavier ones.

573
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:40,631
When will we ever finish?

574
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,929
Jay, I want to talk to you about something.

575
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,222
Hyung!

576
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:51,075
This looks heavy. I think we need to carry it together.

577
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,835
Okay.

578
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:54,144
Sorry, excuse me.

579
00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:55,944
- Can you take this one?
- Aigoo.

580
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,033
One, two, three!

581
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:06,806
What the—... Since when did those two become so close?

582
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:15,623
Snake! Snake! Snake! Shit!

583
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:21,754
This is just a rubber hose!

584
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,827
Hold my hand.

585
00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:34,008
Aigoo.

586
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:47,714
It's hot! Hot!

587
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:49,764
Careful.

588
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,414
Wow!

589
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,734
- How is it? Is it fine?
- It's good.

590
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:58,592
Thank you for your hard work today.

591
00:39:58,592 --> 00:40:01,152
No problem. It was so much fun.

592
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:07,871
Hyung Jin Wook, why aren't you drinking?

593
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:10,941
Oh, because I don't want to lose my muscle mass.

594
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,905
I feel the same.

595
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,334
Jay, are you okay after that fall earlier?

596
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:17,402
Yes, I'm okay.

597
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,439
Did you wash yourself off properly?

598
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,116
I'm not sure.

599
00:40:22,116 --> 00:40:24,435
Things are still stuck on you.

600
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:25,828
Aigoo.

601
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:27,910
<i>Is it because I drank too much?</i>

602
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,260
<i>Why am I feeling like this?</i>

603
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:35,261
I will go and get ready to sleep.

604
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,676
Let's clean up together in the morning.

605
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:51,763
I will just clean up and go to bed.

606
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,689
- Then I'll go to bed first, okay?
- Yes, go ahead.

607
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,451
Hey!

608
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:29,145
Where are you going?

609
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:31,263
Nothing. I was just...

610
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:34,248
Do you like him that much that you sneak after him?

611
00:41:34,248 --> 00:41:36,143
What are you talking about?

612
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:38,187
Speaking to him every day isn't enough.

613
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:40,022
You even follow him to volunteer work.

614
00:41:40,022 --> 00:41:43,441
Do you really just like him as an older brother?

615
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:48,447
Hey! Don't be silent.

616
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:50,366
I asked if you like him or not?

617
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:51,975
I do have feelings.

618
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,487
What?

619
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,842
I do have feelings.

620
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:04,287
So it is true.

621
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:06,948
Jay...

622
00:42:06,948 --> 00:42:08,683
I have feelings for you.

623
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:50,207
Hyung, what are you doing here?

624
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:52,130
Oh!

625
00:42:52,684 --> 00:42:56,529
I couldn't finish organizing this morning. I was doing the rest.

626
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:59,157
I will help.

627
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:03,694
Okay. Why are you awake at this hour, though?

628
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:07,123
I just couldn't get to sleep.

629
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:08,891
Is that so?

630
00:43:25,496 --> 00:43:27,289
<i>I do have feelings.</i>

631
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:28,832
<i>Jay, I have feelings for you.</i>

632
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:30,009
<i>Did I hear that right?</i>

633
00:43:30,009 --> 00:43:32,635
<i>I didn't hear it incorrectly, did I?</i>

634
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:41,558
<i>Let's calm down.</i>

635
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:46,476
<i>But... why is it me and not Hyung Jin Wook?</i>

636
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:29,675
Jay, did you sleep well?

637
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:31,009
Yes, I did.

638
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:33,198
Let's pack up and leave.

639
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:37,399
Guys, wake up! Wake up.

640
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,986
Hey, was the ramyeon I made yesterday tasty?

641
00:44:44,986 --> 00:44:47,572
I liked Oppa's* ramyeon more.
<i>("older brother," used by Korean females)</i>

642
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:50,415
- Let's come here again next time.
- Yes, that sounds great!

643
00:44:50,415 --> 00:44:53,454
We are heading home after volunteer work.

644
00:44:53,454 --> 00:44:55,556
I'm sure everyone is quite exhausted.

645
00:44:55,556 --> 00:44:59,435
I want to get home early, skip any distractions, wash up, and go to bed.

646
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:01,380
Guys, say goodbye.

647
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,981
<i>Bye!</i>

648
00:45:14,286 --> 00:45:16,196
<i>[You two look so good together! More videos of you two, please!]</i>

649
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:18,386
<i>[Two handsome boys together, so cute!]</i>

650
00:45:18,386 --> 00:45:20,286
<i>[I hope you two film the next video!]</i>

651
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:21,314
Okay!

652
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:24,986
I have an idea for my next video.
<i>[Group Activity Assignment Plan: Create a Healthy Meal Plan]</i>

653
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:30,424
This week's group activity assignment is to pair up, and film a cooking video.

654
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:32,510
- Should we decide the pairs?
- Me, me!

655
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,262
Let's film the video together, you and me.

656
00:45:35,262 --> 00:45:36,805
I was just...

657
00:45:36,805 --> 00:45:40,516
That's great! Ki Hyeon, let's do it together.

658
00:45:41,846 --> 00:45:43,687
I don't mind either way.

659
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:44,922
That's great.

660
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:46,757
Let's schedule a time in our next class.

661
00:45:46,757 --> 00:45:49,484
How about a healthy menu that's good for bodybuilding?

662
00:45:49,484 --> 00:45:52,429
Let's list our menus next week to avoid overlaps.

663
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:55,133
Sounds good! Have you ever made any healthy meals?

664
00:45:55,133 --> 00:45:59,286
No, my mom cooks everything for me.

665
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:03,039
What will be a good menu idea?

666
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,253
Oh, I should ask Hyung Jin Wook about it!

667
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:09,171
Oh, that sounds good.

668
00:46:09,171 --> 00:46:10,723
Ask him and let me know.

669
00:46:10,723 --> 00:46:12,232
I will.

670
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:18,373
Hyung Jin Wook, do you have any suggestions for a healthy recipe?

671
00:46:18,373 --> 00:46:21,057
There are many.

672
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:23,794
There are so many healthy recipes of chicken breast.

673
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:25,826
I have some photos. Do you want to see?

674
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,336
Yes, please.

675
00:46:30,816 --> 00:46:32,520
There are so many!

676
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:37,517
So many! I've never thought about healthy recipes, but there are so many!

677
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:41,016
You two seem to be having fun.

678
00:46:41,016 --> 00:46:43,016
It's making me curious.

679
00:46:43,016 --> 00:46:46,917
I was showing Jay some healthy meals that I've made.

680
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:48,790
Do you want to see them too?

681
00:46:51,196 --> 00:46:54,392
<i>I do have feelings. Jay, I have feelings for you.</i>

682
00:46:54,392 --> 00:46:57,344
<i>Why does that moment keep popping into my head?</i>

683
00:46:57,344 --> 00:46:59,931
<i>It's driving me crazy.</i>

684
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:01,973
You're finally here?

685
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:04,475
Go and do your thing. I have some things to do.

686
00:47:05,636 --> 00:47:07,105
Okay.

687
00:47:09,516 --> 00:47:13,319
I will get all the ingredients. You just tidy the room a bit.

688
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:16,613
I will upload this cooking video on my YouTube channel as well,

689
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:19,477
so don't forget to dress nicely.

690
00:47:20,756 --> 00:47:23,179
I will just film it very naturally.

691
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,064
I won't make you say any lines, so don't worry.

692
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:26,624
All right.

693
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:29,754
I've sent you the recipe, so take a look.

694
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:31,885
- See you later.
- Okay.

695
00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:34,006
See you later.

696
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:36,016
Wait for me!

697
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:40,079
I need to shop for ingredients. Let's go to the gym tomorrow.

698
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,204
Yes, fine.

699
00:47:57,186 --> 00:47:59,031
- Ji Won.
- Yes, Oppa?

700
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:02,309
Come over as soon your work is done, okay?

701
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:04,979
Okay, Oppa. By the way, you look really excited.

702
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,939
You know, I'm a good cook.

703
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:09,373
- I'm heading out.
- Okay. See you later!

704
00:48:24,514 --> 00:48:28,059
Today, we will make konjac noodles*.
<i>(*noodles made from the konjac yam)</i>

705
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:30,878
And here is my handsome partner.

706
00:48:32,906 --> 00:48:37,068
Okay, tonight's main event is cooking. Let's see the ingredients first.

707
00:48:37,068 --> 00:48:40,640
As you can see, there are noodles, clams, and chives.

708
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,149
I will start by chopping the chives.

709
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:50,608
If you're so worried, why don't you call first?

710
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:52,527
Is it a lovers' quarrel?

711
00:48:54,146 --> 00:48:59,406
No. I'm just worried about Jay and if he can even hold a knife properly.

712
00:49:01,046 --> 00:49:02,594
Don't worry about him.

713
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:04,454
An expert is there to help him.

714
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:06,306
- "An expert"?
- Yes.

715
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:07,599
Who is the expert?

716
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,335
The only expert cook around us is Hyung Jin Wook, of course.

717
00:49:10,335 --> 00:49:14,056
- He makes a great low-sodium chicken breast steak–
- What?

718
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:15,607
A great low-sodium chicken breast steak...

719
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:17,151
No, not that part.

720
00:49:17,151 --> 00:49:19,861
Is Hyung Jin Wook with them right now?

721
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:22,405
What's wrong? I'm not lacking in skills.

722
00:49:22,405 --> 00:49:24,366
- Where is it?
- What?

723
00:49:24,366 --> 00:49:27,184
Where are they cooking right now?

724
00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:31,206
Where was it?

725
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:33,150
Jay!

726
00:49:35,536 --> 00:49:37,836
Jay!

727
00:49:37,836 --> 00:49:40,233
Yes? What is it?

728
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:42,634
What's going on?

729
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:44,352
Why are you guys here?

730
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:50,266
I thought about it...

731
00:49:50,266 --> 00:49:54,062
And I thought we should film in a proper place like this, too.

732
00:49:54,062 --> 00:49:57,815
Wow. This cup is so clean!

733
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,990
The losers at rock-paper-scissors do the dishes!

734
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,670
- Let's pick two people.
- Okay.

735
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:19,000
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissors!

736
00:50:32,986 --> 00:50:36,377
Oh, it's here! Found it.

737
00:50:36,377 --> 00:50:39,967
Wait, isn't this Seung Joo's camera?

738
00:50:40,676 --> 00:50:43,304
It is. I guess he forgot it.

739
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:45,897
Should I call him?

740
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:49,108
It's okay. He will come to the gym tomorrow. I will hand it to him then.

741
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:51,266
Okay then.

742
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:53,029
All right. Good luck with the dishes.

743
00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:55,131
See you later. Thank you!

744
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:56,683
- See you, Jay.
- Bye.

745
00:50:56,683 --> 00:50:58,228
See you.

746
00:51:11,174 --> 00:51:12,776
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

747
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:16,446
Don't forget to check what I asked you to earlier.

748
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:21,368
Yes, the company will come and let us know. Don't worry about it.

749
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:24,262
By the way, are you going out?

750
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:29,901
Yes, I don't think I can return today. Please close the gym yourself.

751
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,452
Okay.

752
00:51:44,532 --> 00:51:47,258
<i>I can't live without you, Hyung.</i>

753
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:50,939
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

754
00:51:50,939 --> 00:51:53,058
<i>You're drunk. I'm going inside first.</i>

755
00:51:53,058 --> 00:51:54,317
<i>Please sober up a bit before coming in.</i>

756
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:56,069
<i>I'm not drunk, Hyung!</i>

757
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:58,245
<i>I'm serious right now.</i>

758
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,360
What are you watching?

759
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,040
Oh! Ji Won, thank you.

760
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,710
It shocked me to think that I had lost my camera.

761
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,921
I was watching to see if your recording came out well.

762
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:17,183
It's okay. There's nothing much in it.

763
00:52:17,183 --> 00:52:19,701
<i>Hey, my mom said...</i>

764
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:22,287
As expected from Choi Sung Hoon!

765
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:24,231
He looks so good onscreen.

766
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:29,460
Right? Jay also has good proportions, thanks to his small face.

767
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:34,483
Hey, I should get going.

768
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,126
I will buy you a nice meal next time.

769
00:52:36,126 --> 00:52:37,318
All right.

770
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:39,327
- Bye!
- See you.

771
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:48,688
I shouldn't pry into other people's business.

772
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,056
<i>I can't live without you, Hyung.</i>

773
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:08,074
Oh, that video was in here.

774
00:53:08,074 --> 00:53:10,076
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

775
00:53:10,076 --> 00:53:14,401
<i>You're drunk. I'm going inside first. Please sober up a bit before coming in.</i>

776
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:21,800
That's refreshing!

777
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,373
I didn't know you were good at drinking!

778
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,977
Well, Ji Won...

779
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,611
Have you ever experienced something like this?

780
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,379
Like what?

781
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:41,691
Even though you and someone are far apart, you keep thinking about the person.

782
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:44,987
And if that person is popular with others,

783
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:47,614
you get annoyed and strangely irritated.

784
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:54,295
But if you run into that person, you somehow run away.

785
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:56,490
You have a crush.

786
00:53:57,075 --> 00:53:59,244
Even if you run away?

787
00:53:59,244 --> 00:54:00,745
Think about it.

788
00:54:00,745 --> 00:54:04,189
When you are with that person, does your heart pound?

789
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:07,528
Well... it seems to be like that.

790
00:54:07,528 --> 00:54:11,172
You feel irritated and annoyed for no reason,

791
00:54:11,172 --> 00:54:14,441
but you become uncomfortable if you don't see that person.

792
00:54:16,344 --> 00:54:18,763
That's a crush!

793
00:54:18,763 --> 00:54:22,874
Why? Do you have someone on your mind lately?

794
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:29,316
Why are you drinking your beer as if it's water?

795
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:31,442
You will likely get drunk.

796
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:33,677
Beer doesn't make me drunk.

797
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:40,452
Choi Sung Hoon! Hey, you!

798
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:46,255
Come out... Come out now!

799
00:54:50,378 --> 00:54:51,779
Jay?

800
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:54,115
Here you are, Sung Hoon.

801
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:56,802
I missed you!

802
00:54:56,802 --> 00:54:59,494
Wait. Have a seat first.

803
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,643
What happened? Why are you so drunk?

804
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:12,899
I came here because I missed you. I'm the best, right?

805
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:18,670
That's good, but... Why did you drink so much?

806
00:55:19,715 --> 00:55:24,371
Do you know how much I struggled all day because of you?

807
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:26,581
Hey! That's my line.

808
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:29,959
Where were you? I haven't seen you all afternoon.

809
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:32,836
I ran away from you.

810
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,456
I tried my best to run away from you.

811
00:55:35,456 --> 00:55:38,825
But wherever I went, you were there.

812
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:45,575
I said we should take some time apart.

813
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:49,479
I'm the one who said it's overwhelming,

814
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:56,025
but I guess I feel the opposite.

815
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,352
Or is my heart

816
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:07,640
saying that I like you?

817

820
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:13,750
You surprised me!

821
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:16,879
Your posture is slouched.

822
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:19,122
I think it's better to push the seat back.

823
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:25,988
Is it fine?

824
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:27,072
It's good.

825
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:31,830
If you feel unwell from drinking heavily last night, rest today.

826
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:34,746
Right, yesterday...

827
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:43,046
Are you really okay?

828
00:57:44,592 --> 00:57:47,359
Of course, I'm really fine.

829
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,828
Are you feverish?

830
00:57:48,828 --> 00:57:50,745
I'm telling the truth.

831
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:58,270
Don't push yourself, and let me know if it's too hard.

832
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,413
Thank you.

833
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:01,148
Also...

834
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:03,675
Let's do our assignment together after this.

835
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,320
Okay.

836
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,629
I will work out over there.

837
00:58:07,629 --> 00:58:09,113
All right.

838
00:58:10,933 --> 00:58:13,860
<i>It's good to spend time together.</i>

839
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:21,040
It's nice out here.

843
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,642
After finishing the assignment, the whole day has passed.

844
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:39,103
But it ended quickly since we did it together.

845
00:58:39,103 --> 00:58:42,947
I wasn't feeling well so you did almost everything for me.

846
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:50,322
After spending the whole day together, I still feel it is insufficient now that we are going home.

847
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:52,741
But we will see each other tomorrow at college.

848
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:55,593
I know, but...

849
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:01,824
It's getting late. Go inside.

850
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:10,701
All right. Get home safe.

851
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:12,636
Don't make me worried.

852
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,220
Okay?

853
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,912
Oh, also...

854
00:59:21,912 --> 00:59:24,697
Do you want to go on a date after class tomorrow?

855
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,630
Right now...

856
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:38,233
it seems that people feel the same as last year.

857
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:39,635
"Last year"?

858
00:59:39,635 --> 00:59:43,797
Last year, people stared at me a lot,

859
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:46,724
since you and I were always together.

860
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:51,170
And because we are like this now, I'm getting that feeling again.

861
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,115
Now that I think about it, you're right.

862
00:59:56,017 --> 00:59:57,802
But...

863
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,672
It's okay for me.

864
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:04,593
But if the atmosphere isn't good, we might get swept up in it.

865
01:00:04,593 --> 01:00:08,762
I think it would be better to just stay home and not go out.

866
01:00:08,762 --> 01:00:10,891
Aren't you coming with me?

867
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:14,227
I have to go somewhere, but I will be right back.

868
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:15,871
Let me come with you!

869
01:00:15,871 --> 01:00:17,047
No.

870
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:20,800
I will come by your place immediately after.

871
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:24,120
Okay, take care of yourself.

872
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,939
See you later.

873
01:00:31,353 --> 01:00:34,130
Does he have to go to that thing today?

874
01:00:49,434 --> 01:00:51,177
What's going on?

875
01:00:51,978 --> 01:00:53,463
I saw it.

876
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:55,565
I saw Oppa Jin Wook with Jun Sik.

877
01:00:55,565 --> 01:00:57,191
Where?

878
01:00:57,942 --> 01:01:00,077
I saw it on Seung Joo's camera.

879
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:03,615
That's great information.

880
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,575
My hunch was right.

881
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:08,211
Let's ask Seung Joo for the footage.

882
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:14,876
Since he doesn't know that I saw that video, asking for it is a bit of a problem.

883
01:01:14,876 --> 01:01:16,251
Is that so?

884
01:01:16,953 --> 01:01:21,323
Then I will casually ask him at our next group assignment.

885
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:28,139
But do you really think Oppa Jin Wook is the culprit?

886
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:29,974
Yes.

887
01:01:29,974 --> 01:01:32,568
There are too many suspicious circumstances.

888
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:39,301
No wonder. His behavior has been strange lately.

889
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:42,511
But still, could it really be him?

890
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:45,555
I'm working hard today as well, picking up litter.

891
01:01:45,555 --> 01:01:47,440
It's quite cool.

892
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,674
Another piece of trash goes in the bin.

893
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:52,978
Hi, excuse me.

894
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,574
Thank you for the drinks.

895
01:01:56,574 --> 01:01:58,117
I love your YouTube channel.

896
01:01:58,117 --> 01:02:00,436
I don't believe those rumors.

897
01:02:00,436 --> 01:02:04,424
Also, could you give one of these to Oppa Sung Hoon?

898
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:08,227
Of course. I will hand it to him.

899
01:02:08,227 --> 01:02:10,779
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

900
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:26,551
- Seung Joo!
- Yes?

901
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:29,095
I'm just wondering...

902
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:33,640
Do you have any videos of the day we went to volunteer?

903
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,294
You know, the day that incident happened.

904
01:02:38,294 --> 01:02:39,614
Why do you ask?

905
01:02:39,614 --> 01:02:42,900
I just missed Jun Sik.

906
01:02:43,701 --> 01:02:46,354
No, I have no videos of that day.

907
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,884
What did he say?

908
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:03,311
Did you perhaps see it wrongly?

909
01:03:03,311 --> 01:03:05,891
I'm sure I didn't.

910
01:03:05,891 --> 01:03:07,518
What the heck?

911
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:12,213
No, I really saw it! I saw Oppa Jin Wook push Jun Sik down.

912
01:03:34,221 --> 01:03:35,645
Oh?

913
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,980
♫ <i>Because I'm toxic, stay away from me, or else you might get hurt...</i> ♫

914
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:43,603
Let's install it.

915
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:46,114
Install what?

916
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:49,207
A location-tracking app.

917
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:51,453
Do you have to go to the extent of using a location-tracking app?

918
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:55,441
It's good to share each other's locations and statuses.

919
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,734
Who knows who might fall into danger?

920
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,460
Sung Hoon...

921
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,100
What do you think?

922
01:04:02,331 --> 01:04:03,823
Yes.

923
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,201
I like the idea.

924
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:09,306
I could see all of your locations.

925
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:16,420
But why do you think Seung Joo said there's no video?

926
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,622
She didn't see it incorrectly, right?

927
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,897
I don't think Ji Won would have made that up.

928
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:24,680
By the way, why is she not coming?

929
01:04:25,285 --> 01:04:27,180
Let me call her.

930
01:04:33,627 --> 01:04:38,637
<i>[Call me when you see this.]
[To Ji Won]</i>

931
01:04:39,457 --> 01:04:41,778
She's not answering so I left a message.

932
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:45,866
Hey, don't you think we might get a "Brave Citizen Award"

933
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:48,827
or a "Detective Award" later?

934
01:04:48,827 --> 01:04:53,790
"Students caught the killer based on a citizen's report..."
We could get on the news!

935
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,727
Wow... Daebak.

936
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,987
What a great dream. Do you think it's possible?

937
01:04:58,987 --> 01:05:00,497
Sung Hoon is right.

938
01:05:01,457 --> 01:05:03,807
Oh, that's right! I have an errand to do.

939
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:05,337
Okay.

940
01:05:06,547 --> 01:05:10,277
Hey, I will install an app and share it with you guys!

941
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,458
- Bye.
- See you.

942
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,860
I'm so stressed lately.

943
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,300
Since we stopped going to the gym due to the situation, my body feels stiff.

944
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:24,997
Do you want me to massage you?

945
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:28,085
It feels nice.

946
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:33,665
Since we are home together, we exercise together, and I get a massage.

947
01:05:33,665 --> 01:05:38,034
We do homework together and eat together.

948
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,172
I feel like this is my home.

949
01:05:40,172 --> 01:05:42,391
Then why don't you live here?

950
01:05:42,391 --> 01:05:45,842
- Can I do that?
- Of course.

951
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:48,329
No. I was just saying it.

952
01:05:49,214 --> 01:05:53,284
<i>Although these happy little moments are temporary now, in the end,</i>

953
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:56,104
<i>if this happiness continues, that would be good.</i>

954
01:05:56,104 --> 01:05:58,199
- It hurts. It hurts. Ouch!
- No, it will feel refreshing.

955
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:00,784
Ouch. Ouch! It hurts there. Don't use your elbows! Don't use them!

956
01:06:00,784 --> 01:06:03,294
No, no, it won't be that painful.

957
01:06:32,644 --> 01:06:34,394
<i>[Ji Won: Call me when you see this.]</i>

958
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:43,893
Ji Won?

959
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:49,015
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

960
01:06:49,015 --> 01:06:50,900
Thank you.

961
01:07:00,066 --> 01:07:02,276
I'm not the murderer.

962
01:07:02,276 --> 01:07:03,786
What?

963
01:07:05,196 --> 01:07:07,198
I'm saying that I'm not the murderer.

964
01:07:07,198 --> 01:07:11,269
I don't know why you guys suspect me.

965
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:14,856
- But you've got it wrong.
- That bloody hand plow in the gym's storage room.

966
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:17,115
How do you explain that?

967
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:20,111
Prove it.

968
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:22,629
That you weren't at the site of the incident.

969
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:27,742
Sure. Fine.

970
01:07:34,792 --> 01:07:36,853
It was this day.

971
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:41,274
After the volunteer work, I came straight to the gym to exercise.

972
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:46,059
After an hour or so, I got a message from Jun Sik.

973
01:07:47,572 --> 01:07:52,368
He had something to tell me one last time and wanted to meet right away.

974
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,211
<i>Jun Sik.</i>

975
01:08:02,987 --> 01:08:04,780
<i>J-Jun Sik...</i>

976
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:08,976
<i>Hey, Jun Sik!</i>

977
01:08:10,495 --> 01:08:14,490
<i>Hey, Jun Sik... Jun Sik!</i>

978
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:19,230
<i>Come to your senses, Jun Sik!</i>

979
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:20,722
<i>No... Jun Sik...</i>

980
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,983
<i>Please wake up, Jun Sik!</i>

981
01:08:23,983 --> 01:08:27,895
<i>Is there anyone there? Help!</i>

982
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,872
<i>Jun Sik, please...</i>

983
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:22,850
<i>One day, someone put the bloody hand plow in the storage room.</i>

984
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:25,670
<i>I had definitely washed it and thrown it away.</i>

985
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,039
<i>I got scared so I wrapped it in newspapers and hid it.</i>

986
01:09:32,606 --> 01:09:35,734
The culprit... is threatening me.

987
01:09:35,734 --> 01:09:38,821
He wants the rumor to spread and frame me as the murderer.

988
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:40,581
Then the real murderer is–

989
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:44,284
Someone around us who knows us well.

990
01:09:44,284 --> 01:09:47,412
And that might be Seung Joo.

991
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:56,130
The midterms are just around the corner.

992
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,423
It's nice weather today.

993
01:09:57,423 --> 01:09:59,065
Seung Joo.

994
01:10:04,558 --> 01:10:08,995
We are going to check Hyung Jin Wook's alibi today.

995
01:10:08,995 --> 01:10:10,729
You should come with us.

996
01:10:11,998 --> 01:10:14,250
All right then.

997
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,051
See you guys later.

998
01:10:18,229 --> 01:10:20,989
There's a new event this evening.

999
01:10:28,379 --> 01:10:30,348
Did you tell Hyung Jin Wook about the plan?

1000
01:10:30,348 --> 01:10:34,176
I did everything as planned, but will he really take the bait?

1001
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:35,970
Act normally when Seung Joo comes.

1002
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:40,366
If he's really the murderer, as Hyung suspects, he will take the bait.

1003
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:43,669
Isn't this too dangerous? And what if Seung Joo also isn't the culprit?

1004
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:46,881
Don't worry. No matter who the culprit is, I'll protect you.

1005
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:50,715
Guys... he's coming.

1006
01:10:51,485 --> 01:10:54,112
We need to execute this perfectly.

1007
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:58,107
- You're here!
- Yes.

1008
01:11:01,604 --> 01:11:03,464
Sorry, I'm late.

1009
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:17,320
We are looking pretty neutral right now.

1010
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,290
Are you okay?

1011
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:30,730
I didn't drink water when I ate the chicken breast earlier. My throat is sore.

1012
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:43,920
If Hyung Jin Wook comes out before you return, we will follow him, so keep in touch.

1013
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:56,391
Guys, sorry. I need the bathroom.

1014
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:28,975
<i>Wouldn't this be too sweet?</i>

1015
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:31,353
<i>But would this be too bland?</i>

1016
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:38,308
<i>Well, I'll give you everything you want.</i>

1017
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:47,921
Sung Hoon!

1018
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,052
He must have followed you.

1019
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,608
Ki Hyeon will catch up to us, won't he?

1020
01:13:01,608 --> 01:13:02,817
It will be all right.

1021
01:13:02,817 --> 01:13:06,550
He would have followed him, so we would know when Ki Hyeon shows up.

1022
01:13:08,936 --> 01:13:11,267
I hope what you said is true.

1023
01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:13,789
If not, it won't be good for you either.

1024
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:28,455
Did you see the culprit?

1025
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:34,896
If I hadn't gone to the bathroom, I could have recorded it all.

1026
01:13:34,896 --> 01:13:37,120
What a shame!

1027
01:13:37,732 --> 01:13:39,950
I also needed the bathroom.

1028
01:13:43,946 --> 01:13:45,698
This can't be true.

1029
01:13:45,698 --> 01:13:49,827
No matter how much I think about it, it must be Seung Joo.

1030
01:13:49,827 --> 01:13:51,771
Where did it go wrong?

1031
01:13:51,771 --> 01:13:56,451
Since Ki Hyeon will follow Seung Joo, let's see how it goes.

1032
01:13:56,451 --> 01:14:01,688
If it's neither you nor Seung Joo, the culprit might not be among us.

1033
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,951
Let's keep our eyes on him.

1034
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:07,594
The culprit will definitely return here.

1035
01:14:08,913 --> 01:14:11,056
Do you think Ji Won is okay?

1036
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:14,744
Tomorrow, let's consider our next step.

1037
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:17,554
Ki Hyeon would have gotten home safe, right?

1038
01:14:22,652 --> 01:14:24,570
Yes, Mom.

1039
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,338
I'm on my way home.

1040
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:28,784
I bought what you asked for.

1041
01:14:28,784 --> 01:14:31,718
Yes, I'll be home soon.

1042
01:14:47,436 --> 01:14:49,166
One second, please.

1043
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:50,513
What is it? Is something wrong?

1044
01:14:50,513 --> 01:14:52,364
It's an emergency. Ki Hyeon...

1045
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:53,933
He hasn't answered his phone.

1046
01:14:53,933 --> 01:14:56,819
Wait. Didn't you guys say you have a location-tracking app?

1047
01:14:56,819 --> 01:14:59,654
The problem is that his phone is off and I can't contact him at all.

1048
01:15:00,773 --> 01:15:03,900
For now, let's go out and search for him.

1049
01:15:05,736 --> 01:15:07,604
Sir?

1050
01:15:36,809 --> 01:15:39,276
He's nowhere on campus.

1051
01:15:39,979 --> 01:15:41,564
He wasn't at his home either.

1052
01:15:41,564 --> 01:15:43,732
Where did he go?

1053
01:15:45,818 --> 01:15:49,129
Wait, his location just appeared!

1054
01:15:50,348 --> 01:15:54,476
Hey! This is where we did our volunteer work.

1055
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,727
Ki Hyeon...

1056
01:16:31,732 --> 01:16:33,616
K-Ki Hyeon!

1057
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:40,057
Hey, Ki Hyeon!

1058
01:16:40,057 --> 01:16:42,643
Hey, Ki Hyeon. Wake up!

1059
01:16:42,643 --> 01:16:44,645
- Hey!
- Wake up!

1060
01:16:44,645 --> 01:16:45,963
Are you okay?

1061
01:16:45,963 --> 01:16:48,081
- Ki Hyeon!
- Are you okay?

1062
01:16:49,867 --> 01:16:51,568
Ki Hyeon!

1063
01:16:54,763 --> 01:16:55,789
Are you okay?

1064
01:16:55,789 --> 01:16:57,558
Inside...

1065
01:16:57,558 --> 01:16:59,651
Ji Won is inside...

1066
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:03,069
Ji Won is in there... O-Oh, my head!

1067
01:17:03,069 --> 01:17:04,665
Don't strain yourself.

1068
01:17:04,665 --> 01:17:06,375
Why don't you guys go inside?

1069
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,460
- I'll stay here with Ki Hyeon.
- Okay, Hyung.

1070
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,094
Jay, let's go.

1071
01:17:10,871 --> 01:17:13,764
Are you okay?

1072
01:17:15,451 --> 01:17:17,360
Sung Hoon.

1073
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,700
We will all be safe, wont we?

1074
01:17:23,267 --> 01:17:24,526
I-I'm scared.

1075
01:17:24,526 --> 01:17:26,461
Don't worry.

1076
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,372
Let's go.

1077
01:17:52,296 --> 01:17:54,847
- Ji Won!
- Ji Won!

1078
01:17:56,425 --> 01:17:57,743
Are you okay?

1079
01:17:57,743 --> 01:17:59,160
Ji Won!

1080
01:18:04,017 --> 01:18:09,645
I feel like rubbish after squatting in that cramped space for so long.

1081
01:18:12,608 --> 01:18:14,367
It was you.

1082
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:18,030
You are the one who killed Jun Sik and kidnapped Ji Won, right?

1083
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,206
So what?

1084
01:18:21,025 --> 01:18:24,403
Seung Joo, this is the end for you.

1085
01:18:24,403 --> 01:18:26,822
You can't do anything by yourself.

1086
01:18:26,822 --> 01:18:28,473
What's wrong?

1087
01:18:29,783 --> 01:18:31,826
Watch your back!

1088
01:18:37,741 --> 01:18:40,376
Who said he was alone?

1089
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:54,064
Are you awake now?

1090
01:18:55,103 --> 01:18:57,207
So...

1091
01:18:57,207 --> 01:18:59,636
Why did you complicate things?

1092
01:18:59,636 --> 01:19:01,253
Why are you doing all this?

1093
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:02,429
Why else?

1094
01:19:02,429 --> 01:19:05,733
This is the easiest and cleanest way for everyone.

1095
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:07,823
- What?
- On the day it occurred,

1096
01:19:07,823 --> 01:19:11,413
Jun Sik was still alive when you saw him.

1097
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:16,543
<i>Okay, that's good. Let's do three sets of ten each.</i>

1098
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,579
<i>- Ten each.
- Yes, like hugging a ball.</i>

1099
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:19,988
- "Like hugging a ball."
- That's right.

1100
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:21,798
<i>- Hyung Jin Wook!
- Yes?</i>

1101
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:23,999
<i>Am I doing it right?</i>

1102
01:19:24,713 --> 01:19:26,928
<i>Yes, you're doing great, Seung Joo!</i>

1103
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,604
<i>Okay!</i>

1104
01:19:29,763 --> 01:19:31,457
<i>Do you see this?</i>

1105
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,108
We were perfect.

1106
01:19:40,827 --> 01:19:45,043
We were happy with each other and not crossing any lines until that day.

1107
01:19:52,559 --> 01:19:54,420
<i>Are you a nature YouTuber?</i>

1108
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,339
<i>Why do you film a vlog on a mountain?</i>

1109
01:19:56,339 --> 01:19:58,273
<i>We have arrived.</i>

1110
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:07,766
<i>I have feelings for you, Hyung.</i>

1111
01:20:09,809 --> 01:20:13,356
<i>Since I first joined the club,</i>

1112
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:15,233
<i>I've had a crush on you.</i>

1113
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,678
<i>We are in the same club.</i>

1114
01:20:18,678 --> 01:20:21,781
<i>Please rethink it.</i>

1115
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:23,824
<i>No.</i>

1116
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:26,585
<i>I can't live without you, Hyung.</i>

1117
01:20:28,259 --> 01:20:30,248
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

1118
01:20:30,248 --> 01:20:32,466
<i>You're too drunk.</i>

1119
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,795
<i>I'm going inside first. Please sober up a bit.</i>

1120
01:20:35,795 --> 01:20:38,464
<i>I'm not drunk, Hyung!</i>

1121
01:20:38,464 --> 01:20:40,758
<i>I'm serious right now.</i>

1122
01:20:44,779 --> 01:20:46,873
<i>- Hyung!
- He's drunk. What will you do?</i>

1123
01:20:46,873 --> 01:20:48,349
<i>Hyung!</i>

1124
01:20:48,349 --> 01:20:50,701
<i>I want to comfort him.</i>

1125
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:55,882
<i>It's up to you.</i>

1126
01:20:55,882 --> 01:20:57,858
<i>Hyung!</i>

1127
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:04,239
<i>Jun Sik, are you okay?</i>

1128
01:21:08,536 --> 01:21:11,369
<i>Just pretend you didn't see that.</i>

1129
01:21:11,369 --> 01:21:14,865
<i>Jun Sik. Jun Sik!</i>

1130
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:20,172
<i>Jun Sik.</i>

1131
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,890
<i>I know it sounds selfish,</i>

1132
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:32,375
<i>but may I have feelings for you?</i>

1133
01:21:41,444 --> 01:21:43,695
<i>I've been noticing you for a long time.</i>

1134
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:47,033
<i>I was hiding my feelings.</i>

1135
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:49,802
<i>But after looking at you struggling, I can't help it anymore.</i>

1136
01:21:49,802 --> 01:21:51,694
<i>You won't do.</i>

1137
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:53,472
<i>Why not?</i>

1138
01:21:53,472 --> 01:21:56,491
<i>You're not Hyung Jin Wook.</i>

1139
01:21:58,419 --> 01:21:59,978
<i>Jun Sik...</i>

1140
01:22:03,449 --> 01:22:05,792
<i>Please go now.</i>

1141
01:22:06,636 --> 01:22:09,038
<i>Can't I have feelings for you?</i>

1142
01:22:10,856 --> 01:22:14,576
<i>You're too excessive.</i>

1143
01:22:15,453 --> 01:22:17,813
<i>Sometimes, you scare me.</i>

1144
01:22:22,293 --> 01:22:25,612
<i>I'm saying this since I'm a bit tipsy.</i>

1145
01:22:26,547 --> 01:22:28,724
<i>You give me the creeps.</i>

1146
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,513
<i>Stop watching me in secret.</i>

1147
01:22:41,053 --> 01:22:42,547
<i>Can't I even look at you?</i>

1148
01:22:42,547 --> 01:22:44,090
<i>Let me go.</i>

1149
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:46,584
<i>I haven't done anything. I've just watched you from a distance.</i>

1150
01:22:46,584 --> 01:22:48,177
<i>I said let me go!</i>

1151
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:50,646
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

1152
01:23:11,396 --> 01:23:15,288
<i>Jun Sik, how far are you going?</i>

1153
01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:16,731
<i>Let's talk.</i>

1154
01:23:16,731 --> 01:23:19,625
<i>Go away. Don't come any closer.</i>

1155
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,977
<i>I told you not to come any closer.</i>

1156
01:23:24,814 --> 01:23:26,924
<i>Hit me. But you're too much of a coward to hit me.</i>

1157
01:23:26,924 --> 01:23:29,010
<i>Seriously... Get away from me!</i>

1158
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:30,078
<i>Get away from me.</i>

1159
01:23:30,078 --> 01:23:31,637
<i>Go away!</i>

1160
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:33,556
<i>I said, get lost!</i>

1161
01:23:35,925 --> 01:23:37,769
<i>Let go.</i>

1162
01:23:37,769 --> 01:23:39,187
<i>Let go of me!</i>

1163
01:23:39,187 --> 01:23:41,164
<i>I said to let me go!</i>

1164
01:23:41,164 --> 01:23:42,656
<i>Let go!</i>

1165
01:23:52,896 --> 01:23:55,178
<i>Hey... hey!</i>

1166
01:23:57,046 --> 01:23:58,486
<i>Jun Sik.</i>

1167
01:23:59,146 --> 01:24:00,546
<i>Hey!</i>

1168
01:24:38,746 --> 01:24:41,040
<i>Help me...</i>

1169
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,266
<i>Seung Joo stabbed me.</i>

1170
01:24:44,266 --> 01:24:46,696
<i>Oh, well...</i>

1171
01:24:48,022 --> 01:24:50,115
<i>This is becoming troublesome.</i>

1172
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:31,556
<i>[Hyung Jin Wook]</i>

1173
01:25:34,276 --> 01:25:37,396
<i>[Hyung Jin Wook, please meet me. I have something to say for the last time.]</i>

1174
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:49,124
<i>Jun Sik.</i>

1175
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:52,944
<i>Jun Sik!</i>

1176
01:25:56,116 --> 01:25:59,060
<i>Jun Sik! Jun Sik!</i>

1177
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:02,746
<i>J-Jun Sik...</i>

1178
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:06,975
<i>Hey, Jun Sik!</i>

1179
01:26:06,975 --> 01:26:09,812
<i>Jun Sik! Come to your senses, Jun Sik!</i>

1180
01:26:09,812 --> 01:26:13,615
<i>Jun Sik, Jun Sik!</i>

1181
01:26:15,186 --> 01:26:16,761
<i>Are you Chae Jin Wook?</i>

1182
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:18,180
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1183
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:21,767
<i>- You know Mr. Kim Jun Sik, right?
- Yes, I do know him.</i>

1184
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:26,487
<i>By the way... When was the last time you saw Mr. Kim Jun Sik?</i>

1185
01:26:30,082 --> 01:26:34,570
<i>The last person who talked to Mr. Kim, the victim of this Yeonma-dong incident,</i>

1186
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:37,600
<i>is you, Mr. Chae Jin Wook.</i>

1187
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,376
<i>Yes, well...</i>

1188
01:26:39,376 --> 01:26:42,028
<i>I did receive his text message...</i>

1189
01:26:42,028 --> 01:26:44,558
<i>Yes, I received his text.</i>

1190
01:26:44,558 --> 01:26:49,284
When you see that, where will I be?

1191
01:26:49,284 --> 01:26:54,298
Today's main focus is the conclusion of the Yeonma-dong murder case.

1192
01:26:55,999 --> 01:27:01,519
This person is the one who caused my precious Jun Sik's death,

1193
01:27:01,519 --> 01:27:04,799
<i>and the rest are his helpers.</i>

1194
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:08,268
<i>They came to us on their own, willing to die.</i>

1195
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:32,310
Then you knew everything

1196
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:34,645
and made us get the location-tracking app? Was that your plan?

1197
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:36,739
Yes.

1198
01:27:37,565 --> 01:27:40,818
I had to know where you were.

1199
01:27:40,818 --> 01:27:43,583
Also, you would have needed my location to find me.

1200
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:47,202
You're the one who snooped through Ji Won's phone, right?

1201
01:27:47,909 --> 01:27:53,514
Anyone who puts Seung Joo in danger needs to be eliminated.

1202
01:27:53,514 --> 01:27:56,059
Now I know.

1203
01:27:56,059 --> 01:28:01,080
Nothing will go your way if you just stand by and watch.

1204
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:16,145
This finale is going to be intense.

1205
01:28:16,145 --> 01:28:22,610
Students played detective and chased the suspect, Chae Jin Wook,

1206
01:28:23,169 --> 01:28:28,216
and the suspect got into an argument with the students.

1207
01:28:28,216 --> 01:28:31,601
The suspect's anger flared into a physical fight.

1208
01:28:31,601 --> 01:28:36,420
Afterward, he committed suicide by setting a fire.

1209
01:28:40,837 --> 01:28:43,929
Everyone involved in this incident died,

1210
01:28:43,929 --> 01:28:49,568
and the suspect, Chae Jin Wook, also died!

1211
01:28:51,764 --> 01:28:54,826
That's how this case will close.

1212
01:28:54,826 --> 01:28:58,229
You should get out of here now.

1213
01:28:58,229 --> 01:29:00,273
What are you talking about?

1214
01:29:00,273 --> 01:29:02,792
This is the long-awaited highlight.

1215
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:05,403
Are you filming this for your YouTube video?

1216
01:29:05,403 --> 01:29:07,590
You're crazier than I thought!

1217
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,750
Listen...

1218
01:29:08,755 --> 01:29:11,092
Do you think there will be a better scenario than this?

1219
01:29:11,092 --> 01:29:13,344
Light the fire.

1220
01:29:13,344 --> 01:29:14,829
I'm going to upload the video very soon.

1221
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:16,205
Hey!

1222
01:29:16,205 --> 01:29:18,875
If you upload this, it will be the end for us!

1223
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:22,869
- Turn off the camera, you crazy jerk!
- What are you saying? Darn it.

1224
01:29:23,749 --> 01:29:25,923
Jeong Seung Joo!

1225
01:29:27,024 --> 01:29:29,600
If you act like this, I won't let it slide, even if it's you.

1226
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,176
Just a little more.

1227
01:29:34,849 --> 01:29:36,558
What the heck?

1228
01:29:45,151 --> 01:29:46,319
What?

1229
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:48,895
What are you doing, you crazy jerk?

1230
01:29:55,762 --> 01:29:58,029
Are you going to stab me?
