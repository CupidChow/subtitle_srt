Jun Sik, are you okay?

44
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,680
Just don't bother about it.

I've been hiding my feelings.

51
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,713
But looking at you struggling, I can't help it anymore.

52
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,605
I'm not into you.

53
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,283
Why not?

54
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,102
You're not Jin Wook.

55

Jun Sik...

56
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,703
Please go now.

I'm saying this because I'm a bit tipsy.

61
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,618
You freak me out.

62

Stop staring at me.

63
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,441

Let me go.

65
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:55,578

Let's talk.

70

72

99
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:30,761
Yes, I do know him--

100
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:35,181
When was the last time you saw Mr. Kim?

101
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:45,700
You are the last person who talked to Mr. Kim, the victim of the Yeonma-dong incident.

Right...

103
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,822
I did receive his text message...

104
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,115
Yes, I received his text.

105
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,520
Today was another productive workout session.

106
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,980
Mr. Jeong Seung Joo?

107
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,576
It would be great if you could accommodate the investigation once more.

108
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,790

110
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:22,144
The most important thing of today is the conclusion of the Yeonma-dong murder case.

111
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,000
This person is the one who caused my precious Jun Sik's death.

115
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,726

116
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,720
Yes.

117
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,899
I had to know where you are.

118
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,652
Also, you need my location to find me.

119
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,071
You are the one who lurked at Ji Won's phone, right?

120
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,495
Everyone who puts Seung Joo in danger needs to be eliminated.

121
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,040
Now I know.

122
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,061
Nothing happens if you just watch.

123
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:44,226
The finale is going to be hot.

124
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:50,582
Students played detective and chased the suspect, Chae Jin Wook.

125
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,197
And the suspect got into an argument with the students.

126
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,682
The suspect couldn't control his anger and got into a physical fight.

127
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:04,264
Then, he committed suicide by setting up a fire.

128
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,010
Everyone who was involved in this incident died,

129
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,540
and the suspect, Chae Jin Wook,

130
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,567
also died!

131
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,807
That's how the case is going to close.

132
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,210
You should get out of here now.

133
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,354

Set up the fire.

140
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,810
