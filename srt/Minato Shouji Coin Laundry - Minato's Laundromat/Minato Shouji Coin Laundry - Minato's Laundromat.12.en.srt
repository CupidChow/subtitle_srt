1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:01,648
From now on,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,605
I'll stop seeing you.

3
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:07,140
Shin.

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,437
Why?

5
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:11,979
Until the exam is over.

6
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:17,017
I've thought it through.

7
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:19,620
Even if...

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,189
I go to school and keep seeing you like this,

9
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:24,918
I'm sure I can pass the entrance exam.

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,228
But just not a hundred percent.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,165
And if I can't get into the university,

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,502
you will...

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,105
blame yourself for it.

14
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:41,950
And I don't want you...

15
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,511
to feel that way.

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,882
So from now on,

17
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:51,885
I'll face the exam

18
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,421
with my own power,

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,500
with all my responsibility.

20
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,462
And I will pass the exam

21
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,465
and come back to you again.

22
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:10,270
What's the matter with you?

23
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,873
You should have said it sooner.

24
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:14,613
Jeez.

25
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:16,710
You totally shocked me for a moment.

26
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:23,784
The exam result will be out in March.

27
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,353
So this half year,

28
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:29,058
I'll work hard on the exam.

29
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:35,011
Okay.

30
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:36,331
I got it.

31
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,033
Either way, I'll always support you.

32
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,070
Thank you.

33
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:44,605
You can do it, Shin.

34
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,105
Yes.

35
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,292
Excuse me, then.

36
00:01:58,295 --> 00:01:59,486
Half a year?

37
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:07,205
"Minato Shouji Coin Laundry."

38
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,541
I like you, Shuu-kun.

39
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,399
Very much.

40
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,097
So I can be a cat.

41
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:19,166
Either a cat or a dog.

42
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:20,756
Or a monkey or a pheasant.

43
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,685
Just let me be by your side.

44
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,466
Why...

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,772
must I be a Momotaro?

46
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,574
It's not like that.

47
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:30,877
I'm saying...

48
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,748
I like you very, very, very much.

49
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,889
You're really...

50
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,357
a crazy one.

51
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:08,044
I got it.

52
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,518
Just do as you please.

53
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,037
Really?

54
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:15,615
Yes.

55
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,095
But is it enough

56
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,300
to just be by my side

57
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,201
like that?

58
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:32,599
Wouldn't it be a waste of time for you?

59
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,521
Being with the one I like

60
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,691
is never a waste of time.

61
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,537
Shuu-kun.

62
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:03,484
(Standard Main Course)

63
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:05,799
(Hamburg)

64
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,142
Akira-san.

65
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:11,321
Oh, Asuka.

66
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:12,679
It's been a while.

67
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,985
What? Are you cooking something?

68
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,322
Oh, it's not that.

69
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:24,925
I'm not doing anything.

70
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,494
Are you missing Shin's food?

71
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:30,730
Jeez, you're so easy to read.

72
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:31,873
It's not that.

73
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,367
Whatever. Forget about that.

74
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:36,403
I want to ask about Shin.

75
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,205
- About Shin?
- Yes.

76
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:41,942
Right now, I'm going out with Shuu-kun.

77
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,642
What do you mean?

78
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,844
It's exactly what you think.

79
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:45,812
But...

80
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,181
he's more interested
in architecture than in me.

81
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:49,816
He's a difficult one, I'd say.

82
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:52,451
So I really wonder...

83
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:55,555
how Shin approached Akira-san?

84
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,857
Say that you like me.

85
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:01,962
Well, then...

86
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,126
Hey!

87
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:11,638
Jeez, you're blushing.

88
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,073
I'm not.

89
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,842
Come on, tell me.

90
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:16,877
I asked Shin, and he refused to tell me.

91
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:18,111
Shut up already.

92
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:20,247
Go figure it out yourself.

93
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:21,114
What?

94
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:22,580
Come on, tell me.

95
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:24,281
You remembered something, didn't you?

96
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:25,361
Akira-san.

97
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:28,622
Sensei.

98
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,150
You guys.

99
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:31,725
- Hello.
- Hello.

100
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:33,260
Akira-kun, it's been a while.

101
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:34,353
How have you been?

102
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,720
I've been well.

103
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:37,631
So what's the occasion?

104
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,933
Everyone just wants to see you.

105
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,972
Once the senior year leaves the club,

106
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:47,621
they must prepare for the exam right away.

107
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,001
So it seems that they're having a hard time adjusting.

108
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:53,642
What about Shin?

109
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,449
Is he working hard for exams?

110
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:57,829
Yes.

111
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,552
He keeps reading his books all the time.

112
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,388
So much so that even I got worried.

113
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,892
That punk.

114
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,863
He said he won't see me
until the exam is over.

115
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,532
He's worried about my feelings.

116
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:17,370
That I'll blame myself
if he can't get into the university.

117
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,708
How crazy must he be to think like that?

118
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:26,913
I'll have to say that both, Shintaro-kun and Akira-kun

119
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:28,615
are rather similar.

120
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:32,852
Both of you

121
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,288
always care about others.

122
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,760
And I adore you guys for that.

123
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:42,650
You two

124
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:45,131
are undoubtedly my most important students.

125
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:46,900
So...

126
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,936
I hope for the both of you
to be able to smile happily.

127
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,440
That's what I wish for.

128
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,148
Coach.

129
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:03,750
Thank you so much.

130
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,118
- See you.
- See you.

131
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,686
Thank you very much.

132
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,754
Take care, everyone.

133
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,855
Bye.

134
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:25,972
The only person

135
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,113
I'll like in this life

136
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,913
is Minato Akira.

137
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,151
I like you so much.

138
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,353
But why can't I be the person

139
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,423
that you like?

140
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,274
Minato-san.

141
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,458
It's been a while.

142
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:22,098
Shin.

143
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,807
(Minato)

144
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:34,490
You've passed the exam. Congratulations!

145
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,718
(Celebrating passing the exam)
You must be so elated.

146
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,826
Seeing how you have prepared so much.

147
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:44,484
You tried so hard for it.
How could I not give my best shot too?

148
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,054
I also tried hard
to level up my cooking skills.

149
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:49,889
All right. Dig in.

150
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,438
Yes.

151
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,063
Thank you for the food.

152
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:01,360
How is it?

153
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:05,105
This is the most delicious dish

154
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,619
I've ever eaten in my life.

155
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:12,045
Your habit of exaggerating
hasn't changed at all.

156
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:15,610
It must have been hard for you

157
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,784
preparing for the exam.

158
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,539
Yes.

159
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,610
But...

160
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:25,475
thanks to this amulet

161
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,139
you bought for me in Tokyo,

162
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:28,891
I could keep trying hard to the end.

163
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:31,610
Is that right?

164
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,728
You must have tried really hard then.

165
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:42,934
All right.

166
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:44,496
Let's dig in.

167
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:48,348
There's still a lot of food in the fridge.

168
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:08,344
Here.

169
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:13,828
Dry it well.

170
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,140
What's wrong with this?

171
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:17,219
It's not good enough.

172
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:18,978
And put the plate upright.

173
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:23,149
All right. I got it, Mr. Clean Freak.

174
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,936
I told you to just sit still.

175
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,176
You know, even doing the dishes together
can cause people to fight.

176
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:30,954
Even so,

177
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,576
it's faster than you doing it alone.

178
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:36,596
Do you want me to leave so much?

179
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:37,922
Nonsense.

180
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,242
That's not what I meant.

181
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,508
Don't you know that I...

182
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,938
want to be with you as long as possible?

183
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,101
Minato-san.

184
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,086
I'm hesitating
whether or not I should go to Tokyo.

185
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,061
Minato-san.

186
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,672
What do you think?

187
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,192
Well...

188
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,875
do you...

189
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,375
want me...

190
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,601
to be by your side?

191
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,046
How do you feel about me?

192
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:29,461
I'd like to hear it.

193
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,764
For you, I'm sure

194
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,863
there's a brighter future in Tokyo

195
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:49,986
than being with someone like me.

196
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:55,808
- But...
- I knew

197
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,412
you would say this.

198
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,165
So...

199
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,189
thank you for the food today.

200
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,203
What's that nonsense?

201
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,875
What do you mean you knew?

202
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,316
I don't care about his future anymore.

203
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,236
For me, Shin is...

204
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,124
My feelings for him...

205
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,437
Shin.

206
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,148
What the hell am I doing?

207
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,603
What sort of a jerk am I?

208
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:33,039
Akira-san.

209
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,629
Shin's about to leave today.

210
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,009
Are you going to let him?

211
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,181
Minato-san.

212
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,650
Here's a letter from Shin.

213
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:50,890
I won't read it.

214
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:53,726
I won't think of him anymore.

215
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,161
Just read it.

216
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,409
This may be the last time.

217
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:03,936
Okay.

218
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,118
To Minato Akira-san,

219
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,266
Let me give you a heads up.

220
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,422
This is not a love letter.

221
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:28,327
I'm writing this
solely to complain about you.

222
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:31,097
Please read until the end.

223
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:33,281
What?

224
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:35,601
Complaining?

225
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,237
Shin, you punk.

226
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:41,707
Since ten years ago,

227
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:45,959
when you saved me from drowning in the sea,

228
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,781
you've had a place in my heart

229
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,416
without asking me for my permission.

230
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,619
And when I saw...

231
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,955
you crying at the laundromat,

232
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,691
you engraved yourself in it even more.

233
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,396
You're my first love.

234
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,632
Last summer

235
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:09,469
when I met you again at the laundromat,

236
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,738
my feeling of joy at that time...

237
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:14,373
I don't think...

238
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,608
you'll ever be able to understand it.

239
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:19,133
I was so glad.

240
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,525
So much so that I couldn't put it into words.

241
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,452
And given you aren't the decisive type,

242
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:28,521
I thought if I kept pressuring you,

243
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,990
I might be able to win your heart someday.

244
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,734
But I've realized

245
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,795
nothing is that easy in this world.

246
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:39,940
What have you done to me?

247
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,903
I think I'll miss Minato Akira

248
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:45,805
both now...

249
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,441
and forever.

250
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,480
So please live a happy life

251
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:56,913
or I won't forgive you.

252
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,721
And I won't see you ever again.

253
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,130
Last but not least,

254
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:09,629
you aren't that young anymore.

255
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:12,604
Cut down on the fried food.

256
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:17,211
Moreover,

257
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:18,437
when you sleep,

258
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,973
please make sure
not to let your stomach get cold.

259
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,209
Also,

260
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:25,578
you're a good-natured person.

261
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:28,881
Be careful not to let strangers approach you.

262
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:32,961
Gosh, this is hard.

263
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:35,555
The more I think about you,

264
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,281
The more I want to be
by your side and protect you.

265
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,657
It's an incredible feeling.

266
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,630
Have I gone crazy?

267
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:45,798
Minato Akira.

268
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:49,079
I like you.

269
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:52,084
I love you.

270
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:54,914
I really want to go to you right now.

271
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:58,368
But...

272
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:00,179
Goodbye.

273
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,624
Shin.

274
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:23,685
Minato-san.

275
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,133
Why?

276
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:28,975
I like you.

277
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,379
Even if you have to go to Tokyo,

278
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,848
I'll be waiting for you here for as long as it takes.

279
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:38,141
"I'll never see you again"?

280
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:40,659
Don't say anything
that feels so lonely like that, idiot.

281
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,772
I'm already a bad adult.

282
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,775
It's not that I don't care about your future
and trying to let go.

283
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,149
And I won't

284
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,970
run away from the pain again.

285
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:57,137
I...

286
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,372
like you more than anyone.

287
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:05,701
I know it probably can't ever compare
to all that you've done for me.

288
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,086
But...

289
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,857
I'll be here waiting for you
at the laundromat, even if it takes forever.

290
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,825
To repay you...

291
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,334
for your feelings for me all this time.

292
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,163
Minato-san.

293
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,285
The school I'm going to
is a local university.

294
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,429
Not in Tokyo.

295
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,074
I chose a local medical university here.

296
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,876
Wait.

297
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:38,789
What about...

298
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,297
those boxes?

299
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,016
Oh, that.

300
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:44,917
It's my dad.

301
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:46,219
He's moving for work.

302
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,391
What about the letter?

303
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,524
Oh, that.

304
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,964
That's the letter I wrote for you

305
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,470
in case I was going to Tokyo.

306
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:00,930
But it's impossible for me to not see you.

307
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,040
So I never meant for you to receive the letter.

308
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,764
I'd asked Sakurako to throw it away.

309
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,608
Those punks...

310
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:12,152
totally got me fooled.

311
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:22,997
By the way, Minato-san,

312
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,317
did you mean every word you said just now?

313
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,331
Do you truly like me?

314
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,384
Are you sure I'm the one for you?

315
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:51,014
I told you, didn't I?

316
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,514
The only person I will love in this life

317
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,965
is Minato Ak...

318
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,774
Finally.

319
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:29,755
I'm so happy for them.

320
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:35,777
Shuu-kun.

321
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,136
Maybe love...

322
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,834
is a good thing.

323
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:44,303
- It is, right?
- It is, right?

324
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:21,644
I love you.

325
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,057
That's too much.

326
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:39,042
Are you killing me?

327
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,659
It's not enough for me.

328
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:41,769
Wait a minute.

329
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:43,462
Calm down, will you?

330
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,504
Don't rush things.

331
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,999
What do you mean?
I've waited for ten years.

332
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:49,023
I was waiting for you too.

333
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:50,469
It was just half a year.

334
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,605
All right. I got it.
Just calm down.

335
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,465
Jeez, I'm all wet again.

336
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:06,410
It's all your fault.

337
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,152
Shin.

338
00:23:12,355 --> 00:23:14,160
How about drying your clothes at my place?

339
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,801
Are you leading me on?

340
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,379
That's right.

341
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:34,139
At Minato's Laundromat
which is loved by the locals,

342
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,675
no matter how sticky the stain is,

343
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:39,044
your cloth will be
