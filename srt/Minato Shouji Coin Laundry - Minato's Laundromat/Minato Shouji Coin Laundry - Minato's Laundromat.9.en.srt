Bye, Akira-kun.

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,608
- Thank you.
- See you.

Today marks another busy day for the laundromat

7
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,999
as it continues to bustle with its regular customers.

ever since that day...

10
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,687
I never saw Shin again.

11
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:23,796
I can't date you.

12
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:25,388
Is this...

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,107
your answer?

14
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:32,533
Yes, it is.

15
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:37,633
Pull yourself together.

16
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:39,365
Minato Akira.

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,310

You have finally gotten back on track.

after the summer course,

Shintaro-kun.

24
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:02,596
You did very well.

25
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,831
Thank you.

26
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:09,436
Well, Sensei...

27
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,207
can I have a minute?

Why are you here?

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,147

00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:48,368
What, what are you doing?

35
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,004
The mock exam

36
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:52,703
for the university I want to get in.

37
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,128
I got an A.

38
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:55,938
Awesome!

39
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,571
Well done, Shin.

40
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:02,595
Jeez, you've tried so hard for it.

41
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:06,713
And...

42
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:09,202
to pave a lovely path
for you and Sakuma-sensei,

43
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:12,184
I did some research.

44
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,864
As a son of a candy store,

45
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,233
Sakuma-sensei really likes sweets.

46
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,935
Especially jelly.

47
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,904
His hobby include reading and

48
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,480
he also enjoys looking at statues of Buddha.

49
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,907
His favorite color is blue.

50
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,055
I took a lot of pictures too.

51
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,758
Pictures?

52
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:34,531
Here.

53
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:38,351
Hey, what's this?
You secretly took his photos.

54
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:43,590
This was when he's eating
his homemade character bento.

55
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,692
What's the character bento?

56
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:47,094
And what character is this?

57
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,931
This was when he was looking for his phone.

58
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:53,147
It's hanging around his neck.
But he didn't realize it.

59
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:54,835
That's typical of him.

60
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,403
You should have told him.

61
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:58,773
I have more photos of him.

62
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:00,991
I will collect them all and send them to you.

63
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:03,422
Okay. Thank you.

64
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:05,385
Are you crazy?

65
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,442
Why should you do that?

66
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,414
Shin.

67
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,748
I think you're misunderstanding something.

68
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:15,927
I want to erase the dark past
between Sakuma-sensei and me.

69
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:19,236
- Not to make amends...
- I already told you.

70
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,883
The only person I'll like in this life

71
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:24,251
is Minato Akira.

72
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,301
For the fact that you can't date me,

73
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,339
I can't help but accept it.

74
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,189
But...

75
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:39,228
I want to get close to your heart
as much as possible.

76
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,514
I want to feel that your happiness

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,985
is my happiness.

78
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:47,744
No.

79
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,525
- I told you that you...
- I...

80
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:52,750
have decided that I'll be rooting for you.

81
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:55,542
Rooting for me?

82
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,022
Sakurako-chan.

83
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,606
Asuka-san.

84
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,940
It's been a while.

85
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,222
Yeah, since Shin's birthday party.
How are you?

86
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:15,855
Rooting for him?

87
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:20,090
Shin was officially rejected by Minato-san.

88
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:22,555
But he still wants to be by his side

89
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,359
and is helping Minato-san to win his former love.

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,443
What do you mean

91
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,264
by Akira's love?

92
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,760
Does he have a crush on someone?

93
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:38,492
I think the person is Shin's advisor.

94
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:39,983
What?

95
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:44,878
I knew it. I sensed something between them.

96
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,013
I feel so sorry for Shin.

97
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,650
What should I say?

98
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,528
Shin's indeed going through a tough time.

99
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:56,004
He wants to root for him?

100
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:59,940
I'd say that's typical of him.

101
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,564
It's not that I hate this nature of his.

102
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:09,209
I think your brother is really awesome

103
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:12,372
to be able to like someone that much.

104
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:14,982
Do you also think so?

105
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,313
At first, I kinda teased him about it.

106
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:22,420
But then...

107
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,258
I found myself laughing at him.

108
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:29,522
Even now,

109
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:32,767
deeply in my heart, I secretly root for him.

110
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,429
Thank you so much

111
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:38,453
for talking about Shin like that.

112
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,705
I feel much better after talking to you.

113
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:43,678
Thanks to you,

114
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:46,474
I now have the courage to move forward.

115
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:49,958
I told you earlier

116
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:51,757
about Shuu-sensei.

117
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:55,382
He's my tutor. He's really cool.

118
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:58,795
Oh, that.

119
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,694
But Sakurako-chan,
by moving forward, you mean...

120
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:03,818
Yes.

121
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:05,503
I'm going to...

122
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,448
confess my love to Shuu-sensei.

123
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,477
Confess your love?

124
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:13,300
I mean...

125
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,835
I think you should give up on your plan...

126
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,279
Why?

127
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,972
I mean, Shuu-kun...

128
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:21,804
He may look good,
but his room is a total mess.

129
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:22,754
Shuu-kun?

130
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,011
If you notice, he always wears
the same outfit over and over.

131
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,035
I'd say he's a lousy guy.

132
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:30,083
Asuka-san. Do you know Shuu-sensei?

133
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:37,248
Yes. Actually, we know each other quite well.

134
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,661
The guy is a total architecture maniac.

135
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:44,195
He can talk nonstop when it comes to architecture.

136
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,800
- That's so cute.
- Cute?

137
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:50,676
When a man is obsessed with something,
I find that wonderful.

138
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,139
After hearing you talk about him,

139
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:55,865
I even like Shuu-sensei even more.

140
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,282
Listen on.

141
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,985
You never know what he's thinking.
He's totally free spirited.

142
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:08,421
Since I met Shuu-sensei,

143
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,983
my everyday life isn't so boring anymore.

144
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:11,645
So...

145
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,365
I won't regret it,
no matter how it turns out.

146
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:17,209
Now that I learned it from Shin,
I'll try to do the same.

147
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:19,799
Wait, Sakurako-chan.

148
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:22,802
Thank you very much for your advice.

149
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:31,978
I'm so doomed.

150
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,869
I didn't expect it would push her even more.

151
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,897
That tower...

152
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,027
looks like the Sagrada Familia.

153
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:45,287
Sagrada Familia.

154
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:49,256
It is an unfinished cathedral
in Barcelona, Spain.

155
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:51,753
It's the work of the genius Gaudi

156
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:56,114
who dedicated his life,
thoughts, faith, craftsmanship

157
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:59,239
and his soul to create it.

158
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,081
Mommy.

159
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,068
You really haven't changed, Shuu-kun.

160
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,698
Oh, here.

161
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,842
Gaudi's Special that you asked me
to record the other day.

162
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,717
Thank you.

163
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,920
Wait.

164
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:29,678
Katsuki Sakurako-chan,
she's in your class, right?

165
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,279
Yes.

166
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:35,377
If such a cute girl approaches you,

167
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:37,402
you will probably say yes, right?

168
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:39,686
Why do you ask?

169
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:41,928
You'll like her, won't you?

170
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,853
All this time,
I've never thought about love or hate.

171
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,479
I don't quite understand dating.

172
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:54,050
What do you mean you don't understand?

173
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,075
Are you saying...

174
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,631
the time we were dating...

175
00:09:58,655 --> 00:09:59,858
We were not dating.

176
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,699
That was just pretending.

177
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,338
When we were abroad, we were approached

178
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:07,440
by many scammers
and were prone to being targeted.

179
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:10,107
So we decided to pretend that we're dating.

180
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,795
This is my boyfriend.

181
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,385
What did you say just now?

182
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,521
I said, "This is my boyfriend."

183
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:26,371
But since I agreed to do it,

184
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:29,369
we went everywhere as lovers all the time.

185
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:30,939
So I...

186
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,967
I seriously thought that you...

187
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,441
Uh, no.

188
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:42,504
I just thought...

189
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,749
you probably thought the same thing.

190
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,218
Because Asuka...

191
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,822
is my cat.

192
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:11,174
Meow.

193
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:14,621
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

194
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,361
Shin, you...

195
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,900
Why must you try something so silly?

196
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,335
I want to feel that your happiness

197
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,592
is my happiness.

198
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,938
I gotta do it this time.

199
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:51,213
Let's get it over with.

200
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,581
Sensei.

201
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,115
Hey, Akira-kun.

202
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,258
Well...

203
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:01,541
are you all right?

204
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:05,743
I'm fine.

205
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,282
Sorry.

206
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:08,555
Well...

207
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,516
it's so hot today.

208
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,531
Could that be the heat stroke?

209
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:14,977
No.

210
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:17,586
I made sure I drank enough water.

211
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:21,836
See?

212
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,008
Well...

213
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:29,946
I mean...

214
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,743
do you think

215
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,887
you have some time to spare?

216
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:48,434
Okay.

217
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:49,816
Now is the time.

218
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:51,676
Now or never.

219
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,809
Sensei.

220
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,676
I...

221
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,220
Sensei.

222
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:08,736
What's the matter?

223
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:10,356
Sensei.

224
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:11,552
Sensei.

225
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,655
Minato-san, what happened?

226
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:14,861
I don't know.

227
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,328
He just collapsed.

228
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:21,913
Don't worry.

229
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,178
His heart is still beating.

230
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,481
We should call an ambulance.

231
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:26,960
Minato-san.

232
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:33,942
Drinking too much water?

233
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,182
The cause of Mr. Sakuma's collapse

234
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,817
was a heat stroke.

235
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:41,654
He drank too much water,
which diluted the salt in his blood.

236
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,190
We'll admit him
and keep him in check for a few days.

237
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,462
But please don't worry.

238
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:50,830
All right.

239
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:52,213
Excuse me.

240
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:58,127
What a relief.

241
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:06,004
Well...

242
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:07,826
thank you very much.

243
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:10,461
I really caused you two

244
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,852
some trouble, didn't I?

245
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:14,971
Thanks to you both,

246
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:16,956
I'm still alive.

247
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:20,682
We only wish that you're safe.

248
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:23,396
It's no trouble at all.

249
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,501
Oh, right.

250
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:31,208
We were talking about something.

251
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,039
I'm sorry for not really paying attention.

252
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,885
No, it's all right.

253
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,223
Don't worry about that.

254
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,268
Right now, I'd like for you...

255
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,445
to rest a lot and get well soon.

256
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,049
I'll take care of the swimming club.

257
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:50,523
Akira-kun.

258
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:52,385
Don't worry.

259
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,182
We're going to win this tournament.

260
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,311
I'll make sure everyone works hard for it.

261
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,667
I want those kids...

262
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,970
to get to see the beautiful scenery.

263
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,017
Thank you.

264
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,597
It's really nice to have you with us.

265
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,499
I'm counting on you.

266
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,636
For that reason,

267
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,532
Sakuma-sensei has to stay
at the hospital for a while.

268
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:33,236
But only for the observation.
So don't worry too much.

269
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,441
What we can do

270
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
is not make him worried.

271
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:39,958
Let's try our best.

272
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:41,839
- Yes.
- Yes.

273
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,206
All right.

274
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,709
Let's welcome him back with a smile.

275
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,260
Come on. Let's go.

276
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:49,297
All right.

277
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:50,690
Are you ready?

278
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:52,952
Ready.

279
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:02,682
Shin.

280
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:07,444
Wait.

281
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:11,034
Hey.

282
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:13,400
Are you going to root for Akira's love?

283
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:17,123
Are you sure about that?

284
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,544
Come on.

285
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:22,143
Even when they get along well
and end up dating?

286
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:28,803
Because Minato-san's happiness

287
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,313
is my happiness.

288
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,496
Hey, Shin. Wait.

289
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,333
(Open for trial classes)
That's all for today's class.

290
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:41,792
Thank you for your attention.

291
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:44,303
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

292
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:02,837
Shuu-sensei.

293
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:04,385
Uh...

294
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:09,176
Can I have a minute?

295
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,001
Hello.

296
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:15,997
Hello.

297
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,286
He's cheerful and kind.

298
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:24,664
I can really be at ease around him.

299
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,180
He may seem indecisive at times.

300
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,573
But that's because
he's considerate of others' feelings.

301
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:32,118
And I think

302
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:34,744
that's one of many good traits of Minato-san.

303
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,841
By the way, please keep this between us.

304
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:43,309
For you, he can...

305
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:47,706
Hi.

306
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,415
The weather is lovely today.

307
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:52,744
Akira-kun.

308
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:55,706
We were just talking about you.

309
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:56,809
Shin.

310
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:58,356
What are you doing?

311
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,513
While you were coaching at the swimming club,

312
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,317
Shintaro-kun came and said he'd accompany me.

313
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:05,878
I see.

314
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:07,885
Is that so?

315
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:10,122
Shintaro-kun...

316
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,139
seems to like Akira-kun a lot.

317
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,660
He told me many things about you.

318
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,763
How a wonderful person you were.

319
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:21,284
Sensei.

320
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:22,853
I may excuse myself now.

321
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,237
Right.

322
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:25,752
It's getting dark now.

323
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:27,406
Be careful on the way home.

324
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,471
Yes.

325
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:34,729
Shin.

326
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,268
Thank you.

327
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,340
What are you waiting for?

328
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:40,465
Go on and tell him how you feel.

329
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:41,587
Are you crazy?

330
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,656
You aren't making any sense.

331
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:50,449
Akira-kun.

332
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,878
Thank you for your hard work.

333
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:55,034
How is everyone doing?

334
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,126
Oh, right.

335
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:00,245
They are eagerly practicing hard.

336
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,244
Here.

337
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,969
(To Sakuma-sensei, we'll be waiting for you.)

338
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:07,635
(We wish you a speedy recovery.)
Some notes from everyone in the club.

339
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,082
Everyone is waiting to welcome you back.

340
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:14,827
I also want to meet everyone soon.

341
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:23,886
I'm back.

342
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,999
Welcome back.

343
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:29,535
Sakurako, what happened?

344
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:34,077
I'm making Tonkatsu
to wish you luck with your exam.

345
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,996
Is all of that cabbage for the side dish?

346
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:38,688
Isn't it a bit too much?

347
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:44,830
What's going on?

348
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,006
Shuu-sensei.

349
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,436
I like you.

350
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,280
Can you please go out with me?

351
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,915
I appreciate your feeling for me.

352
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:05,384
But I'm sorry.

353
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,318
"We, humans, have no freedom.

354
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:20,480
but...

355
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:23,297
freedom resides in human needs.”

356
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,697
It's one of Gaudi's famous quotes.

357
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,060
In his life, he had three loves in total.

358
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:31,363
All of them were unrequited loves.

359
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,652
But...

360
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:36,477
he used those burning sensations
to create many famous architectures.

361
00:20:37,232 --> 00:20:38,772
Those art pieces...

362
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,753
were so colorful and all those curves...

363
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:44,364
some critics even interpreted it
as love letters

364
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:46,388
he sent to his unforgettable love.

365
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,550
Well...

366
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,444
I may not understood what he said.

367
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,130
But I think...

368
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,654
I got rejected.

369
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:03,763
Sakurako.

370
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:29,255
Loving someone

371
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,771
can hurt.

372
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:42,607
I confessed my love to Shuu-sensei.

373
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:44,044
(Asuka-san, please listen to me.)
But I got rejected.

374
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:44,950
(I confessed my love to Shuu-sensei.
But I got rejected.)

375
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:49,842
Wait.

376
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,577
Did I feel relieved just now?

377
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:53,646
No way.

378
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,650
I'm such a jerk.

379
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:18,958
All this time,
I've never thought about love or hate.

380
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:21,359
I don't quite understand dating.

381
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,099
Asuka, what's wrong?

382
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:37,256
It's like I'm hearing
the music of the world ending.

383
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,259
What are you talking about?

384
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,529
Hello?

385
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,013
Asuka-kun.

386
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:51,517
Hey!

387
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,241
Akira-san.

388
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:56,976
Please help me.

389
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,757
We've been neighbors all this time.

390
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,413
So we're friends, right?

391
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:03,599
I got it. But please stop this.

392
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:06,015
Why are you so cold?

393
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:07,896
Zero-degree cold.

394
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:11,678
You clearly see I'm going through
this lovesick moment.

395
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:13,091
Asuka.

396
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:15,029
What's going on?

397
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:17,686
I really don't know what to do.

398
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:24,412
Shuu-kun.

399
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:28,822
The season is changing.

400
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:30,951
Please take care and stay well.

401
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:34,382
I hope you don't catch an unexpected cold.

402
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,916
Minato's Laundromat

403
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:39,818
will be looking forward to seeing you

404
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:41,353
next week as well.

405
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:45,471
(Next Episode)

406
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:48,395
(Thorns in his heart)
You really care about Akira-kun.

407
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,422
I wonder what you think.

408
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:51,924
(The back being pushed)
You gotta tell him

409
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,292
your true feelings.

410
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:55,194
(Finally, the answer from ten years ago...)
My feeling for you...

411
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:57,096
As long as Minato-san is happy.

412
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,664
(This drama is fictional.)
My feeling for you...

413
00:24:58,835 --> 00:24:59,901
(This drama is fictional.)
was real.
