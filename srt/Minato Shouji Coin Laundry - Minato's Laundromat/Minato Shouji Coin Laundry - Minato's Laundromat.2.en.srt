1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,886
A run-down coin laundry

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:05,935
inherited from my grandfather

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,734
The main customers...

4
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:12,922
are elderly people, homemakers,
and people in the neighborhood.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,155
And lately...

6
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,651
Minato-san.

7
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:23,374
Hey, Shin.

8
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:27,847
Good morning.

9
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,860
Good morning.

10
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,596
Can I come to your place tonight?

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,081
I'll make deep-fried aji fish.

12
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:36,266
Deep-fried aji fish?

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,036
Sounds nice.

14
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,196
But...

15
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,490
You can't come to my place.

16
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:47,611
Why not?

17
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:49,818
The thing is...

18
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:52,398
Akira-chan, I'll be off now.

19
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:54,911
- Thank you. See you.
- Yes, see you all.

20
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:56,019
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,070
- Get home safe.
- All right.

22
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:00,257
Minato-san.

23
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:01,992
Why can't I come?

24
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,127
Why can't you come?

25
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,492
I also have desires.

26
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:10,767
The way you smile, pout, feel embarrassed...

27
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:12,907
The way your expressions change constantly.

28
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:14,695
I think it's really cute.

29
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:18,829
It's because you have a crush on me.

30
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,808
"Minato's Laundromat"

31
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,737
It's so hot today.

32
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:39,551
Shin, let's go inside.

33
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,150
How about some juice?

34
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,843
Minato-san.

35
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:50,233
I really can't come to your house tonight?

36
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,053
No, you can't.

37
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,527
I'll bring homemade shiokara too.

38
00:02:57,668 --> 00:02:59,376
The lemon kind.

39
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:03,580
Oh boy. That sounds so good.

40
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:07,201
Deep-fried aji and shiokara made by Shin.

41
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:10,029
Boy, I'd love to have some.

42
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:16,426
You still can't come.

43
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,994
Why not?

44
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:19,830
Why?

45
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:22,065
We're friends.

46
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:24,040
And yet I can't come to your place.
That's just weird.

47
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:26,570
Oh no, no, no.

48
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:29,291
I'm a sucker for a face like that.

49
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:32,576
Your face is getting too close.

50
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:38,874
Your good looks are catching.

51
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:41,747
What would you do
if I became more handsome than I am now?

52
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:42,823
That couldn't ever happen.

53
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,377
How can you say that so casually?

54
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:47,124
Besides, stop running away like this.

55
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:49,726
Nonsense. I'm not running away.

56
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,630
I always face everything head-on, dumbass.

57
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:55,132
You're obviously running away.

58
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:56,652
I'm not.

59
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,537
So tonight...

60
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:03,378
I really can't come over?

61
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:06,262
No.

62
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,779
I'm only coming over

63
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,248
to eat some fried aji fish and shiokara.

64
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:13,650
Why can't I?

65
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:17,854
Given that we're friends.

66
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,795
Shin.

67
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,934
Saying "we're friends" won't do the trick.

68
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,390
All right, I get it.

69
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,414
What a shame.

70
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:44,648
He's sulking.

71
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,883
What? Don't laugh at me.

72
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,886
Shin, don't be like this.

73
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:53,223
If you bring the food here,
we can enjoy it together.

74
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:55,134
Shameless.

75
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,594
I'm going to eat all the shiokara myself.

76
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:00,092
Why?

77
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:04,968
We're friends.

78
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,029
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

79
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:11,889
Oh, you got me.

80
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,850
Come on, don't get upset, Shin-chan.

81
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,889
Stop it.

82
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:22,552
Come on, don't sulk.

83
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,631
Who's sulking?

84
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:26,291
You've read this one, right?

85
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:34,116
Hey, Akira-kun!

86
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,165
Hello.

87
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,280
We have hotate scallops today. Want some?

88
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,328
Hotate scallops?

89
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:39,846
They're just about right.

90
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,373
I really got big ones today.

91
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:48,245
Good. I'll take them.

92
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,966
That's what I'm talking about.

93
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,139
Here.

94
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,122
You got the highest score
on the test as usual, Katsuki-kun.

95
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,343
But make sure not to slack off.

96
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:00,599
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,845
Well, Katsuki.

98
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:09,754
The questionnaire about the sports event.

99
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:13,169
The student council wants it submitted
within the next week.

100
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,138
Understood. Thank you.

101
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,276
Katsuki-kun is so cool.

102
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,810
He made eye contact with me too.

103
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,178
No way.

104
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,791
Fresh hotate scallops. Appetizing, right?

105
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,923
Whoever shows up first will get a reward.

106
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,512
I'll bring a charcoal grill.

107
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,313
A charcoal grill?

108
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:46,970
Do you have one?

109
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,774
My grandpa uses it often.

110
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:55,145
That's great.

111
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:56,980
I'm looking forward to it.

112
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:03,687
I really can't wait to see you.

113
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,819
Wow, the talented Katsuki-kun is smiling.

114
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,221
It's Hanabusa Asuka.

115
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,502
Your classmate.

116
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:21,972
Don't you remember me?

117
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:28,409
Your attitude is way different
from when you talk on the phone.

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,649
I get it. It's your girlfriend.

119
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:42,158
I'm really curious who it is.

120
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:43,542
Hey!

121
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,195
Akira?

122
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,642
This is getting interesting.

123
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,896
Asuka, are you free today?

124
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,123
- Yeah.
- Let's go to karaoke.

125
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,164
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

126
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:08,018
See you at the station.

127
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,056
Okay.

128
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:14,357
Nice, it's almost ready.

129
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,628
- Here.
- Thank you so much.

130
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:33,730
It's great.

131
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:36,012
The hotate is delicious.

132
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:38,386
Shin, you should try some.

133
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:39,519
Okay.

134
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,125
Did something happen?

135
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:51,795
No, it's nothing.

136
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:56,099
You should adjust your mood, Shin-chan.

137
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,004
If you feed me,
I'll be in a better mood.

138
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,343
It can't be helped then.

139
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:11,624
Here.

140
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:13,450
Open your mouth.

141
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:18,232
Minato-san!

142
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:20,757
Gotcha.

143
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,696
If something's bothering you,
just spit it out.

144
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,305
It's nothing.

145
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,639
There must be something.

146
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:39,175
You know, like, your future path.

147
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,643
Your dreams.

148
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,246
You have dreams, right?

149
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,449
But I'm not telling you.

150
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,745
What?

151
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:49,057
Why not?

152
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,555
We're friends, right?

153
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:01,829
Just kidding.

154
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,189
If you don't want to talk, that's fine.

155
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:10,284
A doctor.

156
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:11,832
Really?

157
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:15,899
Why a doctor?

158
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,381
When I was in middle school,

159
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:21,487
I injured my back,
so I had to stop swimming.

160
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:23,753
Ah, your back.

161
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,855
Injuries are always the problem.

162
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,258
I took swimming seriously.

163
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,394
So I couldn't bring myself to accept it.

164
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,331
But during that time,

165
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:38,535
my doctor kindly listened to my worries.

166
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,230
So that's the reason
I want to become like him.

167
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,659
Lame, right?

168
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:46,609
Even I find it funny.

169
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:56,452
What are you on about?

170
00:10:58,444 --> 00:10:59,923
To hit rock bottom like that

171
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,844
and still keep looking forward.
You're very impressive.

172
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,164
Shin.

173
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,312
Want to study over at my place?

174
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,620
Can I?

175
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:12,645
Yes, at my coin laundry.

176
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:14,871
I thought you meant your home.

177
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:15,905
No way.

178
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,670
Actually, you can use this place too.

179
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,428
What?

180
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:24,814
Now what are you mad about?

181
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,418
Hey.

182
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:34,177
Katsuki Shintaro-kun, my friend.

183
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,073
Hey.

184
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:40,697
- Shin-chan!
- Stop it!

185
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,721
- Come on, Shin-chan.
- Minato-san, stop it.

186
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,901
Why are you sulking?

187
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,089
- So you're ticklish, right?
- No, don't.

188
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,472
No, don't!

189
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,874
Stop. That's enough.

190
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:53,309
Got you!

191
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,853
Wow, Shin is a first class student.

192
00:11:58,455 --> 00:11:59,649
I wouldn't say that.

193
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:02,576
Anyway...

194
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,639
Can you really concentrate
in a place like this?

195
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,461
Yes.

196
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,058
It's much noisier back at home.

197
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,129
That's only natural for a big family.

198
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:15,485
Besides,

199
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,935
I have Minato-san by my side here.

200
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,060
Don't look in this direction.

201
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:26,478
All right.

202
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:28,211
Concentrate on your book.

203
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,979
Or I won't let you use this place.

204
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:32,315
Okay, Minato-san.

205
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:56,741
Hey.

206
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,343
Katsuki.

207
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:02,545
You don't live around here, do you?

208
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,448
Slow down, man.

209
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,650
What a coincidence.

210
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:08,985
Coming back from tutoring?

211
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:10,219
Or just hanging around?

212
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,022
That's unexpected
from the serious Katsuki-kun.

213
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,427
Katsuki.

214
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:19,996
Don't tell me you like guys.

215
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,238
The person you were chatting with

216
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,231
was obviously a guy.

217
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,505
So what?

218
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,008
So it's true.

219
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,401
Let me meet that Akira guy.

220
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:38,848
Why would I do that?

221
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,518
Wait, is he around here?

222
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,498
No? How about a picture?

223
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,155
Can't you mind your own business?

224
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,895
What a cold brat.

225
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:04,006
Hello.

226
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,408
Hey, Akira-kun.

227
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:07,610
The scallops the other day were amazing.

228
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,159
That's good to hear.

229
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:10,592
Grandma Uta.

230
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,512
Akira-kun, I'll go again tomorrow.

231
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,184
All right, I'll be waiting.

232
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:17,387
- I'll get going now.
- See you.

233
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:28,731
What's up, Shin?

234
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,911
I'm sorry, Minato-san.

235
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,136
I have a meeting today
so I won't be coming over.

236
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,706
Ah.

237
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,112
I see.

238
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,736
It's not like we planned to meet anyway.

239
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,911
I just don't want you to worry.

240
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,402
Thanks for calling.

241
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,417
Study hard, all right?

242
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:50,753
But not too hard, though.

243
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,127
Your health is the most important.

244
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,574
Health is the basis of everything.

245
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,438
I'm doing just fine.

246
00:14:57,713 --> 00:15:01,341
I'm more worried for your health
since you're nearly 30.

247
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,567
I'm doing completely fine. So don't worry.

248
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:08,610
I'm hanging up now.

249
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:09,786
Bye.

250
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,847
Gosh, that cocky brat.

251
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,855
I keep objecting.

252
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:25,988
But I could never really reject him.

253
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,027
I have Minato-san by my side here.

254
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:35,798
We are friends, no?

255
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,735
I keep thinking about nothing but Shin.

256
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,038
No, it doesn't mean anything.

257
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,708
Dammit.

258
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:54,929
Shin.

259
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,066
What is that?

260
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,341
This is so confusing.

261
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,264
Linking arms with a cute girl like that.

262
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,514
Could she be his girlfriend?

263
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:27,083
No, it can't be, but...

264
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:29,055
Hello, Minato-san.

265
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,153
Hello.

266
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,859
Were you lonely not seeing me yesterday?

267
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:40,930
I was.

268
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:47,740
Minato-san.

269
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:49,572
Hey, Minato-san.

270
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,821
Aren't you over-polishing it?

271
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:53,631
Shut up.

272
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:55,645
Yesterday...

273
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,281
you were flirting with a girl.

274
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,687
Flirting? I didn't...

275
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:00,950
I saw it with my own eyes.

276
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,952
A girl with her hair this long.

277
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,820
You were walking on the beach
with your arms linked.

278
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,823
- No, that's...
- Hello.

279
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:15,197
Sakurako? Why are you...

280
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:16,735
You are...

281
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:18,834
I'm Katsuki Sakurako.

282
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,469
Thank you for taking care of my brother.

283
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:23,927
Brother?

284
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm sorry, Minato-san.

285
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,064
This is my sister.

286
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:32,848
Oh boy, so...

287
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,324
I misunderstood. How embarrassing.

288
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:47,542
Nice to meet you, Sakurako-chan.

289
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:49,665
I'm Minato Akira.

290
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:53,102
Is this the person you like, Shin?

291
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,004
- Yes.
- Really?

292
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,539
What? Why did you...

293
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,207
Shin just told me

294
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:59,942
that he's found a guy he likes.

295
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:02,299
He said, if possible,
he wants to be with him forever.

296
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,814
Shin always does move fast.

297
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,882
But I guess I'm used
to him surprising me.

298
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:09,118
He even started cooking.

299
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:12,121
Am I disturbing you?

300
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:16,325
I just wanted to meet Shin's boyfriend
and see what you're like.

301
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,127
Boyfriend? No, it's not...

302
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:19,762
I'm happy for you, Shin.

303
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:22,031
Anyway, don't tell anyone else.

304
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:23,332
Okay. No worries.

305
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:24,634
Wait a minute.

306
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:28,533
Minato-san, I'm leaving Shin to you.

307
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:29,993
Bye.

308
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,544
Geez, you're so...

309
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:38,760
Sakurako-chan has the whole thing wrong.

310
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,849
I don't see it as a problem.

311
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:40,904
It is.

312
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,822
You and I are just friends.

313
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:47,089
Minato-san.

314
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,398
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

315
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,398
- No.
- So tell me.

316
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,738
Do you like me or hate me?

317
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:00,676
About that...

318
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,727
If you're asking whether I like or hate you.

319
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:07,798
Of course I like you.

320
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,380
Say "I like you, Shin."

321
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,417
If you say it it might become true.

322
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,675
- No way.
- Minato-san.

323
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:21,891
Say that you like me.

324
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:48,117
I won't say it no matter what.

325
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:49,585
Shin-chan.

326
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:55,854
Minato-san, you're nearly 30
but still going through a rebellious phase?

327
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:56,726
Lame.

328
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,860
Shut it, Shin.

329
00:19:57,884 --> 00:20:00,196
I'm almost 30,
and you're a high school student.

330
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:04,123
Use that smart brain of yours
and think about it.

331
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:11,107
So can I kiss you?

332
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:12,274
Are you crazy?

333
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,620
It's ten years too soon. No way.

334
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:17,213
In ten years I'll be 27.

335
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:19,094
Yeah, what a pure cute teenager.

336
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:20,249
Awesome.

337
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,351
Can I stay over in your room?

338
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,053
No, absolutely not.

339
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,956
Then can I massage your chest and hip?

340
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:29,892
Listen.

341
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,762
No matter what you say, no is no.

342
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:38,355
Then...

343
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
Hey!

344
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,998
Back off. Get off of me.

345
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:44,145
Just a little more.

346
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,208
That's enough.

347
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:48,277
Shin-chan.

348
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:50,975
Concentrate on studying. Be a good student.

349
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:54,316
All right, I'll study hard.

350
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,560
It wouldn't be good if you died
from your heart pounding too fast.

351
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,394
Thanks for your concern.

352
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,147
Dammit.

353
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,624
Lately Shin totally has me
wrapped around his finger.

354
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:38,227
You and I are just friends.

355
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,831
Say that you like me.

356
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,260
Hey!

357
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:48,137
Dammit.

358
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,692
He's just a high school kid.

359
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,020
Hi, Minato.

360
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:08,119
Hey, Takeda, what's up?

361
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:11,794
About that school reunion
I e-mailed you about a while back.

362
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,930
Oh, right.

363
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:16,932
The reunion party.

364
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:18,534
What's the matter with you?

365
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,303
You didn't came to any of the previous ones.
You gotta come this time.

366
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:24,340
All right. Got it. I'll go.

367
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:27,243
It's been such a long time
since everyone got together.

368
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:29,906
Sakuma-sensei is also coming.

369
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:41,757
What, don't you remember Sakuma-sensei?

370
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:42,791
Are you crazy?

371
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,393
How could anyone forget him?

372
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,328
Why are you so worked up?

373
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:48,397
I'm not.

374
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:51,133
Anyway, you gotta come this time.

375
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:18,994
No...

376
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,265
This is not good at all.

377
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:29,204
Minato's Laundromat

378
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,341
Due to the shop manager's condition,

379
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:35,311
we may be closed next week.

380
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,815
Thank you for your understanding.

381
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:46,782
Are you still not over him?

382
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:48,183
When I saw him,

383
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,719
I lost my heart.

384
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:51,619
Just get over him.

385
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:53,155
He's not going to date a high schooler.

386
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:55,179
I want to hold Minato Akira.

387
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,203
What I've felt for the last ten years.

388
00:24:57,227 --> 00:24:59,600
I can't date you.
Let's stop seeing each other.
