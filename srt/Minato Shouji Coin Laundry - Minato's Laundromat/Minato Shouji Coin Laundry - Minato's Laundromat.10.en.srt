1
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:01,635
What's going on?

2
00:00:01,948 --> 00:00:04,404
I really don't know what to do.

3
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:10,475
Shuu-kun.

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,070
Uh...

5
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:16,709
Did you see that?

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,741
See what?

7
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:19,377
If you didn't, then it's nothing.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,453
I did.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,423
You were hugging each other as if you're about to kiss.

10
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,291
- It's not like that.
- It's not like that.

11
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,828
It's nothing. It was just...

12
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:38,366
Did you just ignore it?

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,410
Jeez, Shuu-kun.

14
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,687
Come here.

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,179
What the heck?

16
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,467
What just happened?

17
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,402
Your timing is gettin better.

18
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:58,781
With this rate,

19
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,961
victory won't be just a dream.

20
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:04,775
Keep it up, Guys!

23
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,610
Are you all right now?

24
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:19,324
Thanks to you all, I'm fine now.

25
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,492
My checkup result came out just normal.

26
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:22,894
So I've been discharged.

27
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:25,516
That's great to hear.

28
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,250
Sensei.

29
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,944
I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up at the hospital.

30
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,672
That's alright.

31
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:33,792
Actually...

32
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:35,817
Shintaro-kun came to pick me up.

33
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,116
Shin?

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,550
He also visited me every day
during my stay at the hospital.

35
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,634
He also said he wanted to be rooting for you.

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,675
Shin.

37
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:23,505
(You're almost 30.
Don't overdo things, all right?)

38
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,313
You're almost 30.
Don't overdo things, all right?

39
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:38,821

What's the matter?

46
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,783
Well, Shuu-kun.

47
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,447
How about we...

48
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,106
start dating again?

49
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,705
Why?

50
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,726
Why?

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,161
We're in Japan.

52
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,061
We don't need to pretend to be dating.

53
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:26,166
No, that's not what I meant to say.

54
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,234
So what is it?

55
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,306

59
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:51,979
have much free time?

60
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,807
If you have too much free time
to fool around,

61
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:57,979
you might as well spend it on studying.

Why can't you understand me?

63
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,306

74
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:46,673
Oh.

75
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,313
It's a cut...

76
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:49,942
I got from some sewing.

77
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:54,048
That's...

78
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,438
It's an amulet.

79
00:05:56,821 --> 00:06:00,227
I want to give it to everyone
in the swimming club before the race.

80
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,626
But...

81
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,278
this is embarrassing.

82
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,677
I'm not good at sewing at all.

83
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,166
May I borrow it for a bit?

84
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:20,930
Sure.

85
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:29,225
Wow, awesome.

86
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,825
You're amazing.

87
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,329
No.

88
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,731
Not really that good.

89
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,779
You have been really helpful lately.

90
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:40,678
I just...

91
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,830
want to be helpful to Minato-san.
Even if it's a tiny thing.

92
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:48,352
You really love and care about Akira-kun.

93
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,081
What about you? How do you feel?

94
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,790
No.

95
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,094
I mean...

96
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:04,164
I just wonder what Minato-san was like.

97
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,962
What kind of student was he?

98
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:07,394
I see.

99
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,318
Well,

100
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:15,445
when I first came to work in this school,

101
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,938
he was quite a rebellious kid.

102
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:19,610
Rebellious?

103
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,374
He always had the trendiest hairstyles.

104
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:26,932
He sometimes smoked in some secret corner.

105
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,772
However...

106
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,075
after joining the swimming club,
he slowly opened up his mind.

107
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:33,782
In his final year,

108
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,167
he served as a captain of the club.

109
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:37,616
But shortly before the competition,

110
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
he had this knee ligament injury.

111
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:41,274
But...

112
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:42,703
despite that,

113
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,787
he really tried his best.

114
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,335
He's a student I'm very proud of.

115
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:49,869
That's Akira-kun.

116
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,038
Thank you very much.

117
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,576
You gave me so much advice on Shuu-Sensei.

118
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:04,451
Even if the result was heartbreaking.

119
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,519
But after revealing all my feelings,

120
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:07,587
I felt relieved.

121
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:09,657
I see.

122
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,890
Anyway, you're really amazing, Sakurako-chan.

123
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,822
And Shin, too.

124
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,203
It would be nice if I could speak my mind.

125
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:29,296
I'm sorry, Sakurako-chan.

126
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:32,625
I've been hiding it from you.

127
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,657
Actually,

128
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:40,184
I also have a crush on Shuu-kun.

129
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,827
Shuu-kun has always been a weird kinda guy.

130
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,227
At first,

131
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:53,145
I thought here he is. This guy is so wacky.

132
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,024
But then...

133
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:58,271
there was this one time when he got so mad at me.

134
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:01,708
One Mebistar Menthol, please.

135
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:13,860
What's that?

136
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:16,602
A lollipop.

137
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:18,658
But, it's not what I want.

138
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,682
I want a box of cigarettes.

139
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:22,259
I don't sell it to kids.

140
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,219
It's all right.

141
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:25,860
I won't tell anyone if you do.

142
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,748
Please.

143
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,876
Just this once.

144
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:31,243
Sorry.

145
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:32,658
Why not?

146
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:34,718
It has nothing to do with you.

147
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:39,017
You should value your health more.

148
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:48,063
Come on.

149
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,245
You look better with something like this.

150
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,220
I never understood what's on his mind.

151
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,170
But gradually, I started to get interested in him.

152
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:00,100
Shuu-kun.

153
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,141
Going somewhere?

154
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,063
I'm traveling the world.

155
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:14,836
I want to see all of the magnificent architecture
around the world with these eyes.

156
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,372
And learn about it.

157
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:21,152
Since then, I wanted
to get to know him even more.

158
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,316
I'll come with you.

159
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,927
So that summer vacation,

160
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:29,758
I followed him overseas.

161
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:32,811
His eyes sparkled

162
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,568
when he looked at those buildings.

163
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:37,570
I found that side of Shuu-kun

164
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,496
was so cool.

165
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:45,918
Asuka-san.

166
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,681
I totally understand that feeling.

167
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,348
You're right.

168
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:54,319
Shuu-Sensei is really a strange person.

169
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,455
But it's just that...

170
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,857
his spirit of pure curiosity knows no bounds.

171
00:10:58,303 --> 00:11:01,875
I find holding on to something
you like so much very charming.

172
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:04,519
That's true.

173
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,300
Be honest with yourself. That's the spirit.

174
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,701
But he can be super sluggish too.

175
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,394
So you call that cute or unacceptable?

176
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,841
Sometimes he wears his t-shirt inside out.

177
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:17,098
And do you know he really likes cats?

178
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,549
You seem to really like him.

179
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:23,883
I mean Shuu-Sensei.

180
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,953
You gotta tell him of

181
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,426
your true feelings.

182
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,244
Minato-san.

183
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:41,627
Welcome back.

184
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,234
You're working hard, huh?

185
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:47,619
You too...

186
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:49,706
you seem to be doing your best to train the club.

187
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,513
The competition is day after tomorrow.

188
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:57,517
So my duty as a coach

189
00:11:58,298 --> 00:11:59,854
only lasts until tomorrow.

190
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,072
Thank you.

191
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:12,527
For the food and everything else.

192
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,615
About Sakuma-Sensei...

193
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,760
Don't worry about that.

194
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,108
I have decided to root for you.

195
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:26,565
Shin.

196
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,057
Are you sure...

197
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:32,104
you aren't...

198
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:35,580
forcing yourself?

199
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,018
I mean...

200
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:43,016
I shouldn't say this, but...

201
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:48,096
I'm actually very jealous.

202
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:56,171
Can't you choose me instead?

203
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:58,986
What...

204
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:00,534
I'm kidding.

205
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:02,515
You're totally gullible.

206
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:03,616
Minato-san.

207
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Don't bully the grown-up, you idiot.

208
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,322
Seeing you and Sakuma-Sensesi together

209
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:16,029
was a pain for me.

210
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,119
Sakuma-Sensei...

211
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:22,083
knows a lot about you that I don't.

212
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,049
But...

213
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,291
what's more important is that...

214
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,091
I want you to be able to smile.

215
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,149
I don't want to see you...

216
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,885
cry again.

217
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:53,666
I have to go home and make dinner.

218
00:13:58,372 --> 00:13:59,455
Shin.

219
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,229
Hang on.

220
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:06,563
This...

221
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:08,039
(Tokyo Eiwa University, Faculty of Medicine)

222
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,080
Is it yours?

223
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:11,838
Yes.

224
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,289
So you're...

225
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,258
going to Tokyo?

226
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:22,501
About that...

227
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:26,361
I'm still thinking.

228
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,371
Is that right?

229
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:32,872
If I'm not here,

230
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,178
will you be lonely?

231
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:38,807
Are you crazy?

232
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:40,205
For me,

233
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,051
no matter where you are,

234
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,400
I will always support you.

235
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,432
I got it.

236
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,400
I'll try my best.

237
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,893
I hope you do too.

238
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,322
You gotta tell him.

239
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,493
Tell Sakuma-Sensei how you feel.

240
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:28,967
Sensei.

241
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:31,567
- Thank you for the amulet.
- Thank you very much.

242
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:35,070
Akira-san, I'll try my best tomorrow.

243
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,639
- You can do it.
- We can do it.

244
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,729
Sensei.

245
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,148
It's finally approaching.

246
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,463
Yes.

247
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:03,574
Oh, right.

248
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,432
Here.

249
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,668
I made it for you too.

250
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,557
Thank you very much.

251
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:12,672
So you made it yourself?

252
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:13,783
Yes.

253
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:15,361
But...

254
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,391
Shintaro-kun helped me with this piece.

255
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:22,939
Akira-kun.

256
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:25,825
You have been a great coach to the kids
until the last day.

257
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:27,687
Thank you very much.

258
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:31,324
Having you here with us,

259
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:32,781
for everyone

260
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:34,160
and for me,

261
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:36,229
has been a very meaningful support.

262
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:39,539
All right.

263
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,009
It's an important day tomorrow.

264
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,239
Let's go home.

265
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,672
Sensei.

266
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,283
Yes?

267
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,527
On the graduation day

268
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,055
ten years ago,

269
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,135
I suddenly kissed you

270
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:17,174
and ran away.

271
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:21,908
I'd like to apologize for that.

272
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,647
I, at that time...

273
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,806
was a total useless idiot.

274
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,902
You always supported me

275
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:40,846
when my knee was injured

276
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,475
that I couldn't swim anymore.

277
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:47,411
And when I thought...

278
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:50,541
I was alone in this world too.

279
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,011
Because of you,

280
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,403
I managed to get through those hard times.

281
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,390
I...

282
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,726
back then...

283
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,421
My thought about you...

284
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,329
My feelings for you...

285
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,662
was real.

286
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:18,906
I really...

287
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:20,713
liked you.

288
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,468
Akira-kun.

289
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,921
Thank you.

290
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,531
You...

291
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,211
at that time

292
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:51,788
and even now...

293
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,785
are my precious student.

294
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,757
And I...

295
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:02,381
am truly proud

296
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:06,032
to be your teacher.

297
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:10,743
Sensei.

298
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:23,432
It's like going back in time
and getting rejected.

299
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:34,671
However...

300
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:39,242
it feels good to be able to say it out loud.

301
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,716
From now on, I...

302
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,523
will keep praying

303
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,566
for you to live the life you desire

304
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,122
and live happily

305
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:53,040
ever after.

306
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:00,328
Thank you very much

307
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,002
for your kind affection.

308
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,075
Sensei.

309
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,246
Thank you very much.

310
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,309
By the way...

311
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:33,238
your kiss was actually very passionate.

312
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:37,770
Please forget about it.

313
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,532
All right.

314
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:41,608
Let's go.

315
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:45,340
Come on.

316
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,488
Let's go.

317
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,890
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

318
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:23,936
Hello.

319
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:25,381
Minato-san.

320
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,381
Yes.

321
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,526
Have you talked to him?

322
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:39,366
Yes, I did.

323
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,202
Minato-san.

324
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,208
Can I come over to see you now?

325
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:52,390
What?

326
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:55,866
What are you talking about?

327
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,684
Come to see me now?

328
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,634
Where are you?

329
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,420
Shin.

330
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:24,313
Why are you here?

331
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:27,319
Because...

332
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,449
I don't want you...

333
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,320
to cry alone like in the past.

334
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,457
What's with you?

335
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,495
I'm not...

336
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:45,783
crying.

337
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:50,197
I'm not crying at all.

338
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,289
It must have been hard for you.

339
00:22:58,637 --> 00:22:59,686
Minato-san.

340
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:06,557
It's all right.

341
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,053
I'll be by your side

342
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:13,520
until you don't cry anymore.

343
00:24:45,131 --> 00:24:45,370
(Next Episode)

344
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:46,685
(On a date in Tokyo)
Come on, let's go.

345
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,387
Our date is starting now.

346
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:49,688
Let's travel again.

347
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,712
