Excuse me.

Yes?

7
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:28,752
There's something on your back.

8
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:37,516
I see.

9
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,395
Yesterday, my niece came to visit me.

10
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:44,359
She draws well, doesn't she?

11
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,626
All right then. Let's check the attendance.

is on a three-day-two-night trip

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
to heal his heart.

Hello.

25
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:36,022
It's been a long time, Akira-kun.

At the time,

27

00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,760
Uh, I...

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,485

I'm such a loser.

34
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,220
Minato-san, are you alright?

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,720
Aren't you feeling well?
Are you at home now?

36

39
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,490
still like him?

Shin.

51

That's too rude of you.

52

I'm sorry, Takayuki-san.

Tell me.
What's between Akira-san and Takayuki-san?

It has nothing to do with you.

Come on, just tell me.

57
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,280

64
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:02,574
done it with Shin?

I already told you.

69

Shin and I aren't dating.

70
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,453
So Shin's love is still unrequited.

Hey, Akira-san.

You can be quite frivolous
but you're a good guy.

If you sincerely confess your love,

83
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:11,752

A trip?

It's good to take a break
once in a while, right?

102

Come on.

108
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,524
So even that can't cheer you up?

109
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,102
Well, it can't be helped then.

110
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,383
Alright.

111
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:55,180
I'll treat you
to a watermelon shake the next time.

112

Watermelon shake?

113
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:58,866
That's right.

114
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,735
Back in high school, I always had it
on the way back from the club.

115
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,960
It's good, you know.

116
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,871
Let's have it together next time.

117
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,442
Together?

118

Yes, together.

119
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,327
Yes. Definitely a yes.

120
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:17,928
I'll hold you to that, Minato-san.

121
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,386
Sure.

122
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,934
I promise.

123
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,169
So it's a date.

124
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,509
No, it's not.

125
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,492

whoever that person is...

131

I won't be giving up.

135
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,386
he's so straightforward,

136
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:36,964
But...

137
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:40,878
nothing has changed for me at all.

138
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,519
Damn it.

139
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,944
How much longer am I going to hesitate?

140
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,692
Damn it.

141
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,637
It's time I have to...

142
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,310
(Sakuma Store)

143
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,202
Finally...

144
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,435
I'm here.

145
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,882
Hello.

146
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,890
Could this be...

147
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:26,483
Sensei's nephew?

148
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:28,149
Shuu-kun, right?

149
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,564
You startled me.

150
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,530
I heard you went abroad for a while.

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,830
Are you already back?

152
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:38,304
Want cigarettes?

153
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:41,014
Uh...

154
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,100
I quit smoking.

155
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:44,983
Sakuma-sensei...

156
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:46,760
No, I mean...

157
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,848
Where's Takayuki-sensei?

158
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,835
Takayuki lives by himself now.

159
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,819
All right.

160
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,072
Thank you.

161
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,330
(Takayuki)

162
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:21,619
If I'm to visit him at his personal residence,
it seems a bit...

163
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,840
By the way...

164
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,128
what am I to say when I meet him?

165
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:40,062
(Katsuki)
You know the new teacher

166
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,830
at the tutorial school is so cool.

167
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,980
He's so quiet and aloof
that you can't tell what he's thinking.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,942
But he is even cooler that way.

169
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,767
Hey, Shin.

170
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,587
Sorry, what?

171
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,385
By the way,

172
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:01,721
aren't you making too many of it?

173
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:11,685
Shin.

174
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:14,435
You were supposed to return home by now.

175
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:17,601
I've brought you some fried mackerel

176
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,410
to thank you for the gift.

177
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,771
You didn't have to.

178
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,756
Anyway,

179
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,382
thanks.

180
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,001
Should we eat it together?

181
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,890
(Bean Sprout)

182
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,334
Where have you been today?

183
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:10,980
Are you all right?

184
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,225
Yes.

185
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,020
You dropped something.

186
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,842
Hey, that's...

187
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,281
Takayuki...

188
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,236
This is...

189
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,486
Sakuma-sensei's address.

190
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:35,897
Well...

191
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,670
actually...

192
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:42,201
I was thinking of meeting Sakuma-sensei.

193
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,158
So I went to his shop.

194
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,094
But I didn't find him there.

195
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,673
It turns out he lives by himself now.

196
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,606
Are you going to meet him?

197
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,341
Well...

198
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:10,763
Just go.

199
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,519
It's all right.

200
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,588
If something were to ever happen to you,

201
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,729
I'll come and find you immediately.

202
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:24,163
You're always exaggerating it.

203
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,589
All right.

204
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:28,904
It's not because you told me to.

205
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,214
But I need to settle things once and for all.

206
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,272
I'm going to meet him.

207
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,312
Thank you.

208
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:45,631
Even when I said it like that...

209
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,655
but when I finally arrived at his place,

210
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,390
I felt so nervous that my stomach started hurting.

211
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:59,194
I'm sorry, Shin. I don't feel good at all.

212
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,063
I should back off for today.

213
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:02,636
Akira-kun.

214
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:13,253
Please, have a drink.

215
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm sorry for coming over so suddenly.

216
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,860
No problem. I'm glad you came.

217
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,393
Are you all right?

218
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:28,860
I'm all right.

219
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,482
Just a little choke.

220
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,440
Sensei.

221
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,625
You haven't changed one bit.

222
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:40,661
Oh, right.

223
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,662
I have something to show you too.

224
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,679
If I'm not mistaken,
it should be somewhere here.

225
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,048
Oh, I found it.

226
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,777
Here.

227
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,269
While you were still in tenth grade,

228
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,026
and I was just hired to teach
at Keyaki High School.

229
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,994
No.

230
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,230
I was so young back then...

231
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,531
It suited you though.

232
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,040
Even if it was against the school rules.

233
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,906
I, at the time,...

234
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,942
was still young...

235
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:17,941
I was still a teenager.

236
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,146
Hey, Yamaguchi from class A is so cute.

237
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:21,405
I know. She's super cute.

238
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:22,597
Don't you think so, Akira?

239
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,128
Yes.

240
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,529
Right? She's the cutest ever.

241
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,207
I was good for nothing.

242
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:33,249
I was reckless.

243
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,862
Hello, Akira-kun.

244
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:46,935
Do you remember me?

245
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,629
I'm Sakuma Takayuki from Sakuma Store.

246
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,043
Sakuma Store?

247
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:55,123
When you were little,
I was often asked to babysit you.

248
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:57,623
We played together all the time.

249
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,599
I don't remember such a thing.

250
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,183
Hey.

251
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:18,027
Are you all right?

252
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,876
Yes, but barely.

253
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,809
Akira-kun.

254
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,324
Yes?

255
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,920
(Club Application)

256
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,678
Would you like to join the swimming club?

257
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,989
Sakuma-sensei...

258
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:40,940
helped pull me up to the light.

259
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,367
Sensei.

260
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:52,503
Well...

261
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:55,508
I...

262
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:03,829
What should I do?

263
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,718
What's the matter?

264
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,555
Shin. You're here.

265
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,293
Have you met Sakuma-sensei?

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,797
Yes, I met him.

267
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,560
Have you talked?

268
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,657
About that...

269
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,320
Sensei.

270
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:33,458
Well...

271
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,759
I...

272
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:38,337
like...

273
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,320
I like...

274
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,760
Hmm?

275
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,800
I...

276
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,000
You like?

277
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,220
Uh, well...

278
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:54,417
I like...

279
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:56,792
You like? I see.

280
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,378
You like watermelon.

281
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,521
No, it's not that.

282
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,650
- Like...
- Like...

283
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,760
You like...

284
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,780
This is hard.

285
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,590
- I like...
- You like...

286
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,770
I know.

287
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,420
Swimming club.

288
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,540
Actually, I'd like to ask you
about that as well.

289
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:19,914
Akira-kun.

290
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,950
Would you like to join the swimming club?

291
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,120
What?

292
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,850
As the swimming club coach?

293
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,070
Yes.

294
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,656
Did you say yes?

295
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,540
Yes.

296
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,699
I thought you were to going to
settle things with him.

297
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,970
It seems like an important period
as the tournament is near.

298
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,460
He insisted that I should help him.

299
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,610
It can't be helped.

300
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,695
So you're happy that he asked you for help.

301
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,086
Let alone settling things with him.

302
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,365
You came back
without telling him how you feel.

303
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,606
Am I right?

304
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,934
It can't be helped.

305
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,930
But my past and being a coach
are two different things.

306
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,610
What about sensei?

307
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,274
Shut up already.

308
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:10,276
I can't understand myself either.

309
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,144
When you're an adult,

310
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,640
there are things you can't decide
whether it's black or white.

311
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,250
Oh, right.

312
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:22,462
I'm washing my bed sheet.

313
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:28,388
It smells so good.

314
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,230
Here, you can try sniffing it.

315
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,732
It smells so nice.

316
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,300
You really can't stay still.

317
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,140
Are you really an adult?

318
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,171
Sorry.

319
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,800
No, no, no.

320
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,976
Not like this.

321
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,440
You can't do this.

322
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,230
You're right.

323
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,050
It smells so nice.

324
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,353
Hey.

325
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:28,587
Stay still.

326
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,708
I'm just sniffing the linen.

327
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,820
What?

328
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,968
Don't sniff it like this.

329
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:49,074
You rascal.

330
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,290
Stop it.

331
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,830
I'm just feeling the sheet.

332
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,800
Please.

333
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,430
Please stop.

334
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,070
No, don't go further.

335
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,491
What's with that scream?

336
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:15,420
Thanks to you, now I have to wash it again.

337
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,675
Shin, you silly punk.

338
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,305
You crazy, handsome punk.

339
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,679
I'm sorry, Minato-san.

340
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,296
Can I borrow it?

341
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,310
Come on.

342
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,765
I'll be waiting.

343
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,380
Make sure you settle things with him.

344
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:41,936
I know.

345
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,286
Even the toughest of bedsheets,

346
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:46,770
can be taken care of, over at
Minato's Laundromat.

347
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,710
Yaho.

348
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,624
(Sakuma Store)

349
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:58,772
So you're back.

350
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,374
Asuka.

351
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,730
Being wrapped in gentle and soft touch...

352
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,420
Katsuki.

353
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,083
I need to talk to you about something.

354
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,158
Is definitely a bright morning welcome.

355
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Welcome.

356
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,500
It's been a while, Akira-kun.

357
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,700
Saki.

358
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,990
Please continue to support us next week.

359
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,510
(Next Episode)
Can you give me some advice?

360
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:47,675
(New love rival)
What are you doing?

361
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,040
(New love rival)
What is it you want to talk about?

362
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,789
(The meeting of the past and future)
I see, you still can't figure

363
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:52,096
what's on one's mind.

364
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,451
I hope I get to see Shuu-sensei tomorrow.

365
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,350
What's the reason
you don't want to leave your hometown?

366
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,750
(This drama is fictional)
Please tell me the truth.
