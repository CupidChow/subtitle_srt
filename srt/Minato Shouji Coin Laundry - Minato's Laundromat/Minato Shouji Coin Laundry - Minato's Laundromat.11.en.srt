1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,541
All right.

2
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:09,499
As good as new.

3
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,547
Akira-san.

4
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,082
What should I do?

5
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:17,150
Asuka, are you still here?

6
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,365
Don't you have to prepare for the exam?

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,492
It's not the time to do something like that.

8
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:24,396
Not the time to do that?
Aren't you in your senior year?

9
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:25,916
It's all right.

10
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:28,629
I've decided to take over the fish shop.

11
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:30,880
Really?

12
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:32,821
Are you going to take over?

13
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,135
Wow.

14
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:36,641
Your father must be thrilled.

15
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,665
But what if...

16
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,165
I don't become a fish seller,

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,845
but a cat instead?

18
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,018
To become a cat...

19
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:53,395
and stay by the side of my loved one

20
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:55,343
and let him love and cherish me.

21
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:59,693
I would be extremely happy.

22
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:01,885
What's with you, Asuka?

23
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:04,924
So you have someone you really like?

24
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:09,888
Minato-san.

25
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:13,045
What are you talking
so passionately with Hanabusa?

26
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:14,420
Hey, Shin.

27
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:18,211
How could you see this as a passionate talk?

28
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,815
Anyone staying near you in a two-meter radius

29
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,694
is considered flirting with you.

30
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,225
And of course, except me.

31
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,322
All right.

32
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:39,092
You're such a fussy guy
with a handsome face.

33
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,304
How nice.

34
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,139
You guys seem so happy.

35
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:50,765
Hey, Asuka.

36
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:52,991
You're getting it all wrong.

37
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,737
Shin and I aren't in a relationship.

38
00:01:57,222 --> 00:01:58,239
Right, Shin?

39
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:03,390
Don't make a face that confuses people.

40
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:09,391
Minato-san, I have a favor to ask.

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,716
Next week,

42
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,575
(Tokyo Eiwa University, Faculty of Medicine)
I'm going to an open house in Tokyo.

43
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,354
Can you be my guide?

44
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:21,810
Your guide?

45
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,075
Yes.

46
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:25,545
I hardly know a thing about Tokyo.
I haven't been there often.

47
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:27,686
Is that right?

48
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,751
Well,

49
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,235
you've helped me in many ways.

50
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:35,453
So I'll be your guide in Tokyo

51
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,743
and take you to eat delicious food.

52
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:39,715
Thank you very much.

53
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,800
"Minato's Laundromat."

54
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:50,130
Oh, boy.

55
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:53,788
It took a long time to get here by the bus.

56
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,589
Minato-san, is your waist all right?

57
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,772
Oh, yeah.

58
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:01,837
I've started to feel it at my waist.

59
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,140
Please don't worry.

60
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:05,758
If anything happens,

61
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:07,904
you can ride on my back anytime.

62
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,584
Thank you, Shin.

63
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:13,250
That way, I can welcome my old age with ease.

64
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,283
Are you kidding me?

65
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,673
Tokyo is like a different world.

66
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:21,809
I'm so excited.

67
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,906
Hey, Asuka.

68
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:26,301
Are you sure you're here
to check on fish shops?

69
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:27,953
Of course.

70
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,440
So from here, let's go separate ways.

71
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:33,227
I'm going to walk around here.

72
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:34,859
Bye.

73
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:36,703
Hey!

74
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:39,094
Make sure to come back in time for the bus.

75
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,827
Asuka, this punk.

76
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:45,883
I guess he just wants to come to Tokyo.

77
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,023
And he made me pay for the bus fare.

78
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:54,401
I think this is good.

79
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,124
So we can be alone.

80
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:58,695
Let's go.

81
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,873
Yeah.

82
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:03,593
Sure.

83
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,553
So we're alone now.

84
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,834
Wait a minute.

85
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:18,883
Hanging out with Shin alone,
does this means...

86
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:29,015
Asuka, what's up?

87
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,552
Shuu-kun, do you know where I am right now?

88
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:36,968
Berwick Hall.

89
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:39,397
Asuka, are you in Yokohama?

90
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,846
That's right.

91
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:42,509
You know, Berwick Hall...

92
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,811
was designed by J. Hill Morgan.

93
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,439
Over the chimney, there are tiles on top.

94
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:49,506
Can you see it?

95
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,483
Oh, yes.

96
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,982
Let me see it.

97
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,459
Oh, right.

98
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:57,590
Erismante should be nearby too.

99
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,145
Asuka, I want to see it too.

100
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,327
Got it.

101
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,295
You just need to be patient, Shuu-kun.

102
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:07,369
All right, the campus tour is starting now.

103
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:08,501
Please follow me.

104
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,205
Shin, wait.

105
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,208
You can go ahead.

106
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,505
I'll wait here.

107
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:17,685
Why?

108
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,312
Well...

109
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,416
You know, for an uncle to walk
among high school kids like this...

110
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:25,678
If you're nervous,

111
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,283
you can hold my hand.

112
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:29,760
Are you crazy?

113
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:31,621
Do you know what you just said?

114
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,791
Go on.

115
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,252
Don't blame me if you've lost the crowd.

116
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,568
This lab

117
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,447
will be used for genomic medicine.

118
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,425
Genomic medicine is to investigate
and analyze our genes

119
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,844
and bring the results
to increase the efficiency...

120
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,112
Shin will soon be a university student.

121
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,514
So you're...

122
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:56,082
going to Tokyo.

123
00:06:58,165 --> 00:06:59,219
About that...

124
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,056
I'm still thinking.

125
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:04,925
If I'm not here,

126
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,099
will you be lonely?

127
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:20,194
So, for him to continue walking on his path,

128
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:23,658
I'll do my best to push him forward.

129
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,379
Ta-da.

130
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,379
Belgian Waffle.

131
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:31,952
We ate it often back in Belgium.

132
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:35,293
We ate it a lot
while looking at those architectures.

133
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:37,724
That's true.

134
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,776
This reminds me of those old days.

135
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,130
Let's travel together again.

136
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:45,604
Yeah.

137
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,913
I won't be bored if I go with you.

138
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:53,707
But I don't know when.

139
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,834
It could be years from now.

140
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:58,202
That long?

141
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,312
How was it?

142
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,266
It lives up to the name
of a state-of-the-art research university.

143
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:08,021
Their joint research with foreign countries
is very interesting.

144
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,210
Is that right?

145
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,553
It'll be nice if you can study here.

146
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,015
I mean...

147
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm sure you can get in.

148
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,922
It's going to be hard but keep trying.

149
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:21,421
I will.

150
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:24,562
Minato-san.

151
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,712
Are you taking me around Tokyo now?

152
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,312
Yes.

153
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,776
So let's go.

154
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:33,694
Our date is starting now.

155
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,421
Who said this is a date?

156
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,388
Is that Tokyo Tower?

157
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:43,089
Yes, that's right.

158
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:44,468
Ready?

159
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:45,905
One, two.

160
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:47,260
Let's take a photo together.

161
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,490
Okay, smile.

162
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,564
Okay, smile.

163
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:53,959
Let's do this and eat.

164
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,732
To prove our relationship.

165
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,684
Come on. We don't need
to take a photo with this.

166
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,569
What's wrong with it?
It's quite popular here.

167
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,148
How about I take a photo of you?

168
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,218
Yes, please.

169
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:10,683
Mister on the right, can you smile a little?

170
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,486
Yes, that's nice.

171
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,688
Ready? Smile.

172
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:17,874
Love each other a lot.

173
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:27,734
This place is famous
for making educational wishes.

174
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:29,740
Let's make a wish together.

175
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:31,632
Yes.

176
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,730
(Good luck charm)

177
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,374
Please accept this.

178
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,182
Thank you.

179
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:46,483
Here.

180
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,124
(Passed the exam)
This way, you'll pass the exam for sure.

181
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,935
Thank you very much, Minato-san.

182
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:06,370
Shin.

183
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:08,908
Have you seen Asuka?

184
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:09,983
Not at all.

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,162
I've looked everywhere,
but he's nowhere to be found.

186
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:14,080
I can't reach him on the phone, either.

187
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:18,613
What if something happened to him?

188
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,406
I'm sorry, Akira-san.

189
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:28,528
Asuka.

190
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,760
Are you all right?

191
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,582
Minato-san was so worried about you.

192
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:44,940
Trust me. I feel equally bad about this.

193
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:46,713
You know...

194
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,421
he was running around looking for you.

195
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,597
He might have lost three kilograms today.

196
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,622
I said I got it.

197
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:55,522
It was hard enough losing my phone.

198
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:03,096
The earliest bus will be at seven tomorrow.

199
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,557
The last train we could take
has already left.

200
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,016
So what should we do?

201
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,375
What else can we do?

202
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,373
(Edokoma Ryokan)

203
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,091
This room is too small.

204
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,733
Akira-san. Are you an innocent teen or what?

205
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:41,868
Shut up.

206
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:43,870
An adult like me

207
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,638
has a duty to guide

208
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:49,275
the youngsters like you to do what's right.

209
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,857
Minato-san.

210
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:53,148
Please take off your underwear.

211
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,189
Why?

212
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:58,351
I'll wash it for you.

213
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,854
Just underwear. I can buy a new one here.

214
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:03,765
I'm going to a convenience store.

215
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:06,369
You guys go take a shower and go to bed.

216
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:13,564
Oh, boy.

217
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,836
Do I have to stay in the same room with them?

218
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:22,976
Why is there only one room left?

219
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,854
Is this the way...

220
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:38,992
to the convenience store?

221
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,867
I can never get used

222
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,435
to a dark place like this.

223
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,499
Minato-san.

224
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:08,988
Shin.

225
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:11,180
Why are you here?

226
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:12,956
I'm worried about you.

227
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,861
I thought...

228
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:16,753
you might be lost
and got so scared and cried.

229
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,661
I wasn't crying.

230
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,601
Anyway...

231
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,903
since you are here,

232
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,275
we can just go together.

233
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,765
Let's go, then.

234
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,953
If we hold hands, you won't be scared.

235
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:36,892
I said I wasn't scared.

236
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,162
It will be bad if you get lost.

237
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,235
I'll hold on to you.

238
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:05,778
Shin, you walk this way.

239
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,353
What's with you?

240
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:20,193
Why is Asuka sleeping there?

241
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,437
Minato-san.

242
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:27,679
Would you like to take a shower first?

243
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,367
Oh.

244
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:32,939
You go ahead.

245
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:34,687
Take a shower first.

246
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:38,711
What's with that smile?

247
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:40,921
This feels like...

248
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,116
a newly-married couple.

249
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,921
I'll go take a shower, then.

250
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,195
It's not good.

251
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,431
This way,

252
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,291
things will just go as he wants.

253
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,337
Asuka.

254
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,505
Wake up.

255
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,606
Wake up.

256
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,847
What's with you? You told me
to go to bed, now you're waking me up?

257
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,648
If you weren't here,
something would have happened.

258
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:14,981
Come on. What's so wrong with that?

259
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,617
It's okay to cross the line.

260
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,720
I'll sleep now.

261
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,234
I'm so tired.

262
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:23,351
Asuka.

263
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:30,828
Minato-san.

264
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,187
What is it?

265
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,203
I forgot the towel.

266
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,238
Can you give it to me?

267
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,351
Hey.

268
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,734
I have a towel here.

269
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:56,663
Minato-san.

270
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,140
It feels so good to take a shower.

271
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,671
Shall we take it together?

272
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:03,262
Are you out of your mind?

273
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:05,499
You'll catch a cold.

274
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:07,531
Look.

275
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,769
It's so warm.

276
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,421
I won't catch a cold.

277
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,953
All right.

278
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,208
Just take it.

279
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:16,932
And dry yourself.

280
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,854
Minato-san, thank you very much.

281
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:35,164
Shin.

282
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:37,830
Tonight,

283
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:40,757
I won't be making any eye contact with you.

284
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:44,437
Why not?

285
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,281
For Minato Akira

286
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,380
to still be Minato Akira.

287
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,845
Thank you for falling asleep.

288
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:43,717
Can't you sleep?

289
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,632
What? Are you still awake?

290
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,202
A moment ago,

291
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,759
you were looking at me.

292
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,928
You said you wouldn't make eye contact with me.

293
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,288
I didn't.

294
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,514
You closed your eyes. Our eyes didn't meet.

295
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,272
I can't sleep either.

296
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,590
Knowing you were by my side.

297
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,186
Can I...

298
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,498
hold your hands?

299
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,975
We don't need to make eye contact.

300
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,022
Just holding hands is enough.

301
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,309
That way,

302
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:33,608
I think I can sleep.

303
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,026
All right, I get it.

304
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,090
Just holding hands. That's all.

305
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,241
Your hand...

306
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,170
is so warm.

307
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,684
For a warm-hearted person,

308
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:14,006
their hands are usually warm.

309
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:21,727
Are you all right now?

310
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:25,889
What do you mean?

311
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,061
I mean, Sakuma-sensei.

312
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,157
It's good to have you here.

313
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,716
But it's so embarrassing

314
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:48,528
for an old man like me
to cry in front of a highschooler.

315
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,026
I don't think it's anything embarrassing.

316
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,538
I find you being like this

317
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,933
is kind of cute.

318
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,272
But...

319
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,467
I can't help wonder.
I like you so much.

320
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,945
But why can't I be the person

321
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,781
that you like?

322
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,108
Anyway,

323
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:26,586
holding your hand like this...

324
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:30,889
already makes me happy.

325
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:37,444
Just this little instance...

326
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:41,311
could make me so happy.

327
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,522
Minato-san.

328
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,918
Thank you very much

329
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,354
for coming here with me.

330
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,006
Good night.

331
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:04,467
Yeah.

332
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:06,990
Good night.

333
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:16,909
Shin's feelings,

334
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:20,980
his thoughts

335
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,494
have passed through his hand.

336
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,640
I can feel it that it hurts.

337
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,849
We're back.

338
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:50,935
Tokyo was nice.

339
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,491
But I like our hometown better.

340
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:56,794
Akira-san.

341
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,871
Thank you for taking me along with you.

342
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,200
What's with you, Asuka?

343
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:06,664
It's your first time thanking me.

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,060
You, too, Shin.

345
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:10,560
Thank you.

346
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,130
What did I do?

347
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,955
All right. My house is that way.

348
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,911
Even though I don't quite understand it.

349
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,209
But I guess he's grown up.

350
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:26,771
Shin.

351
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,232
Wanna come to the laundromat?

352
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:29,779
Yes.

353
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:31,044
Let's go.

354
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:40,130
Shuu-kun.

355
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:42,880
Asuka.

356
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:44,930
You're back.

357
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:53,021
I...

358
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,172
I like you, Shuu-kun.

359
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,450
I'm back.

360
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:11,824
Want one, too?

361
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,028
Here.

363
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,521
From now on,

364
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:24,857
I'll stop seeing you.

(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

366
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:33,489
Even when the weather forecast
made a mistake,

367
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:36,715
Minato's Laundromat
is still open for business as usual.

372
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:49,160

My feelings for Shin...

373

(Lie to yourself, or be honest)
Shin's already leaving today.

374
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:51,889
Are you sure about this?

375
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:53,208
Minato-san.

376
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:54,511
