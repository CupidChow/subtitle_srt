7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,849
Minato-san.

8
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:25,359
Stop it.

9
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:27,728
I won't stop.

10
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:34,835
Hey, Shin. Shin!

11
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,554
Stop!

12
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:48,946
What the hell was I dreaming about?

13
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,010
And I just got a flu.

14
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:03,864
Ever since yesterday,

15
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,353
I haven't been able
to get his face out of my head.

16
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:10,329
It's as if I feel about him as...

17
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:11,957
No way.

18
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,642
I'm just feeling confused because of the fever.

19
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:17,820
No freaking way.

20
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,847
There's no way I'd fall for a highschooler.

21
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:23,183
That's right.
It's all a big misunderstanding.

22
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,185
I should just get some more sleep.

Minato Akira, Owner and Operator)

25
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:37,057
So he's read your texts but he isn't responding.

26
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,459
Minato-san hasn't replied back to any of my texts

27
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,510
ever since yesterday.

28
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:47,100
Well, that's just too many texts.

29
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,436
He's bound to freak out.

30
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,007
He isn't at the laundromat either.

31
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,240
I even went to his place and still no response.

32
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:59,079
Maybe I pissed him off.

33
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:01,001
Pissed him off? How so?

34
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,349
I don't know either.

35
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:07,846
You can try going to his house again later today.

36
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:18,165
Looks like you've got your eyes set for Akira-san, huh, Shin?

37
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,668
Don't call me Shin.

38
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:25,297
Since, when did you start having a crush on Akira-san?

39
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,074
I'm not telling you.

40
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:28,663
Anyway,

41
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,717
what exactly do you think of Minato-san?

42
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,017
What if...

43
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,251
I like Akira-san too?

44
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:40,528
What are you going to do about that?

45
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:07,381

47
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,317
Akira-san.

48
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,622
Akira-san. It's me, Asuka.

50
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,350
God, you're so loud.

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,348
What's the matter?
You're disturbing the entire neighborhood.

52
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,624
Minato-san.

53
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,197
We finally meet.

54
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,466
Is Shin here too?

55
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,763
Why didn't you contact me?

56
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:32,458
I have a really bad flu. I can't meet anyone.

57
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,476
I should completely avoid meeting people for now.

58
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,283
Why didn't you tell me?

59
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:38,606
Washing, cleaning, looking after you.

60
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,593
I want to do everything for you.

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,949
You can't do that.

62
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,651
Whatever.

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
Can you let us in? It's hot out here.

64
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:49,456
You can't come in. Absolutely not.

65
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,725
Look. I don't want to infect you guys.

66
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:54,461
Fine, we'll stay by the entrance.

67
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:56,976
Damn, it's so hot out here.

68
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,734
Excuse us.

69
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:06,713
Look.

70
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,922
Don't you open the door.

71
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,243
That means you want us to.

72
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,745
Not a bit.

73
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:15,352
Akira-san, why are you being such an introvert?

74
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:17,507
Why? What's wrong with that?

75
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:20,554
I haven't showered
so I'm completely worn out.

76
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:23,020
Minato-san, would you like me
to help you cleanse your body?

77
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:26,125
I often help my brother cleanse his body.
I'm sure I can help you too.

78
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,283
You wouldn't even need to move a finger.

79
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:29,563
Calm down, you idiot.

80
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,691
I can bathe myself just fine.
You don't have to worry about it.

81
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,401
Are you feeling hot or cold right now?

82
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:36,036
Should I bring you a warm towel?

83
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,304
I can do it for you.

84
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,111
Please let me do what I couldn't do before.

85
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,274
Shin-chan.

86
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,476
Just calm down, will you?

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,216
But...

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,046
Minato-san is fine.

89
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,681
I can't stand this anymore.

90
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,823
I'm heading out.

91
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,884
Hey, Asuka.

92
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:52,670
Don't leave yet. Hey.

93
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,813
See you, Akira-san. And Shin-kun.

94
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,895
No, wait. Hey.

95
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,129
Asuka.

96
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,182
You can't just go back alone.

97
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:06,633
Take Shin with you.

98
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,669
It's too scary to be alone with him right now.

99
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll be coming in now.

100
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:27,579
Minato-san.

101
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,990
Sorry for the sudden intrusion.

102
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,427
I promise I won't go into your room.

103
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:37,030
But can you at least open the door?

104
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,168
Fine.

105
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:06,493
Minato-san.

106
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,461
Are you mad at me?

107
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:09,696
Why would you think that?

108
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:11,598
I'm not mad.

109
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:12,988
Really?

110
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,200
Minato-san.

111
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,036
You have a fever.

112
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,021
If only I could, I would take your place.

113
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,188
No.

114
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,985
If you were to take my place, you'd be suffering.

115
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:39,293
Dummy.

116
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:47,380
Please reply to my texts.

117
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,135
You got me worried.

118
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,306
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,644
By the way, you look a bit different than your usual self.

120
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,140
What's wrong?

121
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,859
You'll probably get mad at me.

122
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:14,627
But can I say this?

123
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,030
No.

124
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,371
Don't say it.

125
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:21,167
You're so cute.

126
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,992
I told you not to say it.

127
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,376
I'll go ahead and prepare some porridge for you.

128
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:32,445
Please eat it when you can.

129
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,520
Damn it.

130
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:43,023
His kindness is too overwhelming.

131
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,092
No, it's all just in my head.

132
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:47,594
It's because of the fever,

133
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,696
It's all because of the fever.

134
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,019
Ouch, it hurts.

135
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,001
Please stop being so rowdy
and get some sleep, Minato-san.

136
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:56,870
Shut up!

137
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:00,140
Why did you suddenly call all of us here?

138
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,776
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see you all.

139
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,678
By the way, have you heard?

140
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,882
There's going to be a new teacher
since Suzugi-sensei is currently on leave.

141
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:10,826
Is that so? I wasn't aware of that.

142
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,063
I've heard it's a male teacher, right?

143
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:15,288
Yes, I think his name is Sakuma-sensei.

144
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:20,860
Sakuma-sensei.

145

(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)
Hey, Akira-kun.

146
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:27,700
I's like to buy some tea as well.
Could you please take it out for me?

147
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,402
Oh, it's been quite a while.

148
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,537
Yeah, long time no see.

149
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:31,810
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

150
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,280
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

151
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:37,188
- Can you listen to me?
- Sure.

152
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:39,254
My husband got home in the morning again.

153
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,194
Again?

154
00:09:50,294 --> 00:09:53,026
Oh. Did something good happen, Shin?

155
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,727
- Yes.
- What is it?

156
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,775
Minato-san has recovered from his flu.

157
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,302
That's great.

158
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:03,923
What is?

159
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:07,107
I envy both, you and Minato-san.

160
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:12,931
Sakurako, give this a try.

161
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,603
So?

162
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,095
Welcome.

163
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,736
Hey!

164
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,371
Stop right there. Hey!

165
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,368
Minato-san.

166
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,673
Shin, be careful. He's an underwear thief!

167
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:48,002
Move!

168
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,851
Ouch! It hurts!

169
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,054
Are you alright, Minato-san?

170
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:57,517
Yes.

171
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,505
Right, I need to call the police.

172
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,482
It's 119, right?

173
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:02,929
It's 110.

174
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,131
Thank you for your cooperation.

175
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:06,992
Get well soon.

176
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:07,921
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

177
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:08,948
Yes.

178
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:10,670
Thank you very much.

179
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,479
Wow.

180
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,682
Luckily, it's just bruised.

181
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,817
You are really strong.

182
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,854
I used to learn self-defense

183
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:30,156
with my sisters.

184
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:32,338
I see.

185
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:34,627
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,903
It's all because I came back too late...

187
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,199
No, no, no.

188
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,288
It's not your fault at all.

189
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,404
We were able to catch that thief, all thanks to you.

190
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,932
Besides,

191
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:49,042
it's just a small bruise.

192
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:52,879
If only I had come sooner...

193
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,916
Minato-san, I'm really sorry.

194
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:58,952
Hey, hey.

195
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:01,921
Why are you being dramatic all of the sudden?

196
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:04,924
I was just happy...

197
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,796
that Minato-san had finally managed to recover from his flu.

198
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,399
So, I wanted for you to eat some delicious food and got occupied preparing them.

199
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,503
That's why I came too late.

200
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,540
It's all my fault.

201
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:23,610
I'm really sorry.

202
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:29,836
I let you get hurt.

203
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:33,853
I can't forgive myself.

204
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,656
What the hell, Shin?

205
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,793
That feeling is too heavy.

206
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,365
Your face looks as if your body is hurting.

207
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,442
Why...

208
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:51,037
Why are you such an idiot?

209
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,772
Don't...

210
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,879
Don't just blame yourself as you please.

211
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,617
And stop looking so sad
as if you're about to cry.

212
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:10,403
You dumbass.

213
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,029
Are you all right, Shin?

214
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:54,667
I'm fine. Are you okay?

215
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,369
I'm totally fine.

216
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:57,441
(Do not wash blankets and mattresses.)

217
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:58,699
Let's just say...

218
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,902
it's not your fault.

219
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,184
Alright.

220
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:06,055
This conversation ends here.

221
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,449
Oh, boy. What have I done?

222
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,551
What the hell have I done?

223
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,248
Minato-san, just now...

224
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:16,135
Shut up.

225
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,588
The laundromat is closed for today.
You should go home.

226
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,694
But I'm worried about you...

227
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:22,929
Just go.

228
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:24,197
Just go home.

229
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:28,311
Don't make any detours.

230
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,113
Alright.

231
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,509
What the hell was I thinking?

232
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,244
Just now, I...

233
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,813
I was about to kiss him.

234
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:42,215
This is bad.

235
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:44,317
This is just like...

236
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,494
My social morality...

237
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,518
is dead or what.

238
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,300
You're consulting me again?

239
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:03,986
What is it this time?
He nearly hit you or what?

240
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,026
Yes.

241
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,839
It's probably a misunderstanding.

242
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:09,075
It's harmless Akira-san we're talking about.

243
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,850
He told me to stop looking like I was about to cry.

244
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,285
Then he grabbed me by the collar like this.

245
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:31,297
Get off of me. It's not what it looks like.

246
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:34,810
Shin, come here.

247
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,863
Because of you, now everyone thinks we're about to kiss each other.

248
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,543
Who would even want to?

249
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,316
Hey, don't walk away.

250
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,464
I'm not. I'm going to the restroom.

251
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:47,480
That's running away.

252
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,504
- Don't touch me.
- Why? It's okay.

253
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:57,171
(Congratulations on your recovery)

254
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:59,220
Congratulations, Minato-san.

255
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,659
What's with you? You're exaggerating.

256
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,704
Come on. You're unbelievable.

257
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,409
Your hand doesn't hurt anymore, right?

258
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,144
No.

259
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:19,504
You aren't mad, are you?

260
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,935
You are not going to hit me, right?

261
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:22,988
No.

262
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,684
Now let go of my hand.

263
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:31,485
It's Chinese food today.
What would you want to try?

264
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,849
Sweet and Sour Pork
and Stir-fried Beef with Bell Pepper.

265
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,858
Glass Noodle Salad.

266
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,645
Gyoza and Spring rolls.

267
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:45,872
All of it looks so fancy.

268
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,643
I'll have...

269
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,786
Sweet and Sour Pork.

270
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
Okay, Minato-san, open wide.

271
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:04,177
It's good.

272
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,360
Let's try this one.

273
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:09,384
Here.

274
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,197
I can eat by myself.

275
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,457
But you just let me feed it to you now.

276
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:20,640
It's good.

277
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,143
This one too.

278
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:30,149
Minato-san.

279
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:32,518
You're an adult.
Calm down a bit.

280
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,320
I'm fine, thanks.

281
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,998
There's absolutely, definitely, certainly

282
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:47,211
no way that I like this guy.

283
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:49,392
Oh, right.

284
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,117
Minato-san, there'll be
an open-class event next week.

285
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:55,074
Open-class?

286
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,842
It reminds me of the good, old days.

287
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:58,565
You should come.

288
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:01,502
There's also a sports event.
We'll be at the playground then.

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,083
If you come to support me,
I'll try my best.

290
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:07,653
I'm not even a parent.
Wouldn't it be weird if I went?

291
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:08,788
No, it wouldn't.

292
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,388
You should definitely come.

293
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:11,490
I'm not going.

294
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:14,025
Who would go to the open-class event?

295
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,328
I look forward to seeing you there.

296
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:17,330
Since you'll be coming to support me.

297
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:18,965
I said, I'm not going.

298
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,906
All right, today...

299
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,636
we will time the 1,500-meter run.

300
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,606
The starting point is right there. Get ready.

301
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,107
Yet, here I am.

302
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,067
Don't walk.

303
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,867
- Oh, boy.
- If you walk...

304
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,678
On weekdays like this,

305
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:35,948
someone like me wouldn't be here.
I mean, normally.

306
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,998
Oh, what is Akira-san doing?

307
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,634
Why must he disguise himself?

308
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,746
It's even more eye-catching.

309
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,045
Is he really a grown-up?

310
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:08,553
All right, ready.

311
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:13,848
You're about to show off to Akira, right?

312
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,322
I won't let you win.

313
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:18,678
Ready.

314
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:20,498
Go!

315
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:27,416
Keep up! You can do it!

316
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:35,741
So fast.

317
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,209
Those guys.

318
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:49,355
One more round.

319
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,023
It's the last round

320
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,858
Let's go, Shin.

321
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,459
You can do it.

322
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,092
You can do it.

323
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:02,640
Shin.

324
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:04,616
Don't give up.

325
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:08,162
You got this.

326
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,253
You can do it.

327
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:33,404
Shin.

328
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,025
Go for it!

329
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,549
That's the finish line.

330
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,843
Why are you so dazzling?

331
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,173
But...

332
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,321
I should have realized that now.

333
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:33,058
This feeling is not love.

334
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,228
I just want to watch...

335
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:40,232
over this dazzling fellow as he grows up.

336
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:43,922
That's right.

337
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,574
There's no way.

338
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:50,543
Minato-san.

339
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,581
Well done, Shin.

340
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:57,968
Yes.

341
00:21:58,238 --> 00:22:00,336
Thanks to you, my strength spiked.

342
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:07,153
It's not fair. You only cheer for Shin.

343
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,101
Come on, don't pout, Asuka.

344
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:10,937
You've done very well, too.

345
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,217
Good.

346
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:16,168
To congratulate the both of you,

347
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,767
we should celebrate.

348
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,862
What are you going to do for us?

349
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,607
I'll buy you some juice.

350
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:23,233
Again?

351
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:25,279
You're a cheapskate, Akira-san.

352
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,746
Is that Akira-kun?

353
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:42,548
Hello.

354
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:45,134
It's been a long time, Akira-kun.

355
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:52,280
Sakuma-sensei.

356
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,412
Why?

357
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,439
You must be a new teacher
who's replacing Suzugi-sensei.

358
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,354
Yes, that's right.

359
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:11,136
This is our homeroom teacher.

360
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:14,642
We were looking forward
to seeing him, right, Shin?

361
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:27,195
With the summer storm approaching us today,

362
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,769
the clothes that we hang outside may not get dry.

363
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,610
Such worries

364
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:35,370
can be immediately fixed
over at Minato's Laundromat.

365
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:39,691
Please continue to support us
next week as well.

366
00:24:44,825 --> 00:24:47,581
(Next Episode, Shin and Sakuma)
What do you think of Minato-san?

367
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:49,221
Are you back in Japan?

368
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:51,245
(A mysterious man appears before Asuka)

369
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,121
(Minato's decision)
Sensei, I...

370
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:54,116
(Minato's decision and...)

371
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,894
No matter who Minato-san likes,

372
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:57,563
I still like Minato-san.

373
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,587
(This drama is fictional.)
It's been a while, Akira-kun.
