Half a year ago...

13
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,618
when having to work overtime
in a black company every day,

14
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,445
the health of a man nearly 30
completely collapsed.

After quitting the job
and regaining health until completely healed,

17
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:12,516
I inherited the business from my grandfather
who wanted to retire himself.

18
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:19,103
At first, I couldn't do a proper job
as a new manager.

19
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,546
But now I quite like this job.

20

Ah, right.

27
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,137
It wasn't plugged in.

28
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,149

He's so tall.

- Are you a high school student?
- Yes.

34
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,636
- What year?
- I'm a senior.

35
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,503
Kids these days grow up so fast.

36
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:36,928
How tall are you?

37
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:39,316
It's 180 centimeters.

38
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:41,351
That's what I measured last year.

39
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,953
I may have gotten a bit taller now.

40
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,487
Growth spurts really are great.

41
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:51,302
He's quite muscular for his age.

42
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,864
His shoulders seem well-built.

43

He's so my type.

44

for the juice.

57

What?

58
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,172
It's okay. It's just a bottle of juice.

59
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,743
Please accept it.

60

- Yes.

It looks yummy.

67
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:42,706
I'll eat it then.

68
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,510
It's so good.

69
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:50,280
Where did you buy it from?

70
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:51,414
I'll buy it next time.

71
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:52,970
I made these myself.

72
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:54,646
You made these?

73
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,186
It's amazing.

74
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,373

75
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,164
tell me your name?

76

Well, Shin, you should eat some.

87

Never mind. I don't really like sweets.

Actually, I...

91
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,946
I don't really like sweets that much.

92
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:04,704
These cookies are really good.

93

send me snacks that goes with alcohol.

Hello, Minato-san.

97

It's terribly hot today.

98
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:33,925
The TV said summer had already begun.

99
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,495
Really?

100

Shin.

101
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:41,224
If it gets too hot,
feel free to go into the washer.

102
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:42,759
I won't fit in.

103
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,471
How about some juice?

104
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:47,964
This kind brother shall treat you.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,147
Okay.

106
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,036
Ever since the day I got those cookies,

107
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:55,872
Shin and I have been talking like this.

108
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,607
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

109
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:58,734

110
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,056
Thank you very much.

111
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:02,205
It may be a bit late to ask.

112
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,947
But don't you have a washer at home?

113
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:04,983
I do.

114
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,583
But we're a big family.

115
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,271
So someone is using it all the time.

116
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:09,386
How large is your family?

117
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:12,055
Two younger sisters, one younger brother,

118
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,879
grandpa, grandma, and parents,
so eight in total.

119
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:16,626
That's awesome.

120
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:18,294
That's nice. It seems sun.

121
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:19,730
Fun?

122
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,532
You're right. I don't feel lonely at all.

123
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,435
But it means I hardly have time for myself.

124
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,604
That's why when I come here,

125
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:29,906
I feel at ease to be able
to think alone in peace.

126
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,874
I see.

127
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:34,310
So am I disturbing your peaceful time?

128
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,881
- Should I go over there?
- Please stay here.

129
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,950

It's your cue to act cute,
and say, "Minato-san."

Well, then.

It's Minato-san.

You should get some sleep.

172
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,966
I'll be back in about an hour.

173
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,541
Oh, boy.

174
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:27,737
What is this?

175
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,009
My heart...

176
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:33,182
My heart is about to burst.

177
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:39,589
Get a grip.

178
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:41,252
Minato Akira.

179
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:47,451
He's just a high school student.

180
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,048
It's now up and running.

181
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:55,383
Thank you very much.

182
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,268
Thank you.

183
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,658
All right.

184
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,297
I am back.

185
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:24,117
Feel better?

186
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,402
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

187
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,602
Good to hear that.

188
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:30,106
One more thing.

189
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,375
The air-con at the shop has been repaired.

190
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,438
Really?

191
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,256
And I'd like to give you...

192
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,148
your new manga for this week.

193
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:43,405
But it's store's property.
Return it when you're done.

194
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,827
Thank you.

195
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,452
I'm so happy as I was curious
about what would happen next.

196
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:53,683
You know, you're really handsome.

197
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:59,602
I wish I was born
with a face and body like you.

198
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,260
What's with that?

199
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:02,972
I mean it.

200
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:06,098
For a hot guy like you,
girls probably won't leave you alone.

201
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:07,910
I don't care.

202
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:09,910
I'm not really interested.

203
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:11,793
Really?

204
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:15,961
Well, you don't seem to be the type
with that kind of needs.

205
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,390
Though that was all
I could think of in high school.

206
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:22,664
That kind of needs...

207
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,627
What do you mean?

208
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:29,065
Something like
"I want to be hugged by a handsome guy."

209
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,220
Sorry.

210
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,528
I didn't mean to hide it.

211
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:15,077
I'm gay.

212
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,884
Is that so?

213
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,827
I'll be going now.

214
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,199
Get home safe.

215
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:53,883
Hello.

216
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:57,204
Welcome.

217
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:00,389
It's been two weeks

218
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,061
since I told him about me being gay.

219
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,318
But it's good enough to see him come back.

220
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,072
It's been a while, Shin.

221
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:14,992
You know...

222
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,708
I know you're surprised,
but don't just run away like that.

223
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:20,997
That hurts my feelings, you know.

224
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:28,740
I'm just kidding with you.

225
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:32,993
By the way,
you have to take the entrance exam, right?

226
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,258
Have you been studying hard?

227
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,460
Minato-san, I have desire.

228
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,004
What did this kid just say?

229
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,306
Uh...

230
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,186
Shintaro-kun.

231
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:56,423
My frail wrist kind of hurts...

232
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,315
Even though you said
I didn't seem to be the type with desires,

233
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:03,501
But I do have the desire
to do it with someone I like.

234
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:05,796
Well...

235
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:09,005
Um...

236
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:17,023
Sorry.

237
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,282
What do you mean?

238
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,984
Thought I'm not thinking
about doing it right now.

239
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:31,547
How about we start with being friends first?

240
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,256
Minato-san.

241
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,155
Please be my friend.

242
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:46,095
- Okay.
- Answer clearly.

243
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,530
Does that mean a "yes"?

244
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,500
How to say this...

245
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,336
I mean, for me...

246
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:55,428
I thought we were already buddies.

247
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,519
Don't you think I'll be embarrassed now?

248
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,338
What are you smiling at?

249
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,410
- Let go of my hand already.
- No.

250
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,882
What do you mean "No"?

251
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,818
This uncle's old skin is delicate, you know.

252
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:10,084
Not a brother?

253
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:13,356
With my age,
I can be both a brother and uncle.

254
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:14,849
Let go.

255
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:21,993
Minato-san is so cute.

256
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,802
Shut up.

257
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,537
I swear I'll beat you.

258
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,739
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:33,943
I'm just very happy.

260
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:38,394
Thank you, Minato-san.

261
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,488
Please take care of me from now on.

262
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:58,293
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

263
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,336
Minato-san.

264
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:02,824
You startled me.

265
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,508
Minato-san, please have some of this.

266
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,311
What is this?

267
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:10,913
Snacks that go with booze.

268
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:14,016
Pickled gobo root, and chicken skin senbei.

269
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,385
And salad and pickled seaweed.

270
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:21,991
They all look delicious.

271
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,960
But what time do you think it is now?

272
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:26,729
It's fine. My curfew is at 10.

273
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:28,097
That's not where the problem is.

274
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,196
Wow, it's good.

275
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:43,432
Your cooking skill is really something.

276
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:52,722
This is nice.

277
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:02,851
Oh, right.

278
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:06,102
I was invited
to the high school reunion party.

279
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,172
No one knows that I'm gay.

280
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,675
It's gonna be hard to talk with them.

281
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:15,778
But I would be at a loss if you weren't gay.

282
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:27,556
The way you smile, pout, feel embarrassed...

283
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,326
The way your expressions change constantly.

284
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,239
I find it really cute.

285
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:35,431
Well, thank you for saying that.

286
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:40,037
I also like it
when you take care a kid like me.

287
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,638
Is that so?

288
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:43,739
Thank you.

289
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:47,904
Don't just touch me as you please.

290
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,311
I may charge you.

291
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,568
Fine. How much then?

292
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,752
- Five thousand yen for one touch.
- For anywhere?

293
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,517
You silly, only the hands.

294
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,885
Then that's so expensive.

295
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,366
You're so cheerful and friendly.

296
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:08,030
You're a great person, Minato-san.

297
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,069
You have many traits that I don't have.

298
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:28,037
Oh, right. The latest issue.

299
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:30,226
I haven't read it yet.

300
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,574
Wow, it's fun as always.

301
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,683
How irritating.

302
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,992
You keep doing this
even when the chance is open.

303
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,901
You should take action, but you chose to run.
It's so frustrating.

304
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,370
But that's also what I like about you.

305
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,884
So it really can't be helped.

306
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:03,181
Minato-san, I'll keep trying.

307
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:05,621
I'll come again tomorrow.

308
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:08,818
Eat up all these snacks.

309
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:12,361
Good night.

310
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,738
Shin's voice,

311
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,379
his attitude,

312
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,964
his facial expressions,

313
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,408
all keep looping in my head.

314
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:35,484
This feeling,

315
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
we know it very well.

316
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,028
No, this must be a joke.

317
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:49,999
No. No way.

318
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:54,737
It can't be Shin. It can't be.

319
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:07,149
Stop it.

320
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,392
I must stop. It can't be Shin.

321
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:12,147
He's a high school kid. I'm almost 30.

322
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,989
This can't be possible.

323
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,532
Minato-san.

324
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:22,226
Damn it. This kid.

325
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:25,707
Stop playing around with me.

326
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:30,472
What am I gonna do tomorrow?

327
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:34,075
We, Minato Shouji Coin Laundry,

328
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,712
are done for today.

329
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,882
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)
Please continue to support us from now on.

330
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,475
(Next Episode)

331
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:47,049
(Minato being approached constantly...!)
Say, "I like Shin."

332
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:48,951
It might be true if you say it.

333
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:50,953
(There's a girl with Shin)
Gosh, I'm confused.

334
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:53,055
Don't let a cute girl link arm with you.

335
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:54,957
Were you lonely not seeing me yesterday?

336
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,145
What did you say?

337
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,534
