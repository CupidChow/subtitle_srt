Not as a kid or a highschooler.

3
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:14,639
But as a man.

4
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:21,606
Please be my boyfriend.

5
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:32,949
(Good morning. Did you sleep well?
If you're feeling sleep-deprived, please take some vitamins.)

Minato-san.

7
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:36,257
Do you think it's okay for us to start dating each other?

8
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,014
I'd like to hear your answer soon.

9
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,313
The summer break course starts today.

10
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:48,916
I'll come to you as soon as I can.

11
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,287
Summer break course?

12
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,652
This kid is trying hard.

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,695
I have to think it through.

14
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,865
But before that...

15
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:09,531
I need to sort things out with Sakuma-Sensei.

16
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:18,378
All right.

17
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:19,875
Now is the time.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,149
First, I need to talk to Sensei.

19
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:25,519
I must erase all my stigma from the past.

You just focus on your study for now.)

22
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:43,739
What the heck is this?

23
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,971
So is this the answer
I've been waiting all day long?

00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:55,164
Am I your servant or what?

27
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,273
What are you looking at?

28
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:02,015
Nothing.

29
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,870
It's nothing.

30
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,010
I really don't get it.

31
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,359
Hey.

32
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:15,742
If there's anything
you'd like to consult with me...

33
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:20,267
I don't ask for advice from a virgin boy.

34
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,399
What?

35
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,953
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

36
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,977
Uh...

37
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:40,344
Sensei.

38
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:42,899
Yes?

39
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,281
I have something...

40
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:48,462
I'd like to talk to you about.

41
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,331
Sure, what is it?

42
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,469
Uh, about...

43
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,727
ten years ago.

44
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,977

46
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:09,011
Is it okay that I consult you
regarding my further studies?

47
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,546
Uh...

48
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,474
But now...

49
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:15,937
Please go ahead.

50
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:17,812
We can save this for later.

51
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,660
I'm sorry. Excuse me, then.

52
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,564
I guess we can't talk today.

53
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:28,096
Never mind, there's still time.

54
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:30,909
We can talk about it any time.

00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:36,943
Hello.

57
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,062
Oh.

58
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,617
Isn't Minato-san here?

59

Oh, I'm sorry.

Shuu-sensei.

61
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:10,555
What is it?

62
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:12,844
Uh...

63
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,714
Do you...

64
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:17,073
always come here to do the laundry?

65
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,062
It's just that...

66
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,344
my washing machine is broken.

67
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:24,791
I see.

68
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:28,641
My brother also comes here often.

69
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:29,863
And...

70
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:33,499
Minato-san always takes care of my brother.

71
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,876
So today. I made some snacks for him.

72
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:38,524
I see.

73
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,848

If you don't mind...

75
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:54,641
Here.

76
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,542
Please have some.

77
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,495
I mean...

78
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:06,163
I happened to make an extra batch.

79
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:29,529
How is it?

80
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,728
It's delicious.

81
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,429
Really?

82
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:44,704
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

83
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,739
Thank you.

84
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,010
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

85
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,070
No problem.

86
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,077
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

87
00:06:58,676 --> 00:06:59,773
Oh.

88
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,242
This towel...

89
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:38,094
Now that the summer break course is over,

90
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:39,659
thank you for your hard work.

91
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,430
It's just that...

92
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,698
your grade...

93
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:48,057
has been gradually dropping lately.

94
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,675
That includes the latest mock exam.

95
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:52,575
If this continues,

96
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:56,443
getting into a medical school
is going to be difficult.

97
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,703
What's wrong?

98
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:04,586
What's bothering you
that you can't concentrate on studying?

99
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:09,563
Or could it be...

100
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:11,912
about the person you like
that you told me before?

101
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:12,922
That's not it.

102
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:18,018
I'm not worried about anything.

103
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,883
Personally,

104
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,305
I think being obsessed with someone

105
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,775
so much so that you can't concentrate
is a wonderful thing.

106
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:32,746
Shintaro-kun.

107
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,772
Try facing your feelings head-on.

108
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:37,773
Don't run from it.

109
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,186
And try taking it slow.

110
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:42,756
If you do as I say,

111
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,739
I'm sure you'll see a clear path to take.

112
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:24,679
Akira-kun.

113
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,303
Oh, here.

114
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,404
Thank you very much.

115
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,062
It's no big deal at all.

116
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,269
(Shintaro)

117
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,516
Excuse me.

118
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,220
Hello, Shin.

119
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,455
Hello.

120
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,057
Minato-san, can we meet now?

121
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,562
Are you all right?

122
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:58,602
About studying, I mean.

123
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,405
Thank you for your concern.

124
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,373
But I'm okay.

125
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,266
No, I mean...

126
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:11,511
I'll go to the laundromat now.

127
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:15,915
Wait. Hey!

128
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,857
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

129
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:20,920
Shin.

130
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,719
Minato-san.

131
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:24,141
Welcome back.

132
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:26,766
You dumbass. What the hell are you doing?

133
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you mean?

134
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:30,057
We haven't seen each other in a while.

135
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:31,644
So I want you to eat a lot.

136
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,054
I woke up at 4 a.m. to make it.

137
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:38,671
Is it the time to do something like that?

138
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,874
Your entrance exam is approaching.

139
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:45,313
Why are you angry?

140
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,547
No.

141
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,007
I'm not angry.

142
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,414
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,863
Actually, at school earlier...

144
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:08,201
I overheard your talk with Sakuma-sensei.

145
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:13,373
Listen, Shin.

146
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,444
The reason your grade is dropping...

147
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,916
Could it be...

148
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,252
No, I'm sure about it.

149
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,195
It's because of me, right?

150
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,594
That's...

151
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,266
not your fault.

152
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,462
Why then?

153
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:51,110
It's just that

154
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:54,647
your face's been appearing in my head lately.

155
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,351
So I couldn't focus on my study. That's all.

156
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,621
Is that all?

157
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,602
The problem is that I like you too much.

158
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:09,167
I guess I can't do anything about it.

159
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,906
Let's just say,
it's something I have to deal with.

160
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:14,789
What?

161
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:17,689
Of course, it's a nice thing to deal with.

162
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,361
But there's also a lot to think about.

163
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,415
Because no matter what,

164
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,300
I seem to like you too much.

165
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,497
How could you become like this?

166
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,914
I like you so much that I can't hold it in.

167
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:03,559
Minato-san.

168
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:12,473
I'll go back and study now.

169
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:15,790
I don't want you to worry.

170
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,051
Here.

171
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,075
Make sure you eat up.

172
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:40,453
Shin can always...

173
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,212
face everything head-on.

174
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,693
Even so, I still...

175
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,928
keep looking for excuses.

176
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:52,132
I kept running...

177
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:55,296
from both Sensei and from my own feelings.

178
00:13:57,614 --> 00:13:58,971
All this time,

179
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,040
I've been too scared

180
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,317
to seriously face up to...

181
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,245
my own feelings.

182
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:21,260
Minato-san.

183
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,258
That's it...

184
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,205
(Watermelon Shake)

185
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:49,489
What is it?

186
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:51,219
It's nothing.

187
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:52,654
It may be late to say this.

188
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:54,964
But the fact that you like watermelon shake

189
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:56,562
is kind of cute.

190
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,056
Not really.

191
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm really not fond of sweets,
but I happen to like this flavor.

192
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,174
I always feel like drinking it
when summer arrives.

193
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,845
Let's drink it together again.

194
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,290
Next year, too.

195
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,063
Shin.

196
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,271
Shall we go for a walk?

197
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:37,998
About Sakuma-sensei,

198
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:43,471
I once told you that
it was just a delusion of adolescence.

199
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:46,679
That's a lie.

200
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:53,853
I was actually serious about it.

201
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:59,625
There were times
I felt like my heart shattered into pieces.

202
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,999
I seriously liked him.

203
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,470
But I was too scared.

204
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,442
I was scared that I'd be rejected
if I were to tell him my feelings.

205
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:20,613
The very thought of it terrified me.

206
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:24,947
Minato-san.

207
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:27,869
Even though...

208
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:30,957
you say you still like him,

209
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,227
I don't care.

210
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:35,016
If you can't date a highschooler,

211
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:36,981
I can wait until after graduation.

212
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:40,861
I just...

213
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,925
want to be by your side.

214
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,004
Other than that,

215
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,154
I won't expect much.

216
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:05,024
I've thought long and hard

217
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,160
about you.

218
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,364
I'll be serious now.

219
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:17,623
I...

220
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:29,742
I can't date you.

221
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,051
Why not?

222
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,394
Or is it because you're worried about my grade?

223
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,063
If that's the case, I will study hard

224
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:46,399
and get into a good university.

225
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,002
Yeah, right.

226
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,638
I'm sure you can achieve it.

227
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:55,708
Because you're tough

228
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:00,413
and more straightforward than anyone I know of.

229
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,583
You're so dazzling.

230
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,651
But it's just not possible.

231
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,422
It's not you who isn't good enough. It's me.

232
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,391
It's not because
you're preparing for a big test,

233
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,174
nor the fact that you're a highschooler,

234
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,363
or you're not good enough.
None of that is the problem.

235
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,467
I'm just...

236
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,402
too weak.

237
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,737
I'm a coward

238
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,974
who always runs away hopelessly.

239
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:31,978
As long as I'm still not clear
about how I feel,

240
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,381
I can't be by your side.

241
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,687
What about Sakuma-Sensei?

242
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,809
Do you still like him?

243
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,996
Then I...

244
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,987
I'll wait until you like me.

245
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:55,041
Even if it takes ten years

246
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,235
or 20 years from now.

247
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,238
I can wait for you

248
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:00,506
no matter how long it takes.

249
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:02,206
So please...

250
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:03,277
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:06,901
This is my problem.

252
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,985
All this time,
I've lived my life trying to avoid all the pain.

253
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:21,894
But if I am to be with you,
I can't be like that.

254
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,432
I guess I realized this a little late.

255
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,175
Thank you, Shin.

256
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,448
But I really can't date you.

257
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:55,730
Is this...

258
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:59,480
your answer?

259
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,536
Yes, it is.

260
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:16,899
I got it now.

261
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:22,507
So in that case...

262
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:24,552
can I kiss you just once?

263
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,706
What? What's with you?

264
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,061
Why not? Just one last time.

265
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,498
If we kiss now,
you will taste the watermelon shake you like.

266
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:33,941
Are you crazy?

267
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,152
I can't allow that.

268
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:36,535
- You're mean.
- Shut up.

269
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:38,270
That's enough.

270
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:40,239
If you don't do it, I will.

271
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,475
Hey, no!

272
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:44,228
Ouch!

273
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:47,796
It hurts.

274
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,416
I'm just kidding.

275
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:52,288
This punk.

276
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:04,777
But I...

277
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,133
don't regret it at all,

278
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,004
having a crush on you.

279
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:19,890
I'm grateful for the manga I read.

280
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,950
For the croquettes at the market.

281
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,228
For that night at the swimming pool.

282
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,092
And for the watermelon shake.

283
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:38,392
We talked a lot of nonsense.

284
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,034
We laughed together.

285
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:44,170
We even got into a fight.

286
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,841
The summertime that I spent with you.

287
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,577
It will forever...

288
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,781
stay with me as my most precious treasure.

289
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:24,109
Lastly,

290
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,546
I have just one request.

291
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:32,358
Please don't forget this.

292
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:37,939
The only person

293
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,060
I'll love in my life

294
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,732
is you, the one and only Minato Akira.

295
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,752
(Next Episode)
Summer is over. Get your act together,

296
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,653
(Summer is over, but not love.)
Minato Akira.

297
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,088
(Summer is over, but not love.)
Isn't it your decision?

298
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,457
Sensei, can I have a minute?

299
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:53,726
(Their courageous moves)
My feelings for you...

300
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,894
I need to talk to you.

301
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,853
I gotta do it this time.

302
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,350
(This drama is fictional.)
I'll get it over with.
