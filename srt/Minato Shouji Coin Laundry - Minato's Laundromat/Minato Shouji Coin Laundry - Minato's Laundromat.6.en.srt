1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,969
Welcome.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,372
It's been a while, Akira-kun.

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,148
Saki.

4
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:09,789
Why...

5
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:11,827
Is this the latest issue?

6
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:13,514
Uh, yes.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:14,953
But...

8
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,350
You know, the main character

9
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:19,093
seems to be incredibly slow
when it comes to love.

10
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:20,664
That's right.

11
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:22,182
No, I mean...

12
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,390
Are you healthy now?

13
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:27,995
Well, you quit the job
right after you collapsed.

14
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,599
Thanks for your concern. But I'm fine now.

15
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:34,890
No, I mean...

16
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:36,773
why are you...

17
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:38,687
suddenly showing up?

18
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:40,841
What's with you?

19
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,246
Isn't this a laundromat?

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,746
Well, yeah.

21
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:49,783
Well, of course.

22
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:52,204
I'm here to do some laundry.

23
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:55,156
What?

24
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,326
Machida Saki.

25
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,695
We used to work together in Tokyo.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,765
Akira-kun.

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,834
It's lunch time. Won't you give yourself a break?

28
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,103
Well, I wish I could do that.

29
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,536
But I have to go home on time today.

30
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,607
Are you...

31
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:16,176
going on a date?

32
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:18,636
Nah, it can't be.

33
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,827
You changed your thought so quickly.

34
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:22,950
I'm expecting a parcel today.

35
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:25,652
They've tried to
to deliver it three times already.

36
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,689
I see, it's not so inconvenient living alone.

37
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,158
You know, there was a time

38
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:32,626
when I tried to put
the hot compress on my back.

39
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,161
I ended up getting my arm sprained in this position.

40
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,126
And I had to go out
to receive the parcel like this.

41
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:39,833
Actually, me too.

42
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:42,135
There was a time when I had a high fever.

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,229
I thought I was going to die alone.

44
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,421
To die alone?

45
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:55,647
Yeah.

46
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,491
In that case...

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,157
should we try dating each other then? What do you think?

48
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:13,919
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,185
I'm serious.

50
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:19,639
And for that very reason,

51
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,857
we started dating each other.

52
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,208
"Minato's Laundromat"

53
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:33,914
After you collapsed while working,

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,484
our company transfomed from a black hell
to a dark gray one.

55
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,244
It's still as dark as ever.

56
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,724
So I'm giving myself a vacation
that I've haven't had for a very long time.

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,605
I was thinking about the hot springs.

58
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:49,503
And since I am in the area,
I thought I should go pay my ex a visit.

59
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:52,899
I see. So that's why.

60
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:56,136
Did you think I'm here
to ask you to get back together?

61
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:57,832
No, it's not that.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,913
I'm relieved now.

63
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:03,434
You look livelier than I thought.

64
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:08,536
How long do I have to wait?

65
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,207
About an hour.

66
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:15,188
Well, then...

67
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:17,424
can you show me around your hometown?

68
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:31,138
(Sakuma Store)

69
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,973
How was Europe?

70
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,578
I spent two weeks in Barcelona
to follow in Gaudi's footsteps.

71
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:41,248
Then I went to Prague and Budapest.

72
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:44,215
Would you like to go through the photos from the trip?

73
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:52,259
Awesome.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,830
There are places I want to visit as well.

75
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,005
What's the matter?

76
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:06,317
Asuka.

77
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:11,543
Is everything okay with your study?

78
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,067
Oh, yes.

79
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,913
Everything is fine.

80
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,359
By the way, why did you happen to come here?

81
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:25,325
Just like that.

82
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,594
Nothing in particular.

83
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:31,867
I guess I just...

84
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,670
I wanted to see you.

85
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:38,798
Why?

86
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,386
About that...

87
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,622
I just felt like it.

88
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:09,102
I still can't figure out what he's thinking.

89
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,165
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,439
But I have something
I'd like to talk to you about.

91
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,552
Uh...

92
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,387
Well...

93
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,010
What is it?

94
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,344
Katsuki.

95
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,438
Do you like men?

96
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,974
Huh? Well, I've never thought about that.

97
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:51,521
I'm so sorry
for asking such a weird question.

98
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:53,213
But the person I like is a man.

99
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:55,804
Why? Is there an issue with that?

100
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,385
It's nothing...

101
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:01,421
It's a rare sight to see you together.

102
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,489
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:03,517
Asuka.

104
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,098
No, it's nothing.

105
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:09,629
What's with her? What happened?

106
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:10,830
I don't know.

107
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,951
I guess it's your fault.

108
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,038
- Two croquettes, please.
- Okay.

109
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,239
That will be 260 yen please.

110
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,205
It's good.

111
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:24,277
It's so good.

112
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,816
I think I can eat three pieces.

113
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:33,926
Granny Uta.

114
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,989
Oh, Akira-kun.

115
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:38,124
Are you going for a walk today?

116
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:39,104
Yes.

117
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,129
Hey, Akira-kun.

118
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,914
Here. It's today's specialty.

119
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:44,864
It's a red-banded grouper. Want some?

120
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:46,822
Come on, you should try it.

121
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,803
Which would you like?

122
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,407
- What about Aji fish?
- Aji fish?

123
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,709
Akira-kun.

124
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,608
You're so different
from how you were when working in the company.

125
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:58,657
You think so?

126
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,761
You look so lively here.

127
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,917
Lively?

128
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:05,973
That's because it's my hometown.

129
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,673
It's where I belong.

130
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,525
It suits me better than Tokyo.

131
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:17,364
Is that all?

132
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:22,149
Is that the reason we broke up?

133
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:28,405
At the time,

134
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,991
you suddenly quit your job

135
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,446
and disappeared without saying a word.

136
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,144
It's like you said, "Goodbye."

137
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,854
Did you really think I could just accept
something like that?

138
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:44,679
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:46,346
Just tell me

140
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,194
the whole truth.

141
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:51,354
If you loved me,

142
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:54,865
you wouldn't break up with me
just to go back to your hometown.

143
00:08:58,035 --> 00:08:59,175
Or...

144
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:02,073
are you in love with someone else?

145
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,679
Minato-san.

146
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,355
Shin.

147
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,122
What are you doing here?

148
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:19,359
Uh, nothing.

149
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:21,233
Is he your friend?

150
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,918
Yes, now we are just friends.

151
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,355
- Now?
- Shut up.

152
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:29,903
Can you not say things that might confuse people?

153
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,105
What do you mean?

154
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,572
I mean...

155
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:34,074
Who is that lady?

156
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,043
You seemed uncomfortable talking to her.

157
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,105
She's a colleague for mine
from the old company that I used to work for.

158
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,237
Is she a stalker?

159
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,617
- How is that possible?
- It is.

160
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,219
Because you're cute.

161
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,488
I'm going to talk to her.

162
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,356
Wait, wait, wait.

163
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,308
She's my ex-girlfriend.

164
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:00,954
Ex-girlfriend?

165
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:05,271
Is everything okay?

166
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,857
Did you date Minato-san?

167
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:10,939
Hey!

168
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:12,065
Yes.

169
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:14,981
What did you do...

170
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,219
to make him fall for you?

171
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,275
Why did you ask her that out of the blue?

172
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:26,626
No, I just want to keep it
as future reference.

173
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,540
What's that?

174
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:32,899
So you used to date a woman.

175
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,736
Of course, I've had that kind of experience.

176
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:40,828
Did you love her?

177
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:43,658
Yes.

178
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,237
You said she's your ex.
That means you already broke up.

179
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:47,802
Yes, that's right.

180
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,433
Were you the one who broke up with her?

181
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,584
Yes, it was me.

182
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,175
You don't feel anything now, right?

183
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,386
Yes, that's right.

184
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,456
- What's this all about?
- How about...

185
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,041
Sakuma-sensei?

186
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:15,549
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,646
I wasn't behaving properly.

188
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,845
I'll get going now.

189
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:25,451
Hey!

190
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:26,640
Shin.

191
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:37,753
Hey, what is it you want to talk about?

192
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,471
I don't want to be misunderstood
about this morning.

193
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,031
You mean Shin?

194
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,102
Actually, I...

195
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:57,283
I'm...

196
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:01,149
I'm a BL fangirl.

197
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,857
That's why I wanted to root for the two of you.

198
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:07,327
I didn't mean
to interfere with your relationship at all.

199
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,861
Actually, I ship you guys so much.

200
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:12,298
Wait a minute.

201
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:13,800
Excuse me.

202
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,803
There's something I don't understand.

203
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:18,925
What are you talking about?

204
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,495
Aren't you and Katsuki in a relationship?

205
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,747
No, not with him.

206
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:28,674
No?

207
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,148
But I often saw you guys together.

208
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:36,656
Oh, boy. It's only my imagination then.

209
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,214
By the way,

210
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,764
Katsuki is so awesome

211
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:50,403
to openly talk
about the person he likes like that.

212
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,911
I don't think I can do that.

213
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:55,942
Well...

214
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,961
I still can't get used

215
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,579
to his straightforwardness.

216
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,780
- Bye.
- See you.

217
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:04,751
Bye, Shuu-sensei.

218
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,588
(Meiji University Seminar)
Oh, Shin.

219
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:09,996
Are you here to pick me up?

220
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:12,106
Mom asked me to take you home.

221
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,830
Isn't he cool, Shuu-sensei?

222
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:27,194
I mean the teacher earlier.

223
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:29,942
He is now studying for a Ph.D.

224
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:32,381
in Architecture at the university.

225
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,751
And he just came back
from traveling around the world.

226
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,820
Is that so?

227
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:41,821
Are you okay, Shin?

228
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:43,566
Has something happened?

229
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:46,259
No, it's nothing.

230
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:48,630
Is that right?

231
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,101
I hope it'll be Shuu-sensei again tomorrow.

232
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,007
I really want to see him.

233
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,223
I know.

234
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,297
I want to see him too.

235
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,391
Thank you so much for today.

236
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,120
I had so much fun.

237
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:17,664
I'll get going now.

238
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:20,812
Saki.

239
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,242
It's nothing.

240
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,306
Take care.

241
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,980
You too.

242
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:54,394
I seem to not be able to stop

243
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:56,596
running away.

244
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,031
Shin.

245
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,897
I'm sorry about earlier.

246
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,412
Has that person left?

247
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:15,765
Yes.

248
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:18,578
What's the matter?

249
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,086
It's pretty late now.

250
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,968
Minato-san.

251
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,848
Can you cheer me up a bit?

252
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,185
Maybe a kiss or more.

253
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,812
Or anything.

254
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,669
I really can't tell
if you're greedy or modest.

255
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:39,539
Can't you give me that?

256
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:44,877
All right.

257
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,345
It can't be helped then.

258
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:47,946
Come here.

259
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,121
This is a magic charm to cheer you up.

260
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:58,742
It's been passed down
through the Minato family.

261
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:02,523
Shin.

262
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,466
You're an amazing person.

263
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,002
Much more than someone like me.

264
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,104
Don't make a long face again.

265
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:32,820
That's it.

266
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:35,282
Minato Family's magic charm has been spelled.

267
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:39,656
Thank you so much.

268
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,222
I feel much better now.

269
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,173
Good night.

270
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,112
What's going on with me?

271
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,714
Shin feeling all gloomy

272
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,815
is all because of me.

273
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:02,421
And Saki too.

274
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,190
Just tell me

275
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:05,958
the whole truth.

276
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,498
Ultimately, it's the same.

277
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:12,431
I always keep running away from something important.

278
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,333
Is it alright of me

279
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:16,569
to let this go on?

280
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:26,712
Saki.

281
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,017
Akira-kun.

282
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:39,178
I'm sorry, Saki.

283
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,528
- I...
- Wait, what are you doing?

284
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,200
The truth is...

285
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:52,405
The truth is that...

286
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:55,952
I'm gay.

287
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,752
When you asked to date me, I was thrilled.

288
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,860
The time we spent together was amazing.

289
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:13,896
So amazing that I thought...

290
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:17,597
we could still laugh together about it
even when we're old.

291
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:21,824
But I couldn't do it.

292
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:25,838
I know...

293
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:29,909
that I am...

294
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,616
a terrible person.

295
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,440
A coward who couldn't face the truth head-on.

296
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,322
I fled back to my hometown
without telling you the truth.

297
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:48,233
I only thought about myself.

298
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,032
And I'm really pathetic for doing so.

299
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:57,730
I'm truly very sorry.

300
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,260
You dumbo.

301
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:11,885
You're such a fool

302
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,846
to carry everything on yourself

303
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,424
and to run away.

304
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,570
Look at me.

305
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:33,972
I'm the type that even if
I got dumped in the savannah,

306
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:36,494
I'd still be able to survive on my own.

307
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,479
What I'm saying is...

308
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,508
you didn't need to hide it from me at all.

309
00:19:43,736 --> 00:19:44,917
Actually, I'm subscribed to about

310
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:47,386
seven dating apps right now.

311
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:49,110
Seven?

312
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,191
Nahh, I'm just joking.

313
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,760
But next time...

314
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,896
I won't let it go.

315
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:01,190
I will use these two hands of mine
to grab my own happiness.

316
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,343
I hope you do the same.

317
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:10,455
If you remain clueless about your love,

318
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,447
I won't forgive you even if you promise
to buy me croquettes forever.

319
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:16,549
What's with you?

320
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:18,456
I mean it.

321
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:22,750
I hope you find real happiness.

322
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,802
Thank you, Saki.

323
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:34,967
(Minato-san is cute.
Shut up. Be careful when you come.)

324
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:36,524
(Okay. Thank you.
My class is over. I'm on my way now.)

325
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,725
It's time...

326
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,006
I settle things with Shin.

327
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:46,712
(Minato-san, the Last Boss battle is today.)

328
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:48,222
(I won't be stopping by.)
Last Boss Battle?

329
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,985
Awesome. Lots of washing machines here.

330
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,190
Wait, it's dangerous to do that.

331
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,379
Oh.

332
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:02,962
I've seen this kid before.

333
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,723
Jeez, Yu. You ran so fast.

334
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:08,066
Sister.

335
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:09,201
Sakurako-chan.

336
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,457
Sister?

337
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:13,939
Minato-san, good morning.

338
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:15,604
This is Yutaro, my younger brother.

339
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:20,813
So is he Shin's younger brother?

340
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,347
Yes.

341
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:26,875
Minato-san,
can you come to our house sometimes?

342
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:29,558
What?

343
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,191
It's nearly Shin's birthday.

344
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:35,060
And we're planning to have a birthday party for him at home.

345
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,123
But...

346
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:40,199
Please.

347
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,672
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

348
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:49,353
Here's the invitation card.

349
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:53,183
(Invitation card for Mr. Minato)

350
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,207
Wait.

351
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,894
Yu-kun.

352
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,746
Have we met before?

353
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,403
No, never.

354
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,394
Is that right?

355
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:09,651
It's probably a mistake then.

356
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,063
Maybe...

357
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:13,755
you mean Shin?

358
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,228
They say Yu looks exactly like Shin
did when he was little.

359
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:25,065
(Career Guidance)
The reason I've called you over...

360
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,745
is so that we can talk about your future.

361
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,186
You left it blank
for the school you wish to go to next.

362
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,641
I'm still torn between going to Tokyo

363
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:39,458
or staying in my hometown.

364
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,918
I heard you want to become a doctor,
am I right?

365
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,737
If that's the case,

366
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:49,065
there are more options for you in Tokyo.

367
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:52,425
With your grades, you can definitely
aim for a national level university.

368
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:58,158
What's the reason
you don't want to leave your hometown?

369
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,915
The person I love is here.

370
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,417
This person is someone that...

371
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:07,666
I've been thinking of ever since I was a kid.

372
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:11,229
What he said that day...

373
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,727
What I've felt...

374
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,630
for ten years...

375
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,232
Shin and I...

376
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,841
Did we meet...

377
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,605
ten years ago?

378
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:29,883
At Minato's Laundromat,

379
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,659
even a suit or a dress
that is hung in the closet for a long time

380
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,448
can be thoroughly cleaned.

381
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,692
Please continue to support us next week.

382
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:45,594
(Next Episode)

383
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,052
(The Meet and Ten-Year Long Memories)
I want you to see something.

384
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:48,362
So the kid at that time...

385
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,022
Do you have someone you like?

386
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:51,590
He's my tutor.

387
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,459
Have you forgotten that promise?

388
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:54,223
Are you crazy?

389
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,594
(Confession from Shin)
The crazy one is you.

390
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,963
You are my first love.

391
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,629
(This drama is fictional.)
Please go out with me.
