1
00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:04,037
We’re so sad, Sensei.

2
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:08,642
When look at him,

3
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:15,749
my chest always feels tight.

4
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,188
Today is my last chance.

5
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:23,080
We won't...

6
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:24,858
be seeing each other again.

7
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:27,120
Sakuma-sensei.

8
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,962
What is it, Akira-kun?

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,548
"I like you."

10
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:43,782
Such simple words...

11
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:46,780
But I can't say it.

12
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,983
"Minato's Laundromat"

13
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,249
I like you.

14
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:58,819
Katsuki Senpei.

15
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:02,865
Will you go out with me?

16
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,053
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:06,999
I already have someone I like.

18
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,663
That's the fifth girl this year.

19
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:23,102
Who is this person that Katsuki-kun likes?

20
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:31,017
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

21
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,214
(Takeda: Invitation to the party.)

22
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:33,787
You must come to the reunion party!

23
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:35,985
Sakuma-sensei is coming, too!

24
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:41,299
What should I do?

25
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,831
I really don't want to go.

26
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,393
Where don't you want to go?

27
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:53,173
Stop doing that!

28
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:56,109
Minato-san.
Where don't you want to go?

29
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,375
The reunion party.

30
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,152
I see, the one you mentioned before.

31
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,962
Don't go if you don't want to.

32
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,862
It's not that simple.

33
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,838
What now?

34
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,875
I found this.

35
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,088
Over there.

36
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,574
Someone must have forgotten it.

37
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,301
Thank you.

38
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,224
Gosh.

39
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,786
I'm only returning this Granny Uta.

40
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,222
Why must you come along?

41
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:43,870
What if something happens to you?

42
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:45,192
Nothing will happen to me.

43
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:47,627
You have no sense of danger.

44
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,529
You’re so easily tricked by food.

45
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:52,165
- Don’t you realize how cute you are?
- Hey.

46
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:54,997
Cute? I’m almost 30 years old.

47
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:57,567
And…

48
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:01,098
Are you trying to insult me or praise me?
Just pick one.

49
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,252
Granny Uta, are you there?

50
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,667
Hi, Asuka. Is your grandma here?

51
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:13,474
She went out with my dad.

52
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:15,304
What's up?

53
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:18,794
Wait.

54
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,228
Katsuki? What are you doing here?

55
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,696
You know each other?

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,064
He was my classmate.

57
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,528
Is that so?

58
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,020
Oh, right. Here.

59
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,073
Your grandmother's scarf.
Can you give it to her?

60
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:32,012
Oh, that's right. Thank you.

61
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:34,138
By the way…

62
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,365
You bought some scallops
from us the other day, right?

63
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,990
Oh yeah, Shin brought a grill
and we ate it together.

64
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:42,984
Right? It was delicious.

65
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:44,977
Oh, right.

66
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,462
You can join us next...

67
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:56,730
I wonder who it is.

68
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:57,995
Hey!

69
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,155
(Akira)

70
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,794
Akira?

71
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:04,817
So that Akira is… Akira-san?

72
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:07,141
What?

73
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:11,825
So it's Akira-san, huh?

74
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,582
What’s going on?

75
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,084
Hey, don't leave me hanging like this.

76
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,645
Akira-san, are you dating this guy?

77
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:25,144
- What are you talking...
- We will be in the future.

78
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:27,706
Says who?

79
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,864
And you shouldn't be asking
about such nonsense.

80
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,547
Shin, let's head back.

81
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:36,989
I see.

82
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:39,419
So it's one-sided love, isn't it?

83
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:41,528
Poor you.

84
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,483
(Sato's Meat Shop)

85
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:48,545
Akira-kun, what would you like today?

86
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:51,106
How about some croquettes?

87
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:56,560
Hey.

88
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:58,931
Rebel boy.

89
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,083
I’ll buy you a treat.

90
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,363
Don't call me that.

91
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:05,398
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,034
Choose one you like.

93
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,096
Which do you recommend?

94
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,260
The croquette, of course.

95
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,475
Crab cream and vegetable filling
are both delicious.

96
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:21,360
Nice!

97
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:22,985
I know, right?

98
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:25,819
Back in high school,

99
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:28,559
I’d always buy a croquette
on the way back home.

100
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,758
And eat it here with everyone.
Those were the days.

101
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:36,096
That means someone you liked
was in that group.

102
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:37,322
Yes.

103
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,035
What? No there wasn’t.

104
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,290
So where is he?

105
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:48,103
There was, right?
Someone you fancied.

106
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,103
Yes.

107
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,109
Who was it? Your classmate?

108
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,694
A teacher.

109
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:06,931
A teacher?

110
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:11,493
Sakuma Sensei.

111
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,352
My homeroom teacher.

112
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:17,829
And the swimming club's advisor.

113
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,263
Someone I really liked.

114
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,464
Was this Sakuma…

115
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,454
a male teacher?

116
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,415
Yes.

117
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:36,844
I heard he's coming to
the reunion party too.

118
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:39,735
So I feel a bit awkward.

119
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:43,050
Could it be that...

120
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,964
you're still not over him?

121
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,563
Of course not!

122
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:49,454
It's been years.

123
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:50,706
Then why...

124
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:51,741
Well...

125
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,199
It's just that...

126
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,126
When I was in high school,

127
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:57,610
I had pretty strong desires.

128
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,209
Now that I think about it,
I’m not even sure if it was love.

129
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:13,475
Please don’t...

130
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,290
Make that face..

131
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:19,800
Because of someone like me.

132
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,301
Dummy.

133
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:26,414
Hey, Shin.

134
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:29,396
Get a grip.

135
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,020
Maybe you’re just like me.

136
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,016
You’re attracted to an older man,

137
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:38,906
and mistook it for love.

138
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,835
Now that I think back…

139
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:50,257
it's a common thing for teenagers.

140
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,273
You'll realize that someday, too.

141
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,755
Your feelings right now…

142
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,266
are just ––

143
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,029
Why...

144
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,213
Why are you asserting what it is I feel?

145
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:20,264
What I’ve been feeling...

146
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,021
for the past ten years...

147
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:37,888
Ten years?

148
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:44,230
Hey, Shin.

149
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,546
My feelings aren't a delusion.

150
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,504
The person I like is Minato Akira.

151
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,626
(Keyaki High School)

152
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,744
- Let's go together.
- Let's go!

153
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:07,173
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

154
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:08,842
Let's meet at the station as usual.

155
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,577
- Okay?
- Okay, got it.

156
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,340
I’ll be there!

157
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:14,410
Shin.

158
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,849
Good morning, Shin.

159
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,985
Don't touch me.
Don't look at me. Don't talk to me.

160
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,888
Were you always like this?

161
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,446
Come on, Shin Shin.

162
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,623
Don't call me that.

163
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,592
Doesn't Akira-san call you Shin?

164
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,060
Don't call him Akira-san.

165
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,762
Are you still mad about yesterday?

166
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,397
About that…

167
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,434
What's your relationship with Minato-san?

168
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:37,848
- Well, we're quite intimate.
- What?

169
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:42,512
The older guys in the shopping district
have always looked after me.

170
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:46,286
And sometimes Akira-san
takes me to the public bathhouse.

171
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:53,720
The bathhouse…with Minato-san?

172
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,464
Yes, the bathhouse.

173
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,681
Hey, Shin.

174
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:24,184
Hey, Shin. Back to Earth.

175
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,269
Shin.

176
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:27,253
Come back, Shin.

177
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:28,909
Hey, Shin.

178
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:31,958
Hey, wait.

179
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,319
You know, maybe Akira-san ignores you…

180
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:35,695
because you try too hard.

181
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,719
- Perhaps you should give him some space?
- No.

182
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:39,599
Maybe just give up?

183
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:42,135
He seems to have good sense.

184
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,070
He wouldn't lay a finger on a high schooler.

185
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,076
How about…

186
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:56,617
You be with me?

187
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:03,938
I want to be with Minato Akira.

188
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,666
I’m just kidding. Why so serious, Katsuki!

189
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,257
Let the party of Class C,
Keyaki high begin!

190
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,676
Cheers!

191
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,545
Cheers!

192
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,557
You actually showed up, Minato,

193
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:28,514
Of course.

194
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,526
Why didn’t you come
to the previous parties?

195
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:33,253
I was living in Tokyo,
and I was very busy.

196
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:34,554
You live here now, don't you?

197
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:37,023
Yes, I took over my grandpa's laundromat.

198
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,458
I'm taking it easy now.

199
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,426
I see. Are you married?

200
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,828
Not yet.

201
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,896
Seriously, you’re still single?

202
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,428
- So lonely.
- Shut up.

203
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,703
I thought you were popular with girls.

204
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:52,197
No women would want
to be near a weirdo like me.

205
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,408
By the way...

206
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:01,147
What about...

207
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:04,884
Sakuma-sensei?

208
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,565
He caught a cold. Couldn't make it.

209
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,356
He hasn't changed at all.

210
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:12,899
He’s always sick on important days.

211
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:16,461
At least he miraculously managed
to attend our graduation ceremony.

212
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,131
I missed him so much.

213
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,141
Yeah.

214
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:29,690
Why do I feel relieved?

215
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:31,616
What a wimp.

216
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,361
So it's been ten years already…

217
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,797
since we graduated?

218
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,500
What I’ve been feeling…

219
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,524
for the past ten years…

220
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,107
What did he mean by ten years?

221
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,433
Have we met before?

222
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,446
I don't get him.

223
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:07,658
Minato-san.

224
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:10,285
Shin.

225
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:11,976
What are you doing here?

226
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:14,454
I went to see you but you weren't there.

227
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:17,038
You said you were going to the reunion.

228
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:20,005
So I thought maybe you saw your teacher,
yearned for the old days…

229
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:22,694
And came here.

230
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,597
You can be really scary sometimes.

231
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:27,196
Are you a detective or what?

232
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:30,290
Anyway.

233
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,079
I didn't see Sakuma-sensei today.

234
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,052
He had a cold. Couldn't come.

235
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,686
Now…

236
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:48,840
Since we're here...

237
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:51,383
shall we check out the swimming pool?

238
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,102
Wait.

239
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,773
Minato-san, this is trespassing.

240
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:57,730
I'm a former student.

241
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,933
You're a present student.

242
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,281
We're just checking
if there's anything suspicious.

243
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,264
Won't be a problem.

244
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,210
Minato-san, wait for me.

245
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:12,545
Hurry up.

246
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,389
This takes me back.

247
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,726
This place hasn't changed at all.

248
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:34,751
Shin.

249
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,768
You said you stopped swimming
because of your back injury.

250
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:40,689
Do you still swim at all?

251
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:42,884
In PE classes.

252
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,236
But I can't swim for
more than a few hours.

253
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:47,326
Is that so?

254
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,905
I hope I get to see you swim…

255
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,779
sometime.

256
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:11,012
Minato-san.

257
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,972
About Sakuma-sensei.

258
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,101
Can you tell me more about him?

259
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,008
Sure.

260
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:33,852
Sakuma-sensei.

261
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,503
What's the matter, Akira-kun?

262
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,750
At last, you’re graduating, too.

263
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,844
You use to be such a rascal.

264
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,912
As your teacher, I’m glad.

265
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,373
Thank you for everything, Akira-kun.

266
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:01,287
For overcoming your injuries…

267
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,542
and being a great captain for the team.

268
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,863
Don't compliment me like that.

269
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:12,755
It gives me goosebumps.

270
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:16,769
You don't need to be shy.

271
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:25,401
When you go to Tokyo,

272
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:27,625
please continue to work hard.

273
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,594
Oh, boy.

274
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:59,070
What a bitter past.

275
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,553
That's not true.

276
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:16,605
You're amazing, Shin.

277
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,904
You’re able to confess your feelings,

278
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,127
and face others head-on.

279
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,572
And you're always
honest with yourself.

280
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,658
You're really...

281
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:45,186
You're really are…amazing.

282
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,893
You're completely different from me.

283
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,002
To me, you're far too dazzling.

284
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,166
Shin.

285
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:08,838
I'm delighted about how you feel

286
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,210
But you're just a high school kid.

287
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,349
You'll be meeting
lots of people in the future.

288
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:22,373
I'm sorry for not being clear before.

289
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,907
I can't be with you.

290
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,252
And if…

291
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,973
being with you like this
gets your hopes up…

292
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,927
then we shouldn’t be friends, either.

293
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,227
Let's not see each other anymore.

294
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,321
If you...

295
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,556
If you really hate me,
I'll accept it.

296
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:16,208
But that's not the case.

297
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,422
That's not the case, right,
Minato-san?

298
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:27,727
You...

299
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,839
I'm telling you this
for your future's sake.

300
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,107
No need for that.

301
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,891
You say it's for my sake.

302
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,795
But you're actually
protecting something else.

303
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:41,335
Just give me a break.

304
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:44,664
Adults have their own reasons.

305
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,744
I cannot be with you.

306
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:48,486
Rebel boy.

307
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,133
I told you not to grab me like that.

308
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:52,885
You must not understand.

309
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:56,037
I was so disturbed by the thought
that you're meeting someone you liked.

310
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:57,450
I could barely contain myself.

311
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:59,779
I told you I didn't get to meet him.

312
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:02,394
Right, you didn't.
But you wanted to, right?

313
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:03,763
Well...

314
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,766
Just get off me.

315
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,933
Did you…

316
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:12,037
Did you fantasize being with him here?

317
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:19,103
Please.

318
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,514
Stop it, I'm begging you.

319
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:24,783
How did you feel when you kissed him?
Were you happy?

320
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:27,648
Okay, I'll do anything.
Please, just stop it.

321
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:30,164
Will you really do anything?

322
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,765
You don’t let up, do you?

323
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,150
That’s actually funny.

324
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,409
That was close.

325
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:24,710
What are you doing?

326
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:27,220
I have to constantly be
on guard around you.

327
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:34,542
We should head back.
You might catch a cold.

328
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,136
You can dry your clothes at my place.

329
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,693
Is this an invitation?

330
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:42,485
Of course not.

331
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:45,331
Stop that, you’re so immature!

332
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
You’re going down!

333
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:53,811
(Suitable Level)

334
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:56,741
I thought we're going to your house.

335
00:22:56,828 --> 00:22:57,838
Shut up.

336
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:00,967
Shut up and read your comic.

337
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,933
By the way…

338
00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:13,464
You said something about ten years.

339
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,300
What did you mean by that?

340
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,667
I'm not telling you…

341
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:23,200
until you remember it yourself.

342
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:31,969
At Minato Shouji Coin Laundry,

343
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,265
No matter how tough the stain...

344
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,415
you can say goodbye to it.

(Next Episode)
You’re always taking it upon yourself…

350
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,064
Don't make that face.

351
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:55,161
(Shin's feelings make Minato...)
If only I can change you.

352
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,517
How are you so dazzling?

353
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,358
