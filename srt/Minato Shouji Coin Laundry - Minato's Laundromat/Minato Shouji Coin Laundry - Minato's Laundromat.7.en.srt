When the summer break starts,

3
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:09,818
my coaching at the swimming club begins.

4
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,250
That's the finish line.

5
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:15,854
That was fast.

7
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:22,356
Have you seen my mobile phone?

8
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,801
I don't seem to remember where I left it.

Oh, right.

12
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:35,302
I often lose my phone.

13
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,837
So, I decided to hang it here.

14
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,663
I completely forgot about it.

15
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,076
Nothing has changed

16
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:44,611

Recently,

23
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,027
I've been blessed

24
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:10,497
to have received so much love from so many students.

25
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:13,716

00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,256
Can you lower the temperature?

By the way, you guys...

28
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,428
should go home
since the practice ended early.

29
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:22,997
This isn't a place to hang out.

30
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:25,169
If you insist, do the laundry.

31
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,670
We have nothing to wash.
Plus, this place is shabby.

What did you just say?

33
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:32,552
You guys stink. Go wash up.

34
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,021
- Wash your shirt.
- No.

35
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,353
Shut up. Take it off.

36
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:36,456
No way.

You were trying to get them naked.

No, I wasn't.

I was at the library today.

51

So, I saw you at school.

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,218
It is fun.

And I don't want those guys
to regret it later, like I did.

58
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:56,369
So I think I can be their driving force.

86
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,089
mean?

87
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,802
I'm not telling you.

88
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,957
What? Why?

89
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,592
However, if you kiss me,

90
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,021
I may tell you.

91
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:29,006
That's crazy. I won't do it.

92
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,091
Then I'm not telling you.

93
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,766
Come on, tell me. You made me even more curious.

94
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,441
So be it.

95
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:38,773
Be so curious that you can't sleep at night.

96

Just keep thinking about me.

98
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,925

99

101

You're seriously a childish grownup.

102
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,957
Even your scolding made my day.

103
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,050
Shut up.

00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:21,279
Oh.

109
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,078
Please don't tell Shin.

110
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,321
It's a surprise party.

111
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:26,753
Shin's birthday?

112
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:31,997
He's turning 18.

113
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,097
He's still a kid.

114
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,365
(No available at the moment, Minato Akira)

115
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,826
May I help you?

116
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:16,559
Well...

117
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:20,299
I'm looking for a birthday present.

118
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,843
Is it for your girlfriend?

119
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,028
No.

120
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:26,864
It's...

121
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,852
It's for a high school boy.

122
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,992
Finally, I had to buy it.

123
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,227
But isn't the doll...

124
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,792
too cute?

125
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:49,298

132
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,855
I could naturally talk to him at school.

133
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,664
But when we're alone like this...

134
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,951
what should we talk about?

135
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,520
I really have no idea.

136
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,450
By the way,

137
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:25,322
I wonder what he thought

138
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,875
about the graduation day.

139
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,682
Is there something on my face?

140
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,003
No.

141
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,578
It's just...

142
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,412
Akira-kun.

143
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:43,523
You used to like it, didn't you?

144
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,656
The watermelon smoothie.

145
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,874
You always had it
on the way home from the club.

146
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,769
Yes.

147
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:55,330
So you still remember.

148
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:00,155
I really appreciate it that you agreed

149
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,189
to coach those kids.

150
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:05,164

Hey, Shin.

157
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,236
Did you have fun?

158
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:53,745
What do you mean?

159
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,282
You must cherish it so much.

160
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,573
What?

161
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,987
I saw you.

162
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:11,277
I saw you with Sakuma-Sensei.

163
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,060
I see.

164
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:15,410
Yes.

165
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,770
I went shopping and ran into him.

166
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:18,823
That's why...

167
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,822
you drank a watermelon shake so intimately?

168
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,769
Shin.

169
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,026
Have you forgotten

170
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:29,247
that promise?

171
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:31,264
The promise?

172
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:35,935
I'll treat you
to a watermelon smoothie next time.

173
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,037
Yes. Definitely a yes.

174
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,839
I'll hold on to that, Minato-san.

175
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,478
No, that's not it.

176
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,292
Sensei bought it for me when we met.

177
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,680
What did it taste like?

178
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,401
Is it sweet?

179
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,188
What's with you?

180
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,995
Don't get angry like a kid over this.

181
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,737
A kid?

182
00:10:58,567 --> 00:10:59,826
Exactly.

183
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:01,828
In your eyes,

184
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm just a kid.

185
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:05,999
Hey, Shin.

186
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,768
It's just one watermelon shake.

187
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,144
You shouldn't...

188
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:29,097
Hey. What's wrong with you?

189
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:30,349
I'm going home.

190
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,831
I don't know what I'll do if I stay.

191
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:36,840
- Are you crazy?
- The crazy one is you!

192
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,502
What's with him?

193
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,649
What should I do

194
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:58,451
about what happened yesterday?

195
00:11:58,755 --> 00:12:01,616
How am I going to face him today?

196
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,626
Oh, Akira-san. Good morning.

197
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,192
Hey.

198
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:10,663
Akira-san. You're seriously wandering.

199
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:16,148
Please, Asuka.

200
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,051
You gotta help me.

201
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,808
What?

202
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:23,209
Shin-nii, Happy birthday.

203
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:24,077
Happy birthday.

204
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:26,113
Happy birthday, Shin-chan.

205
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,048
Why is Hanabusa here too?

206
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:32,151
Come on, this is good.

207
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:35,154
Akira-san came to wish you a happy birthday.

208
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:36,899
You must be elated.

209
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:44,464
Shin.

210
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:46,467
Happy birthday.

211
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,413
Shin-nii, happy birthday.

212
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,302
Thanks, Yu.

213
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:58,975
It's so cute.

214
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:09,971
Wow, it's good.

215
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:12,725
You're very good at cooking, Sakurako-chan.

216
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,060
He's right. It's all delicious.

217
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,329
Really? Thank you very much.

218
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,497
Well,

219
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:20,033
I learned to cook all this food from Shin.

220
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,071
What's with you?
Why don't you guys talk?

221
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,117
How about the cake?

222
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,561
Oh, right, I'll get it.

223
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,388
Let me help.

224
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:43,531
Okay.

225
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,060
- Wait.
- Let's get the cake.

226
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:53,066
What's the matter with Shin and Minato-san?

227
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,001
I don't really know.

228
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:58,026
I have no idea what's wrong with them.

229
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,661
It's really nice

230
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:05,382
to have siblings.

231
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,815
It's really refreshing.

232
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:12,819
What's the matter?

233
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,139
Are you still mad about yesterday?

234
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,191
Oh, boy. I forgot to pick up the cake.

235
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,000
Asuka-san, let's go pick up the cake.

236
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:29,700
But the cake is here.

237
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,042
Right, I get it.

238
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,304
I'll come with you.

239
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:38,544
Thank you.

240
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,615
Shin, we'll be right back.

241
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,117
Stay here with Minato-san, okay?

242
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,745
- I can come with...
- No, you're the birthday boy.

243
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,073
Yes, you should stay here.

244
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:50,823
Wait...

245
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,296
Hey.

246
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:53,526
Asuka.

247
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:02,502
Well...

248
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:05,944
I'll pour it for you.

249
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,073
It's all right.

250
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:08,141
Let me.

251
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:09,342
It's all right.

252
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:11,282
I said I'll do it.

253
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:15,327
Sorry.

254
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:16,803
What are you trying to do?

255
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:18,785
Sorry.

256
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,315
Where are you going?

257
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,490
I'll take a shower.

258
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,944
You seem to care about your brother a lot.

259
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:37,835
Both of our parents have to work.

260
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,573
Since we were little,
Shin has always been the one

261
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,275
who takes care of us

262
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,076
and everything at home.

263
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:45,932
That's why...

264
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:48,915
I'd like to root for him and his love.

265
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,303
Is that so?

266
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:52,819
By the way,

267
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:55,407
you seem to be popular as well.

268
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,807
Me?

269
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:00,569
You're good-looking, kind,
and a good listener.

270
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:02,346
Well...

271
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:04,723
I always side with cute girls.

272
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,786
I have a question.

273
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:12,012
What do I have to do to attract an older guy?

274
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,850
Is this a love talk?

275
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,111
Do you have someone you like?

276
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:17,117
Yes.

277
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,613
He's my tutor. He's really cool.

278
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:21,781
Would you like to see the picture?

279
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:23,303
Okay. I'd love to.

280
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,335
It's this guy.

281
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,560
His name is Shuu-Sensei.

282
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:34,702
Asuka-san.

283
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:36,685
Oh, it's nothing.

284
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,694
Well, he's good-looking.

285
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,616
Isn't he cool?

286
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:44,257
What is this?

287
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:45,738
This atmosphere...

288
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,749
Wait.

289
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,358
Why is my heart racing?

290
00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:52,512
I gotta calm down.

291
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,144
Shin just got his clothes wet

292
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:57,239
and went to take a shower. That's all.

293
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:04,757
Hey!

294
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,842
Why aren't you wearing clothes?

295
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,765
My clothes are in my room.

296
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,522
Even so.

297
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,671
You said a naked body
of a high-schooler doesn't affect you.

298
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:21,574
Even so.

299
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,575
Just go and put on your clothes.

300
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:35,694
Minato-san.

301
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:42,101
I'm sorry about yesterday.

302
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,796
I shouldn't have gotten angry
over such a thing.

303
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,750
I know that was childish of me.

304
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:53,647
But...

305
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,276
For me,

306
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:59,432
that promise was very important.

307
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,316
I, too...

308
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,351
am sorry

309
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,255
for not thinking

310
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,991
about how you might feel.

311
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:15,861
And...

312
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:16,967
this...

313
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,167
It's not an apology gift.

314
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,241
But...

315
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,771
it's your birthday present.

316
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,435
Why a doll?

317
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,618
I didn't know else to get you.

318
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,389
It's not even cute.

319
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,499
What?

320
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,792
What do you mean? I think it's cute.

321
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,663
Thank you so much.

322
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:52,552
I'm glad you have a present for me.

323
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:55,366
I'll keep it as a family heirloom.

324
00:18:57,142 --> 00:18:58,610
You're exaggerating.

325
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,999
Just go and put on some clothes.

326
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:03,042
Go.

327
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:05,225
Okay.

328
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,678
Would you...

329
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,615
like to come with me

330
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,444
to my room?

331
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:22,568
What?

332
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,494
Why should I?

333
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,108
There's something I'd like you to see.

334
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:32,071
I mean...

335
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,452
the goal is so big.

336
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,941
That's right.

337
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,714
(Asuka: Are you free today?
I need to talk to you.)

338
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:03,969
This was...

339
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,296
me ten years ago.

340
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,178
Ten years ago.

341
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,264
Hey.

342
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:41,040
Are you all right?

343
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,876
Just hang in there.

344
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,115
What a relief.

345
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,444
You totally got me worried.

346
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,092
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:01,927
It's because of me.

348
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,163
Nonsense.

349
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,030
I'm fine.

350
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:08,780
I may not look like it,
but I'm the captain of a swimming club.

351
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,342
But your clothes...

352
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:14,527
Don't worry about it.

353
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:17,503
I can have it dry in ten minutes
at my Grandpa's Laundromat.

354
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,414
I mean Minato Shouji Coin Laundry.

355
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,436
You probably don't know of it.

356
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,955
Let's just say...

357
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:32,444
you gotta be more careful from now on.

358
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,427
It's dangerous
to go into the sea alone like that.

359
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,506
I'm really sorry.

360
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:46,467
It's okay now.

361
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,081
So the kid at that time...

362
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:57,798
was you?

363
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:00,853
Minato-san.

364
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:04,266
You are my first love.

365
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,729
For the past ten years,

366
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,632
you've been on my mind.

367
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,108
No matter how I try,
I can't get you out of my head.

368
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:21,015
I want to see you.

369
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,491
So that day,

370
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,882
when I met you again at the coin laundry,

371
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:34,193
I was so thrilled.

372
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,668
I thought...

373
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,138
I've used up all my luck.

374
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,522
That's what I thought.

375
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:00,257
Minato-san.

376
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:02,381
I'm eighteen now.

377
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,185
I'm no longer a kid.

378
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,173
So can you...

379
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,758
please look at me?

380
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:17,696
Not as a kid or a highschooler.

381
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:20,866
But as a man.

382
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:32,011
Please be my boyfriend.

383
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,827
Please continue to support us next week.

384
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:45,526
(Next Episode)

385
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,019
(Feelings over the past ten years)
Shin can always...

386
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:49,121
(Feelings over the past ten years)
face everything head-on.

387
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:50,756
I like you so much that I can't hold it in.

388
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,757
Minato-san.

389
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,858
(The cause of poor academic performance)
If this keeps going,

390
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:54,401
getting into the college you want

391
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:56,095
is going to be difficult.

392
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,663
I've thought long and hard

393
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,687
(This drama is fictional.)
about you, and I think...
