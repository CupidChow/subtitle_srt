00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,669
Chief.

5
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,430
Beautiful.

6
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,010
Really beautiful.

7
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,790
What's beautiful about her?

8
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,840
Chief Xue is graceful and elegant.

9
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,510
You don't know how to appreciate beauty,

10
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,110
but I do.

11
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,940
She's a woman worth pursuing.

12
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,340
I absolutely cannot let her down.

13
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,350
What's wrong?

14
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,760
What are you doing? Hey.

15
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
I still have things to do.

16
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,470
What are you doing?

17
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,650
Look at you.

18
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,230
You want to repeat your old mistakes again?

19
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,120
Those people who you promised

20
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,150
to never let down

21
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,310
have all been let down in the end.

are known to everyone in the martial world.

25
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,430
Why are you mentioning him?

26
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,710
Don't compare me to that old man

27

28
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,290
I'm still young and handsome.

29

Fine.

30
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,950
I wonder who it was

31
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,190
who was obsessed with

32
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,630
Miss Liu Feifei, the top courtesan in Yangzhou, just a few months ago,

33
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,590
and now has fallen for Chief Xue

34
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,450
at first sight.

35
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,960
Let me warn you.

36
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,930
Don't mess with Chief Xue.

37
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,150
If you offend her,

38
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,750
you'll be in trouble.

39
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,550
What if I insist on pursuing her?

40
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,250
Your tricks won't work on her.

41
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,570
She's cold-hearted,

42
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,170
you know?

43
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,870
Seven.

44
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,750
Some women may seem cold on the outside,

45
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,950
always keeping people at arm's length,

46
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,910
but in fact,

47
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,680
they're warm on the inside.

48
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,149
Chief Xue

49
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,680
will surely be moved

50
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,640
by my sincerity.

51
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,270
Good luck to you then.

52
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,470
Seven.

53
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,270
Do you know what Chief Xue likes to do

54
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,270
in her daily life?

55
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,680
So what if I know?

56
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm sorry, okay?

57
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,230
Just tell me, please.

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,340
You are really unbelievable.

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,380
Well, as for Chief Xue,

60
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,030
she collects Rootless Water every day.

61
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,070
When there are patients coming in for treatment,

62
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,350
she treats them.

63
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,680
When she's free,

64
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,750
she takes Ms. Shuang Hong and the others

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,030
to practice acupuncture,

66
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,360
or reads medical books.

67
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,830
Oh, right.

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,550
They also go to the Winter Hall

69
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,950
to drink wine and warm up.

70
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,920
This kind of simple life

71
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
seems to match

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,550
Chief Xue's tranquil temperament well.

I seriously warn you.

Chief Xue is a person who values rules highly.

76

Don't overstep your bounds.

Don't worry.

Hurry up.

106
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,790
I'll show you.

107

You don't know anything usually.

108
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,310
Let me tell you.

109
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,750
Study hard.

110

Chief Xue.

112

This gold floral hairpin

113

was specially commissioned by me from skilled craftsmen

114
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,350
to be crafted for you, Chief Xue.

115

for your taste, Chief Xue.

117

The craftsmanship of this gold floral hairpin is remarkable.

118
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,910
Was it made by

119
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,380
Master Su, the goldsmith from Jiangnan?

120
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,310
It's said that any piece

121
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,430
made by Master Su

122
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,150
can sell for tens of thousands of taels of gold.

123
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,680
It's not worth mentioning.

124
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,870
Do you like it, Chief Xue?

125
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,870
If you like it,

126
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,910
I'll have Master Su craft a few more,

127
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,870
so that you can wear a different one

128

every day.

129
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,710
Mr. Xia, you aren't busy now, right?

130
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,440
No, not busy.

131
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,750
What can I do for you, Chief Xue?

132
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,679
Please go ahead.

133
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,380
Follow me.

134

Okay.

I...

138
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,470
I have something to get.

139
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,470
Come get it later.

140
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,680
She closed the door?

141
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,520
Chief Xue, so you took me here to...

142
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,650
Please sit.

143
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,150
Mr. Xia, recently,

144
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,400
you've brought many valuables to Apothecary Valley.

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,560
As long as it pleases you, Chief Xue.

146
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,790
I heard from Feng Lyu

147
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,270
that on the day you entered the valley, you said

148
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,430
you would pay the medical fees for your seventh brother.

149
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,270
Is that true?

150
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,990
It is.

151
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,890
A virtuous person should acquire wealth in an upright and just way.

152
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,410
I can't just accept

153
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,350
so many gifts

154
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,100
from you for no reason, Mr. Xia.

[Apothecary Valley, Clinic Record]

156
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,150
Here's the debt your seventh brother

157
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,550
has incurred in Apothecary Valley over the years.

158
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,750
The money you spent

159
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,010
will be regarded as paying off your seventh brother's debt.

160
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,300
But that's not why I...

161
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,480
But that's why

162
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,470
I allowed you

163
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,130
to stay in Apothecary Valley.

164
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,670

165
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,870
and praised it...

166
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,960
I simply meant

167
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,630
the jade pendant at your waist

168
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,760

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,750
as well as daily medication costs,

176
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,950
food expenses, and lodging fees.

177
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,480
The total sum amounts to...

178
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,350
Are the money and the gold hairpin not enough?

179
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,410
Right. Not enough.

180
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,570
How much does Seven actually owe?

181
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,030
Mr. Xia, please sign here.

182
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,470
This way, Seven's debt

183
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,340
will be transferred to you.

184
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,010
Sign?

185
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,560
It seems Seven was right.

186
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,390
I failed to see through

187
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,790
you after all, Chief Xue.

188
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,440
But this doesn't mean

189
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,120
I'll give up just like that.

190
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,830
Chief Xue.

191
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,030
See you.

192
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,590
You're drinking alone, yet you've opened so many jars of wine.

193
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,920
Can you finish them all?

194
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,510
I can't.

195
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,630
Why don't you, Chief Xue,

196
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,690
join me for a drink?

197
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,940
You opened the wine,

198
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,630
so you should deal with it yourself.

199
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,230
Then I'll have to take away what I can't finish.

200
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,250
Your plotting

201
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,740
is quite clever, isn't it?

202
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,430
That depends on who you're comparing it with.

203
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,110
Chief Xue.

204
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,740
You've come at the right time.

205
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,200
Taste this wine yourself.

206
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,030
Why does it taste bitter?

207
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,060
Could it be that since I haven't paid for the wine,

208
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,890
your Apothecary Valley

209
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,550
stopped serving me good wine?

210
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,830
So you know

211
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,310
you haven't paid, Mr. Huo?

212
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,070
You should be grateful to have any wine at all.

213
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,730
Yet you're still being picky.

214
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,430
That gold floral hairpin doesn't suit you.

215
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,070
Is that so?

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,850
But I think

217
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,140
it suits me quite well.

218
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,560
Gold material is gaudy.

219
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,120
You deserve better.

220
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,750
Then, Mr. Huo, do tell me

221
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,120
what kind of hairpin

222
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,140
would suit me.

223
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,550
A white jade hairpin.

224
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
As white as snow, as bright as clouds, and as lustrous as the moon.

225
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Natural yet not vulgar.

226
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,920
Preferably in the shape of a plum blossom.

227
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,350
Blooming in the cold,

228
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,840
with its own integrity.

229
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,930
The jade hairpin is polished,

230
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,830
while the winter plum endures wind and snow.

231
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,760
Both are elegant and noble things.

232
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,520
Don't move.

233
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Now it's fitting.

234
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,470
Seven.

235
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,710
Chief Xue.

236
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,030
You've opened so many jars of wine.

237
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,190
Can you finish them all?

238
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,590
I happen to be in the mood for some, too.

239
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,520
Fourth Brother.

240
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,730
It's getting late.

241
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,190
You should go back and rest early.

242
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,230
I'm not sleepy. If you want to leave, you go.

243
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,690
I've never had a drink with Chief Xue before.

244
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,110
Chief Xue!

245
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,590
You want to drink, right?

246
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,280
Let's go, I'll drink with you.

247
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,570
Never mind.

248
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,670
Let's go back and sleep.

249
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,470
Weren't you not sleepy earlier?

250
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,340
That was then.

251
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,560
Chief Xue was still here earlier.

252
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,090
How can it be the same as now?

253
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,390
Look at you.

254
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,990
There's good wine, but you don't want to drink it,

255
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,990
insisting on drinking tea instead.

256
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,750
As for tea,

257
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,510
the more you drink, the more awake you become.

258
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,910
But when it comes to wine,

259
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,480
the more you drink, the more confused you get.

260
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,270
By the way,

261
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,260
you know

262
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,670
the rules of Apothecary Valley.

263
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,870
Except for patients,

264
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,870
no one is allowed to stay overnight.

265
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,750
You've been in the valley

266
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,710
for a while now.

267
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,190
When do you plan to leave?

268
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,910
Chief Xue hasn't asked me to leave yet.

269
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,370
Why are you in such a hurry?

270
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,230
I...

271
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,680
But now that you mention it,

272
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,860
Chief Xue

273
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
has broken

274
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,520
the valley's rules for me, hasn't she?

275
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,950
What do you think?

276
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,350
I think she has.

277
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,290
I've had enough.

278
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,670
If I drink too much,

279
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,470
I won't be able to sleep at night.

280
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,510
As for me,

281
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,010
I can sleep no matter what I drink.

282
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,520
Chief Xue.

283
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,540
Chief Xue.

284
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,350
Chief Xue.

285
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,150
Chief Xue.

286
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,790
You're so beautiful.

287
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,730
Seven.

288
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,150
How did I fall down?

289
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,200
Fourth Brother.

290
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,750
How did you get down there?

291
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,670
I don't know.

292
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,819
You must have had a nightmare.

293
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,230
A nightmare?

294
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,630
That can't be.

295
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,819
I was dreaming about Chief Xue.

296
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,350
Three catties and two taels.

297
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,030
Chief.

298
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,950
All this gold added together

299
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,030
isn't enough for the 200,000 medical fee.

300
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,190
Less than 200,000.

301
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,590
Our Apothecary Valley's

302
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,250
daily expenses for everyone,

303
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,200
plus the expenses of us sending medicine and doing check-ups

304
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,630
for the villagers nearby on  the first and fifteenth of each month

305
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,910
and every solar term,

306
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,470
as well as the costs of running the orphanage,

307
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,270
and the expenses of sending those

308
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,070
grown children

309
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,800
to school for their education.

310
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,270
When you add it all up, it's not nearly enough.

311
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,070
I knew the amount wasn't enough.

312
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,230
Chief.

313
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,470
This is said to be very valuable.

314
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,310
Perhaps

315
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,350
its value is comparable to that of

316
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,350
the jade pendant on Mr. Xia's waist.

317
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,670
Does Mr. Xia already know

318
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,850
that all this gold has been used

319
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,380
to pay off Mr. Seven's debt?

320
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,270
I've already told him.

321
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,680
Who's that?

322
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,170
It's me.

323
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,390
Good evening.

324
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,350
Sorry to disturb you ladies.

325
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,600
You've come at the right time.

326
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,550
Your Fourth Brother has

327
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,010
paid off part of your debt.

328
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,070
From now on,

329
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,880
you'll have two creditors.

330
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,910
Great.

331
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,410
That's wonderful.

332
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,840
Why are you smiling?

333
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,390
You're not...

334
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,030
Not what?

335
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,030
You're not

336
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,370
thinking about smashing the pot since it's already cracked,

337
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,630
are you? Giving yourself up completely?

338
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,770
Indeed I am.

339
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,730
Chief Xue, you're truly perceptive.

340
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,350
I see the moon is bright and the breeze is cool.

341
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,990
If we could drink under the moonlight,

342
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,990
that would be even more delightful.

343
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,990
Today's wine

344
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,470
tastes right.

345
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,190
Your alcohol tolerance

346
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,670
is not what it used to be.

347
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,230
You've only had a few sips,

348
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,890
and you're already like this.

349
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,680
This wine

350
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,690
is clearly the same as before.

351
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,350
Today's wine

352
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,320
is especially delicious.

353
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,840
Chief Xue.

354
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,390
I've never asked you before.

355
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,350
Why do you particularly love this Laughing at the World?

356
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,350
When I was 14, I fell into an icy river

357
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,730
and caught a chill.

358
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,950
That's why my lungs have never been in good condition.

359
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,150
The wine of Apothecary Valley

360
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,710
is made with the finest medicinal ingredients,

361
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,840
carefully crafted.

362
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,010
Master had me drink a bottle daily

363
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,630
to invigorate the blood, clear the meridians,

364
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,630
warm the lungs, and dispel the cold.

365
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,370
But that young man under the ice

366
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,390
fell into the icy river with you.

367
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,950
You probably rarely leave the valley, right?

368
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,090
Given the chance, let me take you to the Central Plains

369
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,550
to broaden your horizons,

370
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,230
so you won't doubt

371
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,760
my reputation as Mr. Seven.

372
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,690
I originally came from the Central Plains.

373
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,070
So there are also

374
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,110
heroic figures like you in the Central Plains,

375
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,030
Chief Xue.

376
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,350
What?

377
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,270
Trying to get information out of me?

378
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,790
No.

379
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,490
I just wanted to see

380
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,510
if there's anything I can do to help you.

381
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,430
Is it to repay the favor I did you

382
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,890
in the White Cloud Palace?

383
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,750
Do you think everyone in the world

384
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,790
is like you,

385
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,950
loving to have everything

386
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,150
calculated clearly?

387
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,270
I don't like owing others,

388
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,520
nor do I like others owing me.

389
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,950
You don't need to help me with anything.

390
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,030
Just pay off the rest of

391
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,190
the medical fees you owe Apothecary Valley

392
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,310
in full.

393
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,690
In Apothecary Valley,

394
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,870
there are many people waiting to be fed.

395
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,330
This...

396
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,650
Since you're so greedy for money,

397
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,230
why do you only treat

398
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,360
ten patients a year?

399
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,700
My body can't handle more.

400
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,990
Besides,

401
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,990
I don't like those people of the martial world.

402
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,350
Those who waste their lives

403
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,680
on meaningless battles

404
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,190
are not worth saving.

405
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,630
I'd rather

406
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,430
spend this time

407
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,990
treating people with colds and fevers

408
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,780
in nearby villages.

409
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,680
Then,

410
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,950
why did you save me?

411
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,330
Well...

412
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,990
Of course it was because your face

413
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,050
still has some redeeming qualities.

414
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,430
There are so many women in the valley.

415
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,030
It's quite boring, isn't it?

416
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,750
You and I have

417
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,190
been through life and death together, haven't we?

418
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,430
We haven't shared a drink yet.

419
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:42,700
♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

420
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,830
Here.

421
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,400
I prefer to drink alone.

422
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:50,390
♫Plum blossoms are about to fall; I'll see you here♫

423
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,230
♫Why are you late and why is it about to snow again?♫

424
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,460
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

425
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,560
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

426
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,780
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

427
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,630
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

428
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,460
Huo Zhanbai?

429
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,320
Huo Zhanbai?

430
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,140
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

431
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,250
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

432
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:08,460
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

433
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,890
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

434
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:26,640
♫Longing etched in my heart, but I don't wish for your acknowledgement of my love♫

435
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:34,100
♫Asking the stars about our fate, as fireworks appearing in my dream♫

436
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,510
♫I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with you♫

437
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,590
Why is Mr. Seven

438
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,590
lying here?

439
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,770
Don't tell me

440
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,170
he slept here last night.

441
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,830
[Sword Sect]

442
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,380
Years ago, all the major martial sects of the Central Plains

443
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,580
joined forces to attack Yuan Yi Palace.

444
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,350
The Seven Star Sword Formation led by Tiancheng

445
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,410
played a crucial role in that battle.

446
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,590
Now, Yuan Yi Palace has been hiding in

447
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,510
West Kunlun for many years.

448
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,230
How could Tiancheng

449
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,030
be so foolish

450
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,150
as to go to such an evil place?

451
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,670
If it weren't for Yuan Yi Palace's coercion and enticement,

452
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,130
Tiancheng wouldn't have ended up like this.

453
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,770
I have come here this time,

454
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,790
hoping that you

455
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,070
can lend me a hand

456
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,910
to thoroughly investigate this matter

457
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,630
and find the real culprit, Chief.

458
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,560
Actually, regarding this matter,

459
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,400
I already have some clues.

460
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,090
What clues do you have?

461
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,030
Xingzhi.

462
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,630
Chief Lin.

463
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,650
Take a look at this.

464
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,510
The Wuji Sect also got ambushed?

465
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,510
The victim was also

466
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,310
an important figure in the sect.

467
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,070
Although Chief Leng of Wuji Sect

468
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,710
escaped death,

469
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,690
he was seriously injured.

470
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,190
Judging from this,

471
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,790
there must be someone behind the scenes

472
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,710
systematically harming

473
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,790
the martial artists of the Central Plains.

474
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,990
Senior Qin Tiancheng

475
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,670
was definitely not killed by Seventh Brother.

476
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,390
I was rash

477
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,030
in this matter.

478
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,960
Regarding the matter of Zhanbai,

479
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,160
Chief Lin, you needn't take it to heart.

480
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,190
He took your sect's sacred Azure Phoenix Flower without asking for your permission,

481
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,030
so he deserves to suffer a bit.

482
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,040
However, regarding Tiancheng's murder,

483
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,510
in my opinion,

484
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,910
it may be

485
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,420
related to Yuan Yi Palace.

486
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,010
According to reliable information,

487
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,350
Chang Wujue seemed to have only

488
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,590
sent out Miao Huo,

489
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,920
but in fact, there was another person.

490
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,620
The Asura Field in Yuan Yi Palace

491
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,150
is where Chang Wujue

492
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,530
trains assassins.

493
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,590
The Five Sages by his side

494
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,960
all come from there.

495
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,870
A few years ago, there appeared

496
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,750
a so-called once-in-a-century

497
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,950
top assassin, named Eye.

498
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,710
If Zhanbai had already lured Miao Huo

499
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,510
to a secluded alley at that time,

500
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,970
then the real culprit who impersonated Zhanbai

501
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,280
and murdered Tiancheng

502
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,270
is very likely to be Eye.

503
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,270
You're right, Chief.

504
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,670
The Seven Star Sword Formation

505
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,130
is the foundation of our White Cloud Palace.

506
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,750
With Tiancheng dead,

507
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,960
the Seven Star Sword Formation...

508
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,950
Those scoundrels from Yuan Yi Palace

509
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,950
are truly cunning and treacherous.

510
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,270
I must storm West Kunlun

511
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,770
and grind their bones to dust.

512
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,190
Chief Lin, please be patient.

513
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,830
This is merely my speculation.

514
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,270
For so many years,

515
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,870
Yuan Yi Palace has never invaded the Central Plains.

516
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,070
If this was truly done by Yuan Yi Palace,

517
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,810
then they must have planned it meticulously

518
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,630
to make sure it was impeccable.

519
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,630
Therefore, we must not act rashly.

520
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,450
We need to carefully consider our next move.

521
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,790
What you said is absolutely right, Chief.

522
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,340
Chief.

523
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,430
Do you have any good plans?

524
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,470
This requires all the righteous martial sects

525
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,630
to work together

526
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,070
and unite as one.

527
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,190
Chief Qiushui of the Celestial Alp Sect

528
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,320
is highly respected

529
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,170
and has great prestige in the martial world.

530
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:23,990
Xingzhi.

531
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,360
When Qianyu is back,

532
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,030
you two make a quick run

533
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,590
to the Celestial Alp Sect

534
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,730
and invite Chief Qiushui to come here and discuss

535
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,990
our countermeasures.

536
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:31,960
Yes.

537
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,890
The martial world

538
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,050
has been peaceful for many years.

539
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm afraid

540
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,470
another bloodshed

541
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,140
is about to take place.

542
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,990
Doctrine Leader.

543
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,230
Doctrine Leader.

544
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,270
Doctrine Leader.

545
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,190
You're back.

546
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,310
I failed to keep you safe, Doctrine Leader.

547
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,310
Please punish me, Doctrine Leader.

548
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,880
This is not your fault.

549
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,750
I was too eager

550
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,160
and practiced on my own.

551
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,710
If you hadn't returned in time,

552
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,230
I might have gone berserk.

553
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,690
It seems that to break through the ninth level

554
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,910
of the Iron Horse Glacier mental technique,

555
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,750
your Spring Breeze technique

556
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,870
is indispensable.

557
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,910
I'm willing to always be by your side, Doctrine Leader.

558
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,150
I'm at your disposal.

559
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,910
Mr. Seven.

560
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,480
Do you feel any discomfort?

561
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,110
I feel very good.

562
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,030
I'm ready to set out

563
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,290
and find the next herb.

564
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,430
Hold it.

565
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,940
If you can hold it

566
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,030
for 30 minutes,

567
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,010
I'll let you leave the valley.

568
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,810
No problem.

569
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,150
Right hand.

570
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,510
I'll just

571
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,690
take medicine for a few more days.

572
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,130
It's not a problem.

573
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,440
Shuang Hong.

574
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,990
Give him a few more doses of medicine

575
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,850
according to this prescription.

576
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,310
Chief!

577
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,750
Chief!

578
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,230
Go to the Winter Hall and have a look.

579
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,760
Mr. Xia made a huge mistake.

580
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,590
These peonies are medicinal herbs.

581
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,190
Why did you pull them all out?

582
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,110
Miss Feng Lyu.

583
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,750
I didn't know they were used for medicine.

584
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,230
I just thought they looked pretty, so I picked them.

585
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,930
How much are they worth?

586
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,510
I'll pay.

587
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,470
We were going to decoct medicine with the peonies.

588
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,530
Can money be used to decoct medicine?

589
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,270
This is indeed my fault.

590
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll make amends, alright?

591
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,310
Chief Xue.

592
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,070
Chief.

593
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,950
Since you want to make amends,

594
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,280
don't just stand there.

595
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,320
Whatever you order, Chief Xue.

596
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,270
Since Mr. Xia has caused trouble,

597
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,270
you two brothers,

598
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,830
go and pick some herbs

599
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,100
to make up for it.

600
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,110
It was Fourth Brother's fault.

601
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,770
What does it have to do with me?

602
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,670
Have you forgotten

603
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,530
how much you owe for medical fees?

604
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,530
I'm still injured.

605
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,710
Your shoulder is injured,

606
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,800
but your legs are fine.

607
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,530
Walking more

608
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,890
will help you recover.

609
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,020
Don't come back to the valley

610
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,220
until you fill your baskets with herbs.

611
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,950
Seven.

612
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,140
Are you sure this is the right path?

613
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,400
Can we find herbs here?

614
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,190
There's a grove up ahead.

615
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,470
Let's go check there.

616
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,510
I just thought I'd pick a bouquet of flowers

617
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,430
to give to Chief Xue

618
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,860
as soon as she came out of her room.

619
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,730
I didn't expect

620
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,100
to cause such trouble.

621
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,600
On this land of ice and snow,

622
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,920
where can I possibly find flowers?

623
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,960
Fourth Brother.

624
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,150
Even if you picked flowers,

625
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,810
Chief Xue wouldn't like them.

626
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,230
So I advise you

627
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,990
to stop this matter right here.

628
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,840
What matter do you mean?

629
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,920
Trying to please Chief Xue.

630
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,350
Why?

631
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,330
You don't know her.

632
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,150
That woman

633
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,080
has her own principles.

634
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,710
Her likes and dislikes are unpredictable, and her temper is odd.

635
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,230
It's very hard to please her.

636
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,830
Moreover,

637
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,270
she doesn't always say what she means.

638
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,590
She often says one thing

639
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,750
but does another.

640
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,130
Most importantly,

641
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,380
she's too willful and arbitrary.

642
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,840
She's not suitable for you, Fourth Brother.

643
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,430
All these years,

644
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,310
you should've spent most of your time

645
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,230
traveling outside to find herbs, right?

646
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,710
Why do you seem

647
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,540
to know Chief Xue so well?

648
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,210
We haven't spent much time together,

649
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,470
but we've been through some life-and-death situations.

650
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,330
Naturally, I've gained some understanding of her.

651
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,760
But the Chief Xue in your eyes

652
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,110
is very different from

653
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,070
the one I know.

654
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,670
Just this time,

655
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,350
when White Cloud Palace chased us to Apothecary Valley,

656
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,500
what Chief Xue did

657
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,150
shows that she is someone

658
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,040
who values reason and loyalty.

659
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,840
Fourth Brother.

660
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,890
Why can't you listen to my advice?

661
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,070
What a fool.

662
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,530
Who are you calling a fool?

663
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,150
Seven.

664
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,630
Do you know

665
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,130
when the iron tree blooms?

666
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,110
The iron tree?

667
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,710
During my years of traveling in the martial world,

668
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,830
I've indeed seen

669
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,110
many iron trees.

670
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,630
Some bloom in summer,

671
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,350
while others bloom in autumn.

672
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,150
Depending on their location,

673
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,010
they bloom in different seasons.

674
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,400
You're really a blockhead in romance.

675
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,750
In that case,

676
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,110
I'll return to the Sword Sect tomorrow.

677
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
You... You're giving up so quickly?

678
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,350
You've been trying to persuade me for such a long time.

679
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,480
If I still don't take your advice,

680
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
wouldn't that be insensitive of me?

681
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,660
I'll go over there to look for herbs

682
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,790
and take another good look at the scenery in this valley.

683
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,300
A blockhead in romance...

684
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,010
Was that an insult?

685
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,230
Xiao Jing.

686
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,470
Come here.

687
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,190
Chief.

688
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,910
The tea from the snowy mountain

689
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,630
is indeed more crisp and refreshing.

690
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,190
Is it?

691
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,400
I didn't taste any difference.

692
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,890
It seems you ladies are in a good mood.

693
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,630
Mr. Huo.

694
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,150
Chief Xue, please take a good look.

695
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,470
Is this basket of medicinal herbs

696
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,930
enough to pay off the debt?

697
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,390
The quantity is sufficient,

698
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,590
but it still depends on quality.

699
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,360
Miss Xiao Cheng.

700
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,000
Please give me a cup of hot tea.

701
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,750
Chief?

702
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,690
Five taels.

703
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:33,850
Five taels.

704
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,280
No.

705
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,270
Ten taels.

706
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,470
Ten taels.

707
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,360
Ten taels it is then.

708
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,810
Put it on my tab.

709
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,360
Three taels?

710
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,510
I, the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect,

711
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,950
the only son of the Huashan Sect Leader,

712
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,970
known in the martial world as

713
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,510
White Feather Sword, Xia Qianyu,

714
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,070
worked so hard

715
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,310
gathering herbs for four hours,

716
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,590
and they're only worth three taels?

717
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,390
Indeed.

718
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,670
Who would have thought

719
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,100
that the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect,

720
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,490
the only son of the Huashan Sect Leader,

721
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,430
known in the martial world as

722
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,880
White Feather Sword, Xia Qianyu,

723
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Young Master Xia,

724
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,550
worked hard for four hours

725
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,490
and gathered only useless weeds?

726
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,670
Only a few are actually useful,

727
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,800
and it takes my discerning eyes

728
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,130
to pick them out for you.

729
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,240
Three taels is actually generous.

730
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,200
Three taels?

731
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,320
When I drink outside,

732
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,270
I casually give the servants tips

733
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,530
more than this amount.

734
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,360
Chief, dinner is ready.

735
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,190
Time to eat.

736
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,320
Tomorrow, I'll send a letter

737
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,990
to my father,

738
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,120
asking him to send a cart of herbs here.

739
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,000
Seven.

740
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,190
Stop eating.

741
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,550
Come on, let's go back to our room.

742
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,580
The sweet potatoes are freshly baked.

743
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,150
They're still hot.

744
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,990
And they're free.

745
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,070
I have something important to talk to you.

746
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:50,600
Let's go.

747
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,030
I'll get one for you.

748
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,960
I don't want any.

749
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,820
Sit down. Sit down.

750
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,230
What's so urgent?

751
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,310
You seem to be in such a hurry.

752
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,470
No, thanks.

753
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,910
After we parted ways,

754
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,390
do you know where I went?

755
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,920
I went to the back of the mountain.

756
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,590
At the back of the mountain,

757
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,990
there are many cenotaphs standing.

758
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,990
Did you know that?

759
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:14,910
In this desolate mountain,

760
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,640
it's normal to have cenotaphs.

761
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,550
But what if the cenotaphs are

762
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,010
for over a hundred people?

763
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,510
Besides, the person who set those cenotaphs up

764
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,470
was Chief Xue.

765
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,910
On New Year's Eve of the fourth year of Huijia,

766
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,350
over a hundred villagers

767
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,150
all died on the same day.

768
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,270
There must be something fishy about this.

769
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,030
I think

770
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,760
you should go and check.

771
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,710
Maybe we

772
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,770
can be of some help.

773
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,430
127 villagers

774
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,110
of Mo Family Village

775
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,550
died on New Year's Eve of the fourth year of Huijia.

776
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,440
Respectfully set up by Xue Ziye

777
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,320
in mid-spring of the fifth year of Huijia.

778
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,850
Mo Family Village?

779
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,710
Is this the village where Chief Xue

780
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,230
used to live?

781
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,950
[Mo Family Village]

782
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,150
Such an atrocious crime.

783
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,550
Who could have committed it?
