4
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,750
Master.

5
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,670
Zhan Bai.

6
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,230
Senior.

7
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,430
You're awake.

8
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,030
Junior.

9
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,090
How's your injury?

10
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,710
Did it hurt your organs?

11
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,270
Master, don’t worry.

12
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,310
Chief Xue has excellent medical skills.

13
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,910
I'll be fine after some rest.

14
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,670
Okay.

15
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,630
Mr. Huo,

16
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,430
happy chatting.

17
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,630
We'll take our leave.

18
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,870
Mo.

19
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,030
Come.

20
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,900
Give me a hug.

21
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,350
Here.

22
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,700
You got heavier, didn't you?

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,760
Do you remember me?

24
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,750
Yes.

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,910
You do?

26
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,550
You said you would teach me swordsmanship.

27
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,230
Sure.

28
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,990
After I recover,

29
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,370
I'll teach you swordsmanship, okay?

30
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,030
Okay.

31
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,200
Mo, let me carry you.

32
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,680
Here.

33
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,730
Your uncle hasn’t recovered yet.

34
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,630
Chief Xue.

35
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,640
Chief Qiushui, what are you doing?

36
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,310
I'm here to thank you

37
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,150
for saving Zhanbai.

38
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,110
Mo too,

39
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,550
survived

40
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,990
thanks to your

41
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,520
amazing skills.

42
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,300
Chief Xue,

43
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,390
please accept my bow.

44
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,890
You don't have to be so polite.

45
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,270
Mrs. Qiushui and Mo

46
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,630
came here with 100,000 medical fees

47
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,290
and the Fate-Reversal Token.

48
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,490
It was only natural

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,880
that I tended to him.

50
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,910
As for me and Huo Zhanbai,

51
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,030
that's

52
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,280
between us.

53
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,550
Chief Qiushui, you seem to cough a lot.

54
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,120
Did you catch a cold?

55
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,160
It's an old illness.

56
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,650
Chief Qiushui,

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,390
please.

58
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,930
Chief Qiushui, your cough

59
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,190
has been a chronic disease for many years.

60
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,650
I may not be able to cure it.

61
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,500
Even you

62
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,830
say it’s incurable.

63
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,360
There must be no cure.

64
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,830
Your cough is caused by

65
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,150
chronic depression hurting the liver.

66
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,680
The flow of energy is obstructed

67
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,990
and the crucial organs are not functioning well,

68
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,390
resulting in poor circulation.

69
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,190
When you're channeling energy,

70
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,450
they cannot reach the ends of your limbs.

71
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,350
No wonder.

72
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,680
Sometimes, halfway into my practice,

73
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,909
my lower body would suddenly feel light

74
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,790
and weak.

75
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,270
Even when I was clear-headed,

76
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,030
I couldn't move my body at all.

77
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,270
The imbalance in the wood, fire, and metal elements

78
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,550
often results in coughing

79
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,880
and signs of agitation.

80
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,300
But in fact,

81
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,380
there's something in your heart

82
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,560
bothering you for a long time.

83
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,470
Humans have seven emotions.

84
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,130
When emotions shift, the meridians change.

85
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,270
Chief Qiushui, you have great martial arts skills.

86
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,270
But your pulse at the left pass is deep, wiry, and thin.

87
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,790
It's due to long-term worries and overthinking

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,040
clogging your heart.

89
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,510
After years,

90
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,990
it became an illness.

91
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,409
Perhaps you're right.

92
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,030
As the head of Celestial Alp Sect,

93
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,140
I worry about the external peace

94
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,740
and Yuan Yi Palace's threat.

95
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,230
Internally,

96
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,790
I have to think about

97
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,630
choosing the next chief.

98
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,190
As Yin's father,

99
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,540
I still have to worry about who she can depend on

100
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,550
for the rest of her life.

101
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,430
The most urgent matter now

102
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,550
is Mo’s illness.

103
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,110
In the past years,

104
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,300
every time I saw him,

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,490
he looked more haggard.

106
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,000
Later,

107
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,950
I'll prepare some medicine

108
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,790
for you.

109
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,950
Although the medicine can relieve your mood, ease the liver,

110
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,830
and strengthens your energy circulation,

111
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,550
it can't cure the problem.

112
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,110
Chief Qiushui,

113
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,310
you should resolve the knot in your heart as soon as possible.

114
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,920
Otherwise, the stagnation and blood stasis

115
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,910
will get worse

116
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,690
and affect your power.

117
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,310
Okay.

118
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,030
Chief Xue.

119
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,510
Thank you for your guidance.

120
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,540
Goodbye.

121
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,110
No wonder Seven is like this.

122
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,550
The disciple really takes after

123
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,640
his master.

124
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,950
Mo is four years old.

125
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,560
But he looks

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
weaker and thinner than

127
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,160
the average two-year-old.

128
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,820
We need to gather

129
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,680
all the herbs as soon as possible.

130
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,630
This way,

131
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,390
Mo can recover soon.

132
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,430
Master.

133
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,150
Don't worry.

134
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,700
I will find all five herbs

135
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,830
as soon as possible.

136
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,110
I'll gather the remaining

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,150
two herbs with you.

138
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,350
Master.

139
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,990
Please don't.

140
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,790
I know

141
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,230
you're worried about my health.

142
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,730
If I can only stay in the sect and wait,

143
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,540
what right do I have

144
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,790
to be his grandpa?

145
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,860
Actually,

146
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,790
I've long wanted to

147
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,460
seek the herbs with you.

148
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,230
It’s just that I've been

149
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,370
busy with matters in the sect.

150
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,850
No matter what,

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,740
as long as I'm here,

152
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,750
I won't let you

153
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,750
take the risk.

154
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,130
Everyone has to go through life and death.

155
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,380
I'm over 60 years old.

156
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,070
I have one foot

157
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,310
in the grave.

158
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,750
What does it matter

159
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,720
if I give it a go?

160
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,270
Besides,

161
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,950
I

162
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,600
want to retire.

163
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,950
Master, you want to retire from the martial world?

164
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,830
Yes.

165
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,030
The Dragon's Tongue is found in the wild

166
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,050
and does not involve the interests of the sects.

167
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,770
But in the future, our search

168
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,250
will inevitably conflict with other sects.

169
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,179
If I continue to take action

170
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,380
as the head of Celestial Alp Sect,

171
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,950
I'm afraid

172
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,919
I would one day

173
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,150
ruin Celestial Alp Sect's reputation.

174
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,429
I can’t

175
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,950
let all my efforts

176
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,470
be in vain.

177
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,430
But...

178
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,550
Zhanbai.

179
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,670
You don't have to persuade me.

180
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,550
I've made up my mind.

181
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,180
After I retire,

182
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,630
I will go with you to look for the herbs

183
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,360
and cure Mo as soon as possible.

184
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,870
Now the martial world

185
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,030
is not peaceful.

186
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,440
During Yuan Yi Palace's ambush this time,

187
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,350
If you hadn't traveled with me,

188
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,590
I'm afraid I wouldn't have

189
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,110
gotten away so easily.

190
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,180
Yuan Yi Palace has been quiet for many years.

191
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,030
Why is it suddenly

192
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,230
taking action?

193
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,950
Previously, when White Cloud Palace's

194
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,150
Mr. Qin was murdered,

195
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,470
I already suspected

196
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,840
it was done by Yuan Yi Palace.

197
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,210
Now that Yuan Yi Palace has sent assassins

198
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,740
to try and assassinate you,

199
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,830
I think

200
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,020
they are trying to weaken

201
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,590
the martial world in the Central Plains

202
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,430
to seize the chance for their return.

203
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,910
It seems that Chang Wujue

204
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,350
hasn't given up on his evil intentions.

205
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,860
I'll write to Chief Nangong immediately

206
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,790
and report this.

207
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,390
He will surely

208
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,070
inform all sects in the Central Plains

209
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,270
to take precautions.

210
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,350
Okay.

211
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,140
[To Xue Ziye]

212
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,450
I found the guard on duty on the night

213
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,710
the poison was stolen.

214
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,490
The thief struck her once.

215
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,170
Fortunately, she received timely treatment

216
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,970
and survived.

217
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,910
But she remains wounded.

218
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,870
I think

219
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,270
if you read her pulse,

220
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,790
you can probably determine

221
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,980
what her internal injury

222
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,980
was caused by.

223
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
Lots of things happened

224
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,890
to the sect while I was gone.

225
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,500
Therefore, I cannot leave for the time being.

226
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,690
I've sent my trusted subordinates

227
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,130
to follow the official path

228
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,260
and send her to the Apothecary Valley.

229
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,700
If you're worried,

230
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,740
you can send someone to fetch them.

231
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,820
Regards, Jing.

232
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,790
The witness is on the way.

233
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,280
Shuang Hong.

234
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,910
Take Xiao Cheng

235
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,380
to the official path and fetch them.

236
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,150
Make sure to

237
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,310
bring them back here safely.

238
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,670
Yes.

239
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,710
That person was seriously injured

240
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,550
and is weak.

241
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,810
Take good care of her on the way.

242
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,530
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

243
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,860
I won’t let you down.

244
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,230
Thank you.

245
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,650
Anything else?

246
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,510
Mr. Huo.

247
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,710
Did you make an appointment

248
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,150
to come back?

249
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,480
That's strange.

250
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,500
On the day you came back,

251
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,170
Chief stayed at the valley's opening for a while,

252
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,100
as if she knew you were coming back.

253
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,310
Really?

254
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,430
Yes.

255
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:26,220
♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

256
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,910
♫Plum blossoms are about to fall; I'll see you here♫

257
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,760
♫Why are you late and why is it about to snow again?♫

258
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,980
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

259
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,090
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

260
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:00,300
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

261
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,630
Sorry

262
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,590
for waking you up.

263
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,150
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

264
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,080
What’s on your mind?

265
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,510
Why do you ask?

266
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,590
You have always been calm.

267
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,550
But you were sleeping with

268
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,860
your brows furrowed just now.

269
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:21,950
Something must

270
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,840
have happened.

271
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,430
Do you remember

272
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,470
what I said to you

273
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,320
when we first met?

274
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,170
Humans have their own destinies,

275
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,930
but human will still matters.

276
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,350
Back then, I broke the Snow Hail Formation

277
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,750
and made you take Mo in.

278
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,300
Every time I came back,

279
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,490
I was at the brink of death.

280
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,350
You saved me

281
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,480
over and over again.

282
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,150
I don't know

283
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,370
what happened to you,

284
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,680
but I believe in you.

285
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,240
Chief Xue,

286
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,280
as long as you want it,

287
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,270
you can do it.

288
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,150
You're right.

289
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,360
I was blinded by worries

290
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,270
and became afraid.

291
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,550
My mood became a mess.

292
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,880
Calm and collected,

293
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,630
logical and analytical.

294
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,680
That's the Chief Xue I know.

295
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,430
You sound like your master

296
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,940
when you lecture others.

297
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,350
I think

298
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,350
you're starting to act like a chief.

299
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,830
You were so down just now.

300
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,880
But your words are still so witty.

301
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,770
Naturally.

302
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,030
Xu Mo.

303
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,510
Today, I'll

304
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,970
teach you swordsmanship.

305
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,830
You must focus.

306
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,240
Look carefully.

307
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,600
Learn properly.

308
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,510
Okay.

309
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,000
Come on.

310
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,680
Start.

311
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,700
Left.

312
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,670
Right.

313
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,250
Stab it out.

314
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,590
Now sweep.

315
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,150
Okay.

316
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,670
Again.

317
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,870
Mo.

318
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,120
Here.

319
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,750
This move...

320
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,750
Good.

321
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,550
Lower your shoulders.

322
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,180
Keep your elbow flat.

323
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,730
Don't move.

324
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,190
Yes.

325
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,150
Hold it.

326
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,660
That's right.

327
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,030
Master.

328
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,480
When a disciple

329
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,270
is lacking,

330
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,230
it's due to the teacher's

331
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,320
poor teaching.

332
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,710
I'll remember that, Master.

333
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,790
I still remember when I was young,

334
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,550
you were more stern than you are now

335
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,310
when you taught me back then.

336
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,320
What?

337
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,330
You've grown up

338
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,910
and dare to blame me now?

339
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,190
I dare not.

340
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,950
Zhanbai,

341
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,910
your achievements today

342
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,390
are due to

343
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,710
your great talent.

344
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,870
I was just

345
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,590
guiding you from the side.

346
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,670
But

347
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,550
you have to remember

348
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,070
what I said to you.

349
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,600
Whatever you do and become,

350
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,830
do not disappoint

351
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,440
the sword in your hand.

352
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,130
I will always remember it.

353
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,590
Xu Mo.

354
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,230
Let's do it again.

355
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,150
Mr. Huo and Chief Qiushui

356
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,020
are like father and son.

357
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,630
Previously, he risked his life to find the herbs

358
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,710
and almost died.

359
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,600
Now they can finally

360
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,030
reunite with each other.

361
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,360
You're so considerate of them.

362
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,310
Chief.

363
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,070
What is it?

364
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,990
Shuang Hong and Xiao Cheng

365
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,210
came back with the guard.

366
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,470
She's at the pharmacy.

367
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,310
Let's take a look.

368
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,680
Let's go.

369
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,670
Remember,

370
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,670
don't let other guests

371
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,670
know her identity,

372
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,069
especially Huo Zhanbai.

373
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,990
Xiao Cheng, Lan Lan.

374
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,310
You two stay at the door.

375
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,480
Don't let anyone near.

376
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,030
Yes.

377
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,590
I heard from Chief Jing that

378
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,520
she was treated by a doctor before.

379
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,810
But somehow,

380
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,030
not only did she not get better,

381
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,440
but her condition even worsened.

382
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Three years ago, she entered a coma.

383
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,680
On our way here,

384
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,430
Xiao Cheng and I

385
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,090
have observed her condition.

386
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,150
Although her body is burning, her expression is calm.

387
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,950
Although her speech is delirious, her voice is faint.

388
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,240
The wrinkles are falsely mottled and shallow.

389
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,670
The tongue coating is red,

390
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,990
but the clothes are not restrained.

391
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,030
Her urination is not abundant,

392
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,560
and she is not constipated.

393
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,840
Her pulse is faint and weak,

394
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,880
floating and rootless.

395
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,060
It's a condition of false heat and true cold.

396
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,670
False heat and true cold?

397
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,670
The Yin symptoms appear like the Yang symptoms.

398
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,990
Extreme water appears like fire.

399
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,070
Yin cold flourishes internally,

400
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,670
while false Yang symptoms appear externally.

401
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,790
The doctor who once treated her

402
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,320
must have been fooled by

403
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,000
the false heat symptoms

404
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,690
and used the wrong treatment.

405
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,710
Not only did it fail to treat the symptoms,

406
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,880
but it also caused the internal coldness to worsen.

407
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,950
No wonder her condition

408
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,990
is getting worse.

409
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,810
Now,

410
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,440
the coldness remains deep in her

411
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,950
while the weak heat is on the surface.

412
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,350
It's a true Yin cold condition.

413
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,810
That's why she's in a coma.

414
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,300
Make the Yang Restoration Soup.

415
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,950
Feed her every six hours.

416
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,630
Take good care of her.

417
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,710
Adjust the medication as you see fit.

418
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,190
Yes.

419
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,310
I wonder if she

420
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,030
can wake up.

421
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,590
If something goes wrong

422
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,850
and the lead ends here,

423
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,050
where should I start again?

424
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,430
Chief.

425
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,670
Is the person playing the flute

426
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,730
your chess friend?

427
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,620
Why don't you let him show up?

428
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,560
When will you

429
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,120
go to the Apothecary Valley again for chess again?

430
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,250
If you don't like it,

431
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,890
I won't go there again.

432
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,230
Silly child.

433
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,520
It's not that I don't want you to go.

434
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,630
I just don't want you

435
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,890
to hide things from me.

436
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,480
I understand.

437
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,040
I heard there is a white plum in the Apothecary Valley.

438
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,950
It's cold and aloof.

439
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,880
A fine specimen.

440
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,600
Unfortunately,

441
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,030
it's not in my palace.

442
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,970
Fortunately, I love and treasure flowers.

443
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,770
Otherwise, if I wanted to destroy it,

444
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,480
I would need just a moment

445
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
to turn it into

446
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,600
withered leaves

447
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,320
and never bloom again.

448
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,400
She's awake.

449
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,980
Chief.

450
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,950
She's awake.

451
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,880
How do you feel?

452
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,880
Do you hurt anywhere?

453
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,830
Can you see, hear, and speak?

454
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,670
Where am I?

455
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,230
This is the Apothecary Valley.

456
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,230
Chief Jing is my sister.

457
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,600
Don't worry.

458
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,730
Be careful.

459
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,630
This is a letter Chief Jing

460
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,110
delivered along with you.

461
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,140
She told you to read it

462
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,070
when you wake up.

463
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,710
Since the Chief has given the order,

464
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,190
I’ll tell you everything

465
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,620
I know.

466
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,790
Do you remember

467
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,350
the appearance of the person

468
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,480
who stole the arsenopyrite that year?

469
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:51,920
Chief Xue.

470
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,670
You must be used to drinking Laughing at the World.

471
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,400
Why don't you try mine tonight?

472
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
What wine is this?

473
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,630
Try it first.

474
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,630
How is it?

475
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,850
Where did you get this?

476
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,430
While traveling the past few years,

477
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,230
I often passed by

478
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,030
the Ping'an Inn at Chi Mountain.

479
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,630
I used the antiseptic you prepared for me

480
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,350
to treat an

481
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,920
inn member's wound.

482
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,580
Later, the shopkeeper

483
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
kept it in mind.

484
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,160
So she gave her daughter's wedding wine

485
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,960
to you and me

486
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,010
to express her gratitude.

487
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,610
You gave them the medicine,

488
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,560
not me.

489
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,890
I won't accept any reward without contributions.

490
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,290
What else do they need?

491
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,550
The owner's daughter

492
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,150
seems to be pregnant.

493
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,610
Maybe we can prepare some supplements.

494
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,590
Bring it with you when you leave the valley.

495
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,470
It's just a little boring

496
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,390
to drink.

497
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,750
How about

498
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,680
a drinking game?

499
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,830
You know drinking games?

500
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,860
If you win,

501
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,750
I'll answer a question

502
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,030
each time.

503
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,550
If you lose,

504
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,950
you have to answer my question instead.

505
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,950
What do you think?

506
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,110
What?

507
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,830
Are you afraid you can't defeat me?

508
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,830
Me? Afraid of you?

509
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,590
Here.

510
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,710
Pour the wine.

511
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,390
Come on.

512
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,650
-Good brothers.
-Good brothers.

513
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,800
-Three stars.
-Four fortune.

514
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,200
-Top five.
-Six passage.

515
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,320
Go ahead.

516
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,170
The day my master sent me back,

517
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,190
I heard you were at the valley entrance in the afternoon

518
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,470
for a good while.

519
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,870
What were you

520
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,750
waiting for?

521
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,300
Feng Lyu talked too much again.

522
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,790
Chief Xue,

523
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,110
I’m asking you a question.

524
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,090
What is your question?

525
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,230
So, were you

526
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,200
waiting for something?

527
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,480
What does that mean?

528
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,230
So what were you waiting for?

529
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,830
This is the second question.

530
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,270
You...

531
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,230
Again.

532
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,230
-Good brothers.
-Good brothers.

533
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,830
-Top five.
-Six, six, six...

534
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,950
So, Chief Xue,

535
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,770
what were you waiting for?

536
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,430
I...

537
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,350
Was waiting for a dumb deer.

538
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,790
A dumb deer?

539
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,670
There's a dumb deer in the forest,

540
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,440
running around every year.

541
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,050
Every time he got hurt,

542
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,350
he would lie in front of the Apothecary Valley.

543
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,550
I was waiting for him.

544
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,500
That dumb deer

545
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,290
must have know that

546
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,620
someone would save him,

547
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,930
so he lay there.

548
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,110
That's not that dumb.

549
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,870
In that case,

550
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,460
he's quite smart.

551
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,510
Exactly.

552
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,910
Again.

553
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,750
-Good brothers.
-Good brothers.

554
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,280
-Eight horses.
-Full hall.

555
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,820
You lost.

556
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,150
Hurry, drink.

557
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,310
You're quite enthusiastic after winning.

558
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:11,830
Go ahead.

559
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,660
Tell me the truth.

560
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,550
Do you really have no money to pay your debt?

561
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,950
That's all you wanted to ask?

562
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,670
Of course.

563
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,380
You're drinking and playing games with me

564
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,840
in the middle of the night.

565
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,310
I thought

566
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,990
you had something important

567
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,670
to tell me.

568
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,370
Isn't this important?

569
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,070
It's not only hard to cure you,

570
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,030
but it also takes a lot of materials.

571
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,360
Now you're even in debt.

572
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,830
Money is the most important to me.

573
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,470
If you have money,

574
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,530
hurry up and pay me.

575
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,810
I have no money.

576
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,350
Really?

577
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,630
Really.

578
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,870
You really don't have money?

579
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,070
I really don't.

580
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,870
Your jade pendant is nice.

581
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,600
Use it to pay your debt instead.

582
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,150
Didn't I tell you?

583
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,830
No.

584
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,520
Why not?

585
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,810
My master gave it to me.

586
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,330
Chief Qiushui?

587
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,230
When I was young,

588
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,230
I lost a spar

589
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,970
and was laughed at.

590
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,710
I was very upset.

591
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,710
So I sneaked up on them

592
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,440
and attacked them from behind.

593
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,590
After Master found out,

594
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,590
he was very angry.

595
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,310
So...

596
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,580
To martial arts practitioners,

597
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,470
winning or losing doesn't matter.

598
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,310
[Young Huo Zhanbai]

599
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,780
The most important thing

600
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,540
is virtue.

601
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,230
[Chief of Celestial Alp Sect Qiushui He]

602
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,140
Rather than win with dirty tricks,

603
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,830
it's better to lose fair and square.

604
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,210
Sneak attacks are dirty tricks.

605
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,470
Understood?

606
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,740
Yes.

607
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,990
I will be punished

608
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,140
with you.

609
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,950
Master.

610
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,630
You are my master

611
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,220
and my father figure.

612
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,390
Master,

613
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,100
please accept my respect.

614
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,160
Correcting one's mistake

615
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,370
is a great virtue.

616
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,480
You're a good child.

617
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,500
These are two jade pendants

618
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,200
made from the same piece of jade.

619
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,550
You and I

620
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,690
will each have one.

621
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,000
How can I be sure that

622
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,500
you didn't make that up because

623
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,190
you didn't want to give it to me?

624
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,190
If Chief Qiushui had one,

625
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,040
why didn't I see him wear it?

626
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,760
My master lost his long ago.

627
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,190
When was that?

628
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,830
Why do you

629
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,360
care about my jade pendant?

630
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,090
I'm afraid he might have lost it in the valley.

631
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,290
What if he blames me for it in the future?

632
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,830
It was lost several years ago.

633
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,890
He can't blame you.

634
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,350
Wait a minute.

635
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,390
I only lost to you once

636
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,920
and answered so many questions.

637
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Are you cheating?

638
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,180
I can beat you a few more times.

639
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,870
Wait.

640
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,230
We've played a few rounds

641
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,290
and drank the wine.

642
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,280
We should at least have a toast.

643
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,270
Here.

644
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,080
Chief, how did it go?

645
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,520
Did you get any answer?

646
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
That jade pendant

647
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,290
was given to him by Chief Qiushui.

648
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,590
Chief Qiushui

649
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,690
has an identical pendant.

650
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,750
The person who stole the arsenopyrite

651
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,390
was Mr. Seven's master?

652
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,870
Chief Qiushui's jade pendant

653
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,760
was lost years ago.

654
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,120
Did he really lose it

655
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,720
or was he hiding something?

656
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,540
That jade pendant

657
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,340
might have really been lost

658
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,830
and picked up by the murderer.

659
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,760
It's hard to say.

660
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,340
But if Qiushui He was really the one

661
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,260
who stole the arsenopyrite...

662
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,650
There's still something fishy about this.

663
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,310
We can't make any conclusion.

664
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,720
I need to find another way

665
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,430
to get some answers from Chief Qiushui.

666
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,190
But Mr. Seven is also in the valley.

667
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,360
I'm afraid this won't end well.

668
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,990
Mr. Seven

669
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,550
is a man of great righteousness.

670
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,610
Of course, he will prioritize

671
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,870
justice and the truth.

672
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,990
He treats Qiushui He as his father.

673
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,500
The strength and weight

674
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,340
of their bond

675
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,110
is just like the bond

676
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,310
between me and the Mo Family Villagers.

677
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,280
It's stronger than blood ties.

678
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,380
I can't let go of my bond,

679
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,740
neither can I force him

680
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,410
to let go of his bond.

681
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,510
Seventh Brother.

682
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,350
I saw the Apothecary Valley's

683
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,980
Back Mountain Cenotaph that day.

684
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,900
I know you advised me

685
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,830
not to pry into Chief Xue’s secret.

686
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,730
But I thought about it.

687
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,760
The whole village died on the same day.

688
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,090
It must have been a heinous crime.

689
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,590
The Sword Sect

690
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,870
has always been responsible for eliminating evildoers.

691
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,440
I can't sit by and do nothing.

692
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,110
After that,

693
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,710
I started investigating

694
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,860
into Chief Xue’s background.

695
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,700
I found that Chief Xue

696
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,720
was the daughter of the Xue family National Master.

697
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,470
Later, the Xue family committed a serious crime.

698
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,870
All men of the family were executed,

699
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,330
and the women were exiled.

700
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,520
During exile, Chief Xue somehow

701
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,380
ended up staying in Mo Family Village.

702
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,030
That village

703
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,550
was indeed massacred on New Year's Eve

704
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,340
in the fourth year of the Huijia era.

705
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,340
The real murderer is still unknown.

706
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,330
Thinking back on the Back Mountain Cenotaph,

707
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,090
I guess

708
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
this must be Chief Xue's

709
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,070
long-standing trouble.

710
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,240
You came at the right time.

711
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,500
I was about to find you.

712
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,910
Your wound

713
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,270
has almost recovered.

714
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,350
You can leave the valley now.

715
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,030
Also.

716
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,270
You left this bottle

717
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,920
at the valley last time.

718
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,300
Don't forget it again.

719
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,929
You're sending me off just like that?

720
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,010
You've recovered.

721
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,560
Shouldn't you be going?

722
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,600
Are you

723
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,570
really planning to

724
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,570
stay in my valley?

725
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,909
You're right.

726
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,469
It's time to go.

727
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:31,350
It's just that normally,

728
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,159
you would check my pulse again.

729
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,239
It's a bit sudden this time.

730
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,719
I don't need to check your pulse this time.

731
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:39,530
By the way,

732
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,460
why did you

733
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,830
come to see me?

734
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,590
I wanted to ask you...

735
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:44,679
What?

736
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,230
Nothing.

737
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,040
Thank you

738
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,989
for your care these days.

739
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,400
After I leave,

740
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,980
please take good care of

741
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,350
my master and junior.

742
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,990
Of course.

743
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,400
Rest early.

744
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,070
Zhanbai,

745
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,150
you must prioritize your personal safety.

746
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,950
After I settle the sect's affairs,

747
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,390
I'll meet up with you

748
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,540
as discussed

749
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,210
and look for the herbs together.

750
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,410
Master, don't worry.

751
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,830
I will find the herbs

752
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,910
before you join me.

753
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,730
Oh, you.

754
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,570
Senior.

755
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,710
You must take good care of yourself.

756
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,500
Got it.

757
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,190
By the way,

758
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,610
where’s Mo?

759
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,070
I asked Xiao Huan to play with him elsewhere.

760
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,600
Otherwise, if he were here,

761
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,140
he would surely cry and stop you from leaving.

762
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,520
I wanted to tell him that

763
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,230
I'd go to Guazhou as soon as possible

764
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,890
and teach him swordsmanship.

765
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,750
Mr. Seven.

766
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,450
This is your box of medicine this time.

767
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,780
Feng Lyu, you're quick.

768
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,720
Of course.

769
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,080
It’s the Chief's order.

770
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,680
Master, Junior.

771
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,220
I'll leave now.

772
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,110
Okay.

773
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,580
Take care, Senior.

774
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,810
So much medicine.

775
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,670
You woman.

776
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,950
You're trying to kick me out,

777
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,830
but you're actually more worried about me than anyone else.

778
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,230
You prepared more medicine than last time.

779
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,840
Are you afraid that I'll die out there?

780
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,820
Speaking of which,

781
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,950
this was the first time

782
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,350
she actively asked me to look for the herbs.

783
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,030
Are you here

784
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,630
to ask Sister Ye to treat you?

785
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,530
You’re the boy from Longmen Village?

786
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,510
Yes.

787
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,220
How did you know me?

788
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,060
Did Sister Ye tell you about me?

789
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,190
Someone told me

790
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,530
you're afraid of needles,

791
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,470
right?

792
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,360
It's cold today.

793
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,310
Why are you entering the valley alone?

794
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,450
Today is the first day of the month.

795
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,770
Sister Ye usually visits

796
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,960
Longmen Village to offer free treatment.

797
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,490
But Sister Shuang Hong said

798
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,670
there was something important in the valley today

799
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,130
and she won't be visiting.

800
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,110
Grandpa Li wants me

801
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,320
to exercise a little.

802
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,240
So he sent me to deliver things.

803
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,730
Something important?

804
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,960
Something is fishy.

805
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,350
Chief Qiushui.

806
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,640
Recently, while reviewing medical texts,

807
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
I read in an ancient prescription that

808
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,180
liver stagnation and melancholy

809
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,040
can be treated with moxibustion.

810
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,450
So I came to check on you.

811
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,270
Thank you.

812
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,070
I happen not to feel well these days.

813
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,290
Maybe my old illness is acting up.

814
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,700
This is...

815
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,640
This is soothing incense.

816
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,390
It can calm your nerves

817
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,660
and cure your discomfort.

818
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,540
Feng Lyu, how is it going over there?

819
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,390
Xiao Cheng has brought

820
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,190
Mrs. Qiushui and Mo

821
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,460
to the Summer Garden for the hot spring.

822
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,670
We will try our best to stall them

823
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,150
to buy some time for the Chief.

824
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,300
What about things on your end?

825
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
She is already in the Autumn Garden.

826
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,710
Although Mr. Seven has left,

827
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,950
Mrs. Qiushui is still here.

828
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,740
We must be careful.

829
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,710
Don't let her find out.

830
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,440
Don't worry.

831
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,460
If anything happens,

832
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,130
remember to remind the Chief.

833
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,060
Okay, let's go.

834
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Who are you?

835
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,670
Qiushui He

836
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,230
of Celestial Alp Sect.

837
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,090
Do you know about the Mo Family Village?

838
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,070
Master.

839
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,630
Master.

840
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,030
Is this why you rushed me out

841
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,760
of the valley to find the herbs?

842
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,390
So what if it is?

843
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,270
Is it because of

844
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,400
the massacre at the Mo Family Village?

845
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,270
I just asked him

846
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,240
if he knew about the Mo Family Village.

847
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,300
I didn't mention about the massacre.

848
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,470
When Fourth Brother was in the valley,

849
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,150
he accidentally entered the back mountain.

850
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,950
He thought there must be more to it,

851
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,950
so he investigated your background

852
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,560
and told me about it.

853
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,630
I saw that monument too.

854
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,420
I'm sorry.

855
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,310
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

856
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,470
Since you know the truth,

857
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,380
I'll be honest with you.

858
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,450
I saw a jade pendant

859
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,760
on that man.

860
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,200
It's a rare jade pendant.

861
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,820
If we can find it,

862
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,700
we might be able to find some clues.

863
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:01,870
Please draw it

864
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,870
out for me.

865
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,670
This jade pendant

866
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,110
looks familiar.

867
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,350
It looks exactly the same as

868
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,550
the one on Huo Zhanbai.

869
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,790
I've been investigating the Mo Family Village massacre

870
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,830
for many years.

871
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,670
It's closely related to the jade pendant

872
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,470
on your waist.

873
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,370
And the one with the same jade pendant

874
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,630
is your master.

875
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,790
So you drank and played games with me that night

876
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,150
to get answers out of me

877
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,280
regarding the jade pendant's origin.

878
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,990
To find out the truth,

879
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,960
I can only do this.

880
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:47,970
In your position,

881
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,770
it's not wrong for you to do this.

882
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,870
But I believe in my master.

883
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,740
He would never kill innocent people

884
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,510
or do something as vile

885
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,170
as killing an entire village.

886
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,690
His jade pendant has long been lost.

887
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,240
Maybe someone picked it up

888
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,790
and framed him on purpose.

889
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:06,890
There's no evidence

890
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,150
that he really lost it.

891
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,510
What if he lied

892
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,470
to you about it?

893
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,240
Impossible.

894
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,440
There must be some misunderstanding.

895
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,200
That's why I must use the mind-reading technique

896
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
to find out the truth.

897
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,230
Chief Xue.

898
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,840
How dare you stop me?

899
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,150
If you dare to interfere,

900
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,230
don’t blame me for turning hostile.

901
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,490
Even if you want to ask,

902
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,800
you should ask him face to face.

903
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,010
Can you give me one day?

904
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,310
The Mo Family Village to you

905
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,750
is like the Celestial Alp Sect to me.

906
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,790
If I were you,

907
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,070
I would have sought the truth too.

908
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,440
Why would I stop you?

909
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,940
But he is my master after all.

910
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,230
How can I watch you

911
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,430
use the mind-reading technique on him?

912
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,710
Besides,

913
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,070
if he's not the murderer,

914
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,910
when he wakes up,

915
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,390
there will only be conflicts.

916
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,320
The situation will only get worse.

917
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,310
Give me one day.

918
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,190
I will give you an explanation.

919
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,340
You and him are master and disciple.

920
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,580
You shouldn't interfere in this.

921
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,030
It's exactly because we're master and disciple that

922
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,430
I should be the one to ask.

923
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,830
Let me prove Master's innocence.

924
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,350
Okay?

925
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:28,630
Okay.

926
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,710
I'll give you one day.

927
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,110
But before we find out the truth,

928
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,830
I will order someone

929
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,170
to keep an eye on Qiushui He.

930
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,480
I won't let him leave the valley.
