00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,490
Be careful!

5
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,240
You're injured?

6
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,710
I don't want to kill anyone today.

7
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,640
Get out of my way!

8
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,360
Seven.

9
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,150
Are you okay?

10
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,830
He's injured.

11
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,010
Envoy Miao Feng, you're so arrogant.

12
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,190
Do you think

13
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,630
you can get through us?

14
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,390
Don't push me.

15
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,590
If the seven of you fight against me together,

16
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,070
indeed, you can stop me.

17
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,430
But at least

18
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,829
half of you will die here.

19
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,230
I'm in a hurry to save someone's life.

20
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,360
Please don't make it difficult for me.

21
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,750
Let's just go our separate ways!

22
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,350
Save someone's life?

23
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,760
That person is so important to you?

24
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,520
Is that person Chang Wujue?

25
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,950
It's a woman.

26
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,550
She has been poisoned.

27
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,130
Will you get out of my way or not?

28
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,800
We are in a hurry to go somewhere today.

29

he's from the Yuan Yi Palace.

The entrance to the Yuan Yi Palace marked on the map

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,270
is right here.

72
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,490
But there's no road ahead.

73
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,570
Yeah.

74
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,280
Don't tell me

75
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
we need to jump.

76
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,390
The Yuan Yi Palace is in chaos.

77
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,850
We can't delay any longer.

78
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,110
I'll go down to take a look first.

79
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,440
Seven!

80
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,030
Come down!

81
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,630
Indeed,

82
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,230
this is the entrance to the Yuan Yi Palace.

83
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,160
The terrain here is really unique.

84
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,110
One side of the mountain appears towering,

85
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,110
while the other side

86
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,950
slopes gently into a valley

87
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,210
with a modest descent.

88
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,990
Let's move forward then.

89
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,960
It has been such a smooth journey.

90
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,170
No one has showed up to stop us.

91
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,470
It's so quiet.

92
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,030
I'm afraid something is wrong.

93
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,470
Yeah.

94
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,530
There's not even a guard.

95
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,750
I wonder where their leaders

96
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,590
are.

97
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,150
It's so quiet.

98
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,350
It's so quiet that it's a bit scary.

99
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,310
The palace just experienced internal strife.

100
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,240
Maybe they made some adjustments.

101
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,160
We'd better be careful.

102
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,450
It's Miao Kong, one of the Five Sages.

103
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,030
You'll know when you arrive

104
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,510
at the Yuan Yi Palace.

105
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,440
-Seventh Brother!
-Seven!

106
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,490

is it you?

108
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,390
-Six?
-Sixth Brother?

109
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:53,990
Six?

110
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,140
You're finally here.

111
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
I've been waiting

112
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,430
for you.

113
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,730
Sixth Brother.

114
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,960
Six,

115
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,170
it's really you.

116
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,310
Seven.

117
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,410
Sixth Brother.

118
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,930
Sixth Brother, it's really you.

119
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,690
You are still alive.

120
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,730
Sixth Brother,

121
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,380
why have you become like this?

122
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,640
What on earth happened?

123
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,750
Back then,

124
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,750
I was ordered by Chief

125
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,970
to fake my death and work undercover.

126
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
I've worked undercover for eight years

127
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,250
just for this moment:

128
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,200
to collaborate with you

129
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,630
to eliminate the Yuan Yi Palace.

130
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,430
Back then,

131
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,030
Seven wanted to take you back to Sword Sect.

132
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,670
Yes.

133
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,910
Seven wanted me

134
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,970
to go back with him.

135
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,410
I deliberately faked my death

136
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,950
by falling off the cliff.

137
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,310
I lied to you.

138
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,390
Everyone thought

139
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,390
Seven killed you.

140
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,690
He faced much criticism for that.

141
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,200
But he never explained.

142
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,530
Sixth Brother.

143
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,520
It's good that you're still alive.

144
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,560
It's good that you're still alive.

145
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,630
If Junior knows you're still alive,

146
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,760
she would be very happy.

147
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,090
She would be very happy.

148
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,310
After so many years,

149
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,030
the Eight Swords of Sword Sect

150
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,290
are finally together.

151
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,530
Sixth Brother,

152
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,030
thank you for your hard work over the years.

153
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,710
Seven,

154
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,160
thank you for your hard work

155
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,810
over the past eight years.

156
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,870
I instigated internal strife in the Yuan Yi Palace.

157
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,510
Chang Wujue is dead.

158
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,830
The Yuan Yi Palace doesn't have a leader now.

159
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,090
It's chaotic and weak.

160
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,750
Now is the best time

161
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,150
to destroy them in one go.

162
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,320
Chang Wujue is dead?

163
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:25,990
Yes.

164
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,590
Miao Shui betrayed him.

165
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,310
She died with Chang Wujue.

166
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,390
Miao Feng has left.

167
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,650
What about Eye?

168
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,910
Eye was severely injured by Chang Wujue.

169
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,270
He is being imprisoned in the Snow Prison.

170
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,470
He's in a living hell.

171
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,000
The Five Sages are all gone.

172
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,550
I cleared the obstacles

173
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,430
on your way here in advance.

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,830
No wonder it was so quiet

175
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,630
along the way.

176
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,700
It turns out Sixth Brother

177
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,230
cleared the obstacles in advance.

178
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,760
Let's go.

179
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,710
Let me take you

180
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,970
to Chang Wujue's body.

181
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,360
Okay.

182
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,250
Sixth Brother.

183
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,510
Mo...

184
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,480
I know.

185
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,910
He is Chang Wujue?

186
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,900
I heard from Chief

187
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,110
Chang Wujue practiced the Iron Horse Glacier

188
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,590
to make himself immortal.

189
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,590
I didn't expect him

190
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,120
to be like this when he died.

191
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,330
The golden needles...

192
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,000
Seven,

193
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,830
Chang Wujue is dead,

194
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,980
but we still have

195
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,780
something more important to do.

196
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,670
Many people who were taken here

197
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,960
are still being imprisoned.

198
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,790
We need to find a way

199
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,750
to save them.

200
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,580
They are imprisoned

201
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,890
in the Snow Prison,

202
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,910
the Asura Field,

203
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,840
and the dungeon.

204
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:17,790
Two,

205
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,160
let's go to the Snow Prison.

206
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,600
Okay.

207
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,310
Third Brother, Eighth Brother,

208
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,110
let's go to the dungeon.

209
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,550
Okay.

210
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,420
Then let's go to the Asura Field.

211
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,080
Eye is in charge of that place.

212
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,630
Perhaps there are still remnants.

213
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,030
Okay.

214
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,630
We'll go to the Asura Field.

215
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,950
Everyone, be careful.

216
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,910
Let's split up.

217
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:32,790
Okay.

218
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,270
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

219
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,440
Let's go.

220
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,440
Here.

221
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,650
Third Brother.

222
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,600
Let's go!

223
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:31,990
Go!

224
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,200
Go!

225
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,230
Eight,

226
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,850
protect the children!

227
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,710
How have you been?

228
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,740
Seven.

229
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,110
Eye?

230
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,250
Sixth Brother,

231
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,870
isn't he injured?

232
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,290
Don't look into his eyes.

233
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,730
Assess his positions

234
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,870
according to his movements.

235
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,410
-Okay.
-Okay.

236
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,080
Long time no see.

237
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,290
I don't want to see her distressed or heartbroken.

238
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,150
I don't want to fight against you.

239
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,560
But it seems unavoidable today.

240
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,370
I don't plan to fight against you.

241
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
With me here,

242
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,100
of course you don't need to fight.

243
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,210
Sixth Brother.

244
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,390
You...

245
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,000
Sixth Brother?

246
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,550
Who is your Sixth Brother?

247
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,000
This is Sword Sect's

248
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,910
business.

249
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,450
Handle it yourselves.

250
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,069
Sixth Brother, what are you doing?

251
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,270
Let Fifth Brother go!

252
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,859
Let him go?

253
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,069
So this is your trap.

254
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,589
That's right.

255
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,310
You betrayed Sword Sect?

256
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,590
Which side are you on?

257
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,480
I figured it out long ago.

258
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,990
The good and the evil are irreconcilable?

259
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,120
Eliminate the evil to uphold justice?

260
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,470
That is just a lie.

261
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,990
I want to dominate the martial world in the Central Plains.

262
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,270
I want to become Sword Sect's chief.

263
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,090
You spent eight years with the devil,

264
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,400
and your temperament has changed.

265
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,570
It's been eight years.

266
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,470
Eight years ago,

267
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,150
I volunteered

268
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,110
to work undercover in the Yuan Yi Palace

269
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,400
just to make contributions

270
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,870
to become the chief

271
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,710
of Sword Sect.

272
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,790
For that, I abandoned my wife and son

273
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,330
and endured humiliation.

274
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,030
My life was a living hell.

275
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,040
All these years,

276
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,370
I've suffered so much torment.

277
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,210
But what have I gained from it?

278
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,150
My family has been ruined.

279
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,950
My reputation has been damaged.

280
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,910
In the end,

281
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,730
you're the best candidate for the chief.

282
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,350
But what about me?

283
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,210
I can only hide in darkness.

284
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,350
I can't reunite with my wife.

285
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,450
I hate it.

286
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
I hate there is

287
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,390
a deep bond between us.

288
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,000
I hate Chief

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,060
always favors you.

290
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,710
What I hate more is

291
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,110
I've gone through countless hardships,

292
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,370
but you want to take the credit in the end.

293
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,270
I've endured all those for so many years

294
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,870
and waited for so many years,

295
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,530
only to receive the news of Mo's death.

296
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,870
And what I have to bear

297
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,790
is that Qiushui still likes you.

298
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,550
I've had enough!

299
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,150
Chonghua,

300
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,350
you are so ungrateful!

301
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,220
Over the past eight years,

302
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,470
Seven risked his life

303
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,920
to look for medicine for Mo.

304
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,390
To keep his promise,

305
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,310
-he's been taking care of your wife and children.
-Yes!

306
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,700
I should thank Seven!

307
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,910
He is

308
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,240
a chivalrous hero.

309
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
But what about me?

310
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,320
I'm just someone

311
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,630
living in disgrace,

312
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,310
burdened with the label of a traitor!

313
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,110
I've never wanted to compete with you

314
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,640
for the chief of Sword Sect.

315
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,160
Senior, it's not too late to turn back now.

316
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
But there is no turning back!

317
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,710
Things have come this far.

318
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,210
There is no turning back.

319
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,030
I...

320
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,950
can't go back either.

321
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,100
What about Junior?

322
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,550
She's waiting for you to go back.

323
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,020
Don't you care about her?

324
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,070
After I become

325
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,470
the chief of Sword Sect,

326
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,630
I'll visit her.

327
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,930
Sixth Brother.

328
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,430
Now,

329
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,210
drop the Dark Soul Sword in your hand.

330
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,030
Seven,

331
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,750
you can't drop the sword!

332
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,770
Fifth Brother.

333
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,290
Drop your sword immediately.

334
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,110
Or

335
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,550
I'll kill him now.

336
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,470
Seven,

337
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,230
don't worry about me.

338
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,830
Kill this

339
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,690
heartless and disloyal traitor!

340
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,120
Drop your sword.

341
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,290
Since I'm the one you hate,

342
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,370
do whatever you want to me.

343
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,360
Please let Fifth Brother go.

344
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,710
What I hate the most

345
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,640
is your self-righteous demeanor.

346
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,880
Don't worry.

347
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,520
I won't let you

348
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,030
die easily.

349
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,240
Eye,

350
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,450
cooperate with me.

351
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,230
Just do it.

352
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,870
Huo Zhanbai,

353
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,890
you didn't expect this, did you?

354
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,380
I'll make you taste

355
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,330
the pain of losing your loved ones.

356
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,550
I'll make sure

357
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,480
all the brothers of Sword Sect

358
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,940
die because of you.

359
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,950
Wei Fengxing

360
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,070
will be the first one.

361
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,190
Eye,

362
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,080
you lied to me.

363
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,330
Why didn't you help me?

364
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,790
We had a deal.

365
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,000
I only told you to do it.

366
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,160
I never said

367
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,650
I would help you kill them.

368
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,790
The reason is simple.

369
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,600
Even someone like me

370
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,280
shouldn't have

371
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,630
an ally like you.

372
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,990
If I had killed you

373
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,510
back then,

374
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,310
Sword Sect

375
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,750
wouldn't have known you betrayed them.

376
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,790
They would only think the people of the Yuan Yi Palace

377
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,910
killed the people of Sword Sect again.

378
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,710
Xu Chonghua,

379
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,270
you should thank Sword Sect

380
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,600
for keeping you alive for a few more hours.

381
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,590
Take care of Qiushui for me.

382
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,990
Seven.

383
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,650
Sixth Brother,

384
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,110
I've never wanted to defeat you.

385
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,990
He deserved it.

386
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,310
It has nothing to do with you.

387
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,190
It's almost over.

388
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,630
You can leave.

389
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,990
We want to take everyone

390
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,090
in the Asura Field and prisons with us.

391
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,490
What if I don't agree?

392
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,750
You won't stop us.

393
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,570
Because the people in the Asura Field

394
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,100
are just like the past you.

395
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,270
I advise you to leave

396
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,450
before I change my mind.

397
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,080
Seven, be careful with his Eye Magic!

398
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,100
Why did you help me?

399
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,330
You're the one Sister Ye cares about.

400
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,660
I won't hurt you.

401
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,070
She saved me.

402
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,950
I promised her

403
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,350
I won't kill innocent people again.

404
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,230
You saw her?

405
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,710
She came to the Yuan Yi Palace?

406
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,590
Chang Wujue suffered a disturbance of the inner balance.

407
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,790
He invited her to come here to treat him.

408
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,920
The golden needles...

409
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,150
They really are her golden needles.

410
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,430
Why did she come

411
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,890
to such a dangerous place?

412
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,230
Considering her condition,

413
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,430
how could she take it?

414
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,350
Where is she now?

415
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,480
Did she get hurt?

416
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,110
I asked Miao Kong.

417
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,790
He said

418
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,920
Miao Feng has taken her away.

419
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,800
♫A cup of wine, a toast to the world, as wind and snow knock on the door♫

420
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,010
I think they went back to the Apothecary Valley.

421
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,910
♫Sigh for love and hate, leaving no trace upon the palm♫

422
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,670
♫Life drifts like dust, when will we meet again?♫

423
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,370
Fifth Brother,

424
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,370
I'll leave this to you.

425
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,910
Take Sixth Brother

426
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:05,290
♫From vibrant warmth to icy cold, it's just a single turn away♫

427
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,890
back to Sword Sect too.

428
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,950
Okay.

429
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:12,520
♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

430

432
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500

♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

Huo...

454

Chief Xue.

455
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,970
You're finally awake.

456
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,510
Ya Mi.

457
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,200
It's me.

458
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,500
Look.

459

Light.

♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

Is there a doctor here?

489

Sir.

490
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,850
Is there a doctor here?

491

This...

492
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,370
I need a doctor.

493

Get lost!

494
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,440
What... What happened?

495
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,360
I'm a doctor.

496
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,600
You're a doctor?

497
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,910
Take a look at her.

498
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,270
Take a look at her!

499
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,350
Save her.

500
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,350
Save her.

501
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,949
Please.

502
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,310
I can't save her.

You're a doctor.

504

Are you going to let her die?

505
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,710
Let her die?

506
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,949
She already died.

507
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,530
So I can't save her.

508
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,480
What did you say?

509
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,139
She was poisoned by the Soul Devouring Powder.

510
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,139
It's been four hours since she died.

511

Her hands are still warm.

512
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,320
I guess you have continuously

513
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,630
infused her with the primordial energy along the way

514
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,910
to keep her body warm

515
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,200
as if she were alive.

516
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,430
No!

517
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,130
Even though she was poisoned by the Soul Devouring Powder,

518
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,730
it won't take effect so soon.

519
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,700
You're lying!

520
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,400
She didn't die because of the Soul Devouring Powder.

521
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,590
Look at the Lianquan Acupuncture Point

522
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,390
on her throat.

523
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,950
Why?

524
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,680
Why?

525
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,550
Why?

526
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,550
Why?

527
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,110
After seven days of poisoning,

528
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,040
she would lose her consciousness.

529
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,430
The needle

530
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,390
pierced her Lianquan Acupuncture Point

531
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,910
accurately and deeply.

532
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,470
Don't be too sad.

533
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,630
When she died,

534
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,160
she didn't suffer too much.

535
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,990
She probably didn't want

536
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,670
to end up like that.

537
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,430
She must have been

538
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,660
a very proud woman.

539
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,390
I promised to take you

540
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,120
back to the Apothecary Valley.

541
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,350
I told you I would protect you.

542
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,590
Ziye?

543
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,690
Ziye.

544
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,220
I'm sorry.

545
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,660
I'm late.

546
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,480
Were you blaming me?

547
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,450
You silly girl.

548
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Who allowed you to leave the valley?

549
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,430
Weren't you aware

550
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,690
of your own condition?

551
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,530
You always thought about saving others,

552
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,290
bringing Xuehuai back to life, and saving Mo.

553
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,510
You always thought about saving them

554
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,510
and saving Seven!

555
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,310
What about yourself?

556
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,240
Didn't you care

557
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,610
about your own health?

558
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,550
God.

559
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,230
God!

560
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,390
My disciple was only in her 20s.

561
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,790
She had suffered enough in her life.

562
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,950
Why do you treat her so unfairly?

563
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,590
Why do you treat her so unfairly?

564
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,550
When I saw you back then,

565
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,430
you were also this cold.

566
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,310
Is Chief Xue back?

567
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,070
Is Chief Xue back?
