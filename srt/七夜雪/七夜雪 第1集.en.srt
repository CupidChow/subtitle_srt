No, no, I don't blame you.

524
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,600
If there's anyone to blame,

525
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,470
I should blame myself

526
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,410
for not expecting

527
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,410
such a handsome man to come tonight.

528
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,540
I even wanted to close the gate early.

529
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
I came at the dead of night

530
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,160
to request for Chief Xue's consultation.

531
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,040
For such a minor wound,

532
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,480
don’t bother the chief.

533
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,030
Let me take a look.

534
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,260
Thank you, Chief Xue.

535
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,880
But I’m not the patient.

536
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,630
You recognize me?

537
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,830
I heard Apothecary Valley's Chief Xue

538
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,090
is greedy and lustful.

539
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,590
I don't know about greedy,

540
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,030
but you seem

541
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,840
to be lustful indeed.

542
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,310
I just didn't expect

543
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,590
you'd be interested in

544
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,750
a down-and-out person like me.

545
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,950
I didn’t see clearly

546
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,170
with the dark clouds.

547
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,150
Now that I have a closer look,

548
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,530
you're quite average.

549
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,290
Since you're not the patient,

550
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,580
you should leave now.

551
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,320
I won't send you off. Bye.

552
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,860
The patient is on his way.

553
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,140
He'll be here soon.

554
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,790
Wait?

555
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,950
Only others

556
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,790
wait for me.

557
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,430
You're the first to expect me

558
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,510
to wait for others.

559
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,870
And the fee of 100,000 gold taels

560
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,870
will be here soon.

561
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,040
It's past midnight.

562
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,310
Your Fate-Reversal Token has been voided.

563
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,190
Please leave.

564
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,670
Chief Xue.

565
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,030
It was still 10 p.m. when I came up the mountain.

566
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,440
It took only half an hour.

567
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,960
I doubt it's already midnight.

568
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,150
What?

569
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,110
Mr. Huo,

570
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,950
if I don't agree,

571
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,210
will you try to kill me?

572
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,220
I dare not.

573
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,670
Since you recognize me,

574
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,190
you must know

575
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,670
what Sword Sect is like.

576
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,410
I won't be so rude.

577
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,470
But...

578
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,080
It's the New Year's.

579
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,830
It's bustling with reunions everywhere.

580
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,670
The two of us

581
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,570
are alone on a snowy night.

582
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,170
It’s also fate to meet each other.

583
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,250
May I invite you

584
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,120
to enjoy the snow with me?

585
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,990
Chief Xue!

586
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,950
Are you going to

587
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,880
just let him die?

588
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,630
He's not here.

589
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,230
Why is it my fault?

590
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,410
It's my rule to

591
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,750
observe a time limit.

592
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,110
It's his fate

593
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,870
that he can't be treated.

594
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,330
When there's a will, there's a way!

595
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,680
I'd like to see

596
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,310
if you have enough human will

597
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,270
to cause fate to change.

598
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,430
I will make you

599
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,250
take in Mo.

600
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,850
How dare he break into Apothecary Valley?

601
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,230
Even the huge valley gate

602
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,330
couldn't stop him.

603
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,470
Activate the Snow Hail Formation.

604
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,910
Yes.

605
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,390
This formation has many traps.

606
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,280
No one has ever overcome it.

607
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,750
He's really full of himself.

608
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,150
Anesthetic powder?

609
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,630
How could he overcome

610
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,480
the Snow Hail Formation so easily?

611
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,670
Apothecary Valley has been established for nearly a century.

612
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,460
We've seen many impressive martial artists.

613
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,660
But he's the first one

614
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,190
to overcome the formation.

615
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,590
If he takes a step closer,

616
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,090
we'll have to end his life.

617
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,050
He overcame the Snow Hail Formation.

618
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,150
Why isn't he breaking into this gate?

619
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,080
He just wanted to prove to me that

620
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,220
human will can surpass fate.

621
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,070
If he wants to come in,

622
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,590
no one can stop him.

623
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,360
He is so reckless.

624
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,940
Let's teach him a lesson.

625
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,150
He is determined.

626
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,800
It's pointless to stop him.

627
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,040
I challenged the formation

628
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,000
because I'm desperate.

629
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,950
Please forgive me

630
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,150
if I've offended you.

631
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,590
I just hope

632
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,370
you'll treat the patient.

633
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,520
I'll be eternally grateful

634
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,990
and indebted to you.

635
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,070
In the future,

636
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,150
I'll be at your disposal.

637
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,230
Chief Xue.

638
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,550
You've asked me for treatment repeatedly.

639
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,950
But the patient is still

640
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,710
not here.

641
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,450
You risked your life for him for nothing.

642
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,390
He's here.

643
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,150
That is the person you'd sacrifice your life

644
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,280
to save?

645
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,910
If possible,

646
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,720
I'm willing to pay with my life.

647
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,460
What pointless words.

648
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,550
If you can

649
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,630
really trade your life

650
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,240
for another person's life,

651
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,630
there wouldn't be so many

652
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,950
in agony and despair.

653
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,230
Besides,

654
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,390
you're attempting the impossible.

655
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,350
Is it really worth it?

656
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,740
Has anyone ever overcome

657
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,910
the Snow Hail Formation?

658
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,390
No.

659
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,990
You won't know

660
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,110
before you try.

661
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,590
Junior.

662
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,760
Chief Xue is at the door.

663
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:03,990
Chief Xue.

664
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,190
I’m Qiushui Yin, the daughter

665
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,350
of Celestial Alp Sect's chief Qiushui He.

666
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,630
Please save my child.

667
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,350
If my child survives,

668
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,810
Celestial Alp Sect will thank you properly.

669
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,290
No wonder you worked so hard just now.

670
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,750
You're a good father.

671
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,210
Mo is not my son,

672
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,540
but he's akin to one.

673
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,850
Please, Chief Xue.

674
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,470
Please, Chief Xue.

675
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,670
Please save my child.

676
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,790
Chief Xue,

677
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,440
please treat the child.

678
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,670
Chief Xue!

679
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,350
Chief Xue!

680
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,120
This is the first Fate-Reversal Token

681
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,270
of the year.
