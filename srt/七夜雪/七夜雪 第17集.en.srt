You've been spacing out a lot lately.

Did you not sleep well?

would you have waited for me to die

After you go down the mountain tomorrow night,

162

bring back some interesting

No problem.

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,430
A few days ago,

167

175
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,390

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,190
Go.

179
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,430
Chief.

180
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,670
I don't like

181
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,000
crowded places anyway.

182
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,270
I'll stay in the valley

183
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:53,990
with you.

184
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,250
-Weâ€¦
-Shuang Hong.

185
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,480
You'll go with them.

186
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,100
And you.

187
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,830
You'll go too.

188
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,500
Don't disturb me in the valley.

189
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Since Chief is weak

190
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,960
and can't leave the valley,

191
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,310
we'll buy all things in town

192
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,340
and bring them back.

193
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,620
It's not that easy.

194
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,100
Chief just learned that

195
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,780
there's more to the massacre.

196
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,700
It's a festival of reunion.

197
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,030
I bet she misses her family

198
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,960
in the Mo Family Village even more.

199
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,670
Thenâ€¦

200
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,900
Ladies.

201
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,930
I have an idea.

202
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,890
How do you feel?

203
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,390
The Five Sages of Yuan Yi Palace,

204
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,950
except for Miao Feng,

205
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,590
were all once locked here.

206
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,650
What are you trying to say?

207
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,430
Nothing.

208
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,670
I'm just curious

209
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,520
whether you are a human

210
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,230
or a monster.

211
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,990
Any human

212
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,820
will have a mental breakdown

213
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,890
after being locked in a dog cage.

214
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,520
But if you're a monster,

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,780
things are different.

216
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,070
To me,

217
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,770
you seem very calm.

218
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,630
I know what you're thinking.

219
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,950
What do you want?

220
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,290
You had the guts to ask for the Asura Field,

221
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,390
so you definitely won't settle for

222
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,150
staying in a dog cage.

223
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,770
So cute.

224
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,670
Look at this.

225
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,800
This one is good too.

226
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,220
Here, I've wrapped it for you.

227
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,150
So beautiful.

228
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,140
I like it.

229
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,710
Look. This basket is very useful.

230
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,350
Chief.

231
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,730
Take a look at the lanterns.

232
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,660
There are red ones and yellow ones.

233
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,950
Chief, Chief, look.

234
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,070
Chief, this is for you.

235
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,050
Chief, look at this.

236
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,650
And this.

237
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,420
Chief, look how beautiful this is.

238
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,220
And these two.

239
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,290
Chief, take this.

240
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,430
And this.

241
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,870
Chief, let me put it on for you.

242
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,260
Here.

243
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,150
Chief.

244
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,430
There's a surprise later.

245
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,960
Let's go.

246
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,470
Go.

247
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,510
Candied haws!

248
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,070
Sweet and sour candied haws!

249
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,630
Look.

250
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,190
Miss,

251
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,930
can I pay my debt

252
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,190
with candied haws?

253
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,590
Yes, yes!

254
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm afraid

255
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,470
all your candied haws together

256
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,470
can just pay a tiny part of your debt.

257
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,480
Every little bit counts.

258
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,710
What do you think?

259
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,070
There are many other interesting things.

260
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,230
Would you like to take a look around?

261
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,870
Go, Chief.

262
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,270
Go. Go.

263
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,350
Go and take a look.

264
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,030
Go.

265
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,320
With all this hubbub in the valley,

266
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,020
I don't think I can get any sleep.

267
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,350
I'll take a look around.

268
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,620
Chief, Chief.

269
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,290
Xiao Cheng.

270
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,640
Hand them out for me.

271
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,359
Mine, they're all mine.

272
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,190
No way.

273
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,990
Mine!

274
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,869
Slow down.

275
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,790
I want one too.

276
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,430
Give me one.

277
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,030
Slow down.

278
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,829
No, no.

279
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,990
Everyone gets one.

280
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,069
-Everyone gets one.
-Don't grab it!

281
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,270
-Give it back to me!
-Don't grab it!

282
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,030
Give it to me.

283
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,750
Chief, this is for you.

284
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,589
Nice work.

285
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,790
Chief Xue.

286
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,910
Great to see you!

287
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,670
Mr. Li.

288
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,070
You came too.

289
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,630
Yeah.

290
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,430
Have a sweet potato.

291
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,550
It's hot

292
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,850
and can warm you up.

293
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,350
It's too hot.

294
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,910
Let me hold it for her.

295
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,350
Okay.

296
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,790
It smells so good.

297
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,790
Thank you, Mr. Li.

298
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,910
Take care.

299
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,750
Chief Xue, choose a sugar figure.

300
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,910
Any type will do.

301
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,750
Can you draw someone

302
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,610
that's fierce

303
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,670
and ugly?

304
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,930
Chief, who are you talking about?

305
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,830
Wellâ€¦

306
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,710
Why are you looking at me?

307
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,830
Here.

308
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,160
There's indeed a resemblance.

309
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,550
I doubt that.

310
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,070
It's not even half as handsome as me.

311
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,470
Chief, Chief.

312
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,470
Chief, have a try.

313
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,310
Here, try it.

314
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,360
Give it a try.

315
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,190
Come on.

316
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,710
Do it.

317
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,750
You hit it!

318
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,390
Amazing!

319
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,800
Chief, you're amazing.

320
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,110
Chief.

321
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,390
Chief.

322
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,790
Come and try this.

323
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,890
It's freshly made.

324
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,950
It's freshly made.

325
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,860
Sticky rice cakes.

326
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,630
Didn't you say

327
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,820
the freshly made ones are the best?

328
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,250
Eat as many as you want.

329
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,470
Chief.

330
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,430
The sticky rice cake is chewy with a soft filling.

331
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,430
It's hard to make.

332
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,270
The freshly made ones

333
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,680
are the most delicious.

334
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,580
Xiao Cheng.

335
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,190
How's it?

336
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,640
Does it taste the same as when you were little?

337
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,580
I'm afraid it's so delicious

338
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,090
because I haven't eaten it in a long time.

339
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,400
It reminds me of the Mo Family Village.

340
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,270
During festivals,

341
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,870
many families

342
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,750
wanted me to celebrate with them.

343
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,110
I know.

344
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,000
They didn't want me to feel lonely.

345
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,390
Festivals

346
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,910
should be celebrated with family and friends.

347
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,910
It's no fun celebrating them alone.

348
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,270
If you like it,

349
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,360
I'll invite them to the Apothecary Valley

350
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,910
to celebrate this festival with you

351
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,750
every year.

352
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,630
How much money did you spend

353
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,370
to persuade the villagers

354
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,990
to move the market to the Apothecary Valley?

355
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,070
Not a dime.

356
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,710
Did you put everything

357
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,710
on the account

358
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,210
of the Apothecary Valley?

359
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,990
The villagers living nearby

360
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,790
have been grateful to you

361
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,000
for your treatment.

362
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,290
As soon as I said it,

363
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,170
they agreed without hesitation.

364
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,510
By the way,

365
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,750
why don't I remember

366
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,110
any villagers in the town

367
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,840
who can make sticky rice cakes?

368
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,910
There's none

369
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,790
in this town,

370
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,160
so I went to the villages nearby

371
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,430
to visit all the vendors

372
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,160
who can make sticky rice cakes.

373
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,190
Inviting them over

374
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,320
did cost some money.

375
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,080
But don't worry.

376
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,170
I paid them with my wine money.

377
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,960
You love wine so much.

378
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm surprised that you spent your wine money on someone else.

379
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,190
You're not someone else.

380
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,790
I'm in debt to you.

381
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,230
Did youâ€¦

382
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,680
prepare that too?

383
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,350
Thank you.

384
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,230
Do you know why Kunlun roses

385
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,090
are so precious?

386
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,960
No.

387
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,310
Normal roses

388
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,670
bloom three times a year.

389
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,590
And Kunlun roses

390
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,590
only bloom once a year.

391
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,160
One second, they bloom.

392
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,970
The next second, they die.

393
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,310
The most dazzling moment

394
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,590
is evanescent.

395
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,630
Those people

396
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,110
were just trash.

397
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,550
Now that they can nourish

398
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,590
my flowers

399
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,590
and witness that fleeting moment

400
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,910
of splendor,

401
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,990
their lives are worth it.

402
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,790
Eye.

403
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,910
You should know

404
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,040
the rules in the Palace.

405
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,110
The capable rise.

406
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,090
The inept fall.

407
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,480
If I let you down again,

408
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,120
you can kill me.

409
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,790
You may leave.

410
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,750
Yes.

411
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,930
Today's rose

412
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,980
is particularly gorgeous.

413
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,670
Doctrine Leader.

414
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
You're so beautiful.

415
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,340
Let me take a closer look at you.

416
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,210
No, Doctrine Leader!

417
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,320
Envoy Miao Feng.

418
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,390
Has anyone ever told you

419
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,430
that your smile

420
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,680
is disgusting?

421
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,430
What a beautiful face.

422
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,390
Envoy Miao Shui!

423
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,750
Get out.

424
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,710
Get out!

425
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

426
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,030
The pulse is the first indication of the state of Qi and blood.

427
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,150
Qi and blood can be sufficient or deficient.

428
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,100
There can be an excess in organs.

429
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,950
When Qi and blood are both sufficient,

430
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,030
the pulse, Yin, and Yang are all strong.

431
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,510
When Qi and blood are both deficient,

432
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,570
the pulse, Yin, and Yang are all weak.

433
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,950
Chief.

434
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,350
What are you reading?

435
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,910
Treatise on Febrile Diseases Caused by Cold.

436
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,550
Febrile diseases are different from cold damage.

437
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,210
You need toâ€¦

438
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,220
Identify the six-meridian pattern for cold damage.

439
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,390
â™«Who is brewing the medicine, as the fragrance slowly filters through the window?â™«

440
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,510
Focus on organs for febrile diseases and internal injuries.

441
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,790
Chief, I understand.

442
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,070
â™«You lower your gaze, grinding herbs, your hand gently brushing my woundâ™«

443
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,550
You've improved a lot.

444
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,900
â™«Following your eyes, I see the flowers fall softly into my palmâ™«

445
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,910
Thank you, Chief.

446
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,390
Keep reading.

447
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,140
â™«I wish to speak, yet my thoughts remain unspokenâ™«

448
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,540
â™«White moonlight peers over the courtyard walls, spreading frost upon the groundâ™«

449
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,550
Chief.

450
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,340
â™«The night is long, and you adorn yourself behind the gauzeâ™«

451
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,140
Chief.

452
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,330
â™«The swaying shadows of the trees stir my heartâ™«

453
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,950
Chief.

454
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,110
You're still sick.

455
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,830
Let me do it.

456
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,740
â™«As we share stories of our pastsâ™«

457
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,290
Xiao Cheng.

458
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,300
I haven't tested you

459
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,890
â™«Beneath the starlightâ™«

460
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,750
in a long time.

461
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,870
Chief.

462
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,390
I've been studying hard recently.

463
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,550
Ask whatever you want.

464
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,060
Okay.

465
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,490
â™«We exchange glances, like medicine simmering slowly over timeâ™«

466
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,730
You asked for it.

467
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,670
The Angelica Blood-Supplementing Decoction

468
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,070
has angelica in its name,

469
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,160
â™«In the dim light, the person in my dream remains sereneâ™«

470
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,160
but in practice,

471
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,390
the wrong proportion of herbs

472
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,120
can greatly affect the effect.

473
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,950
Why is that?

474
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,100
â™«Your dark hair cascades over your white robesâ™«

475
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,300
I know.

476
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,150
The Angelica Blood-Supplementing Decoction

477
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,510
has angelica in its name,

478
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,750
but actually, astragalus is the main herb.

479
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,870
â™«From this moment on, the distance between us will be as long as time itselfâ™«

480
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,790
The dosage of astragalus

481
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,230
is five times more than angelica's.

482
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,970
â™«New medicine heals old wounds, aged wine cools with timeâ™«

483
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,710
That has two reasons.

484
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,230
First,

485
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,310
heavy use of astragalus replenishes the Yang energy that has been depleted from external causes.

486
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,120
â™«A melody fills the air, and the one before me stands unmatchedâ™«

487
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,990
Second, it can help create tangible blood

488
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,350
from intangible Qi.

489
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,270
You've really improved.

490
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,520
â™«The evening breeze invites the sunset, and rouge gently blushes beneath the moonâ™«

491
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,870
Since you've studied so hard,

492
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,990
I'll tell them to make a braised pork knuckle for you tonight.

493
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,820
â™«Though fate is uncertain, I shall always remember your faceâ™«

494
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,750
Thank you, Chief.

495
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,350
Chief.

496
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,550
Chief.

497
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,320
Look. I picked them.

498
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,150
You need to be careful with how you pick this herb.

499
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,590
Keep only the tip

500
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,840
and remove the core.

501
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,130
Don't confuse the two.

502
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,470
Exactly what I did.

503
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,230
You're rarely so meticulous, Feng Lyu.

504
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,960
Good.

505
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,160
Chief.

506
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,110
I promise

507
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,710
I'll always be so meticulous.

508
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,820
That's great.

509
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,700
I can worry less.

510
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,510
Chief.

511
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,370
Give me the finished ones.

512
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,180
Okay.

513
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,550
Chief.

514
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,950
Chief Xue.

515
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,470
Chief Xue.

516
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,310
I want to ask you for a favor.

517
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,950
What is it?

518
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,470
I want you

519
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,950
to teach me how to identify

520
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,080
detoxifying herbs.

521
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,750
If I get bitten by snakes or insects,

522
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,750
I can save myself.

523
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,470
You just saw me

524
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,750
walking around the valley

525
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,480
and not being needed anywhere,

526
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,270
so you want to find me something to do,

527
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,790
right?

528
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,890
Chief Xue, you misunderstood me.

529
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,710
Usually, those girls

530
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,850
can't answer any of my questions,

531
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,470
but today, they did everything perfectly.

532
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,190
I'm very happy.

533
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,710
It's all because

534
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,910
you taught them well.

535
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,510
You just have way too much time on your hands.

536
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,110
How about

537
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,640
I find you something to do?

538
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,270
Chief Xue.

539
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,770
Why did you bring me here?

540
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,970
Take down these lanterns.

541
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,670
Are you asking me to do that

542
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,120
because you think I have nothing else to do?

543
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,650
I'm not as obnoxious as you.

544
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,920
You hung those lanterns up,

545
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,150
so you need to

546
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,030
take them off.

547
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,150
You know it was me?

548
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,370
I haven't thanked you for it.

549
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,310
Without

550
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,050
your lanterns guiding me,

551
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,160
I wouldn't have found my way out.

552
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,190
Glad that you did.

553
00:33:49,750 --> 00:34:00,690
â™«Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is partingâ™«

554
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,670
In the blink of an eye,

555
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,390
it's been so many years.

556
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:08,380
â™«Plum blossoms are about to fall; I'll see you hereâ™«

557
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,219
â™«Why are you late and why is it about to snow again?â™«

558
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:20,449
â™«Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewellâ™«

559
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:27,560
â™«Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long nightâ™«

560
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:34,770
â™«After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moonâ™«

561
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,620
â™«Looking into the distance, speechless and sleeplessâ™«

562
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,700
You're removing them too?

563
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:12,460
â™«Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewellâ™«

564
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,170
I don't need them anymore.

565
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:19,560
â™«Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long nightâ™«

566
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:26,780
â™«After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moonâ™«

567
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,630
â™«Looking into the distance, speechless and sleeplessâ™«

568
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:44,810
â™«Longing etched in my heart, but I don't wish for your acknowledgement of my loveâ™«

569
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:52,330
â™«Asking the stars about our fate, as fireworks appear in my dreamâ™«

570
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,920
â™«I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with youâ™«

571
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:06,920
â™«I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with youâ™«

572
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,210
I hope you can soon find

573
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,540
the secret of life in it.

574
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,670
Master.

575
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,990
Today, I finally

576
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,230
understand your intention.

577
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,880
What's wrong?

578
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,340
Nothing.

579
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,800
Since we're here,

580
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,380
how about

581
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,350
I take you to a place?

582
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,350
It took me days

583
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,680
to finally find the best place in the valley

584
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,070
to watch the sunset.

585
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,430
So beautiful.

586
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,590
It's not far from where

587
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,050
I collect Rootless Water.

588
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,110
But I've never been here.

589
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,080
I never knew

590
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,790
there was such a view here.

591
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,920
It's not too late to know it now.

592
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,890
The mist is like a brocade.

593
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,890
How dreamy and beautiful.

594
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,800
From here,

595
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,230
the view stretches far and wide,

596
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,750
and the sky is dazzlingly beautiful.

597
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,880
Such a fine prospect

598
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,150
makes one feel more open.

599
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,030
In the past,

600
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,390
when patients came to the valley for treatment,

601
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,750
I'd treat them.

602
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,810
Without patients,

603
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,190
I'd seek the truth

604
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,670
and try to awaken Xuehuai.

605
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,850
Day after day, I became used to it.

606
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,640
I really didn't know

607
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,630
what else

608
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,830
I could do.

609
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,070
But just now,

610
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,120
I suddenly had an idea.

611
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,390
Maybe

612
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,750
I should live for myself.

613
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
There are many

614
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,670
poisons without antidotes

615
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,920
and incurable diseases in this world.

616
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,960
I need to improve my medical skills

617
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,900
and write medical books.

618
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,670
Also,

619
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,230
I always hope that Shuang Hong and the others

620
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,090
can complete their training soon

621
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,050
and treat patients in far-off places for me.

622
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,350
If possible,

623
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,990
I hope one day

624
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,490
I can cure myself

625
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,940
so I can visit different places.

626
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,950
So,

627
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,590
there are still a lot of things

628
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,870
you need to do.

629
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,030
But I believe

630
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,230
no matter what you want to do,

631
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,710
with your talent,

632
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,810
you can definitely make it in the end.

633
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,310
How about you?

634
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,550
I'll get the fifth herb

635
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,350
for Mo first, of course.

636
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,830
I mean for yourself.

637
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,490
For myself?

638
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,670
I swore when I was little

639
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,950
to uphold justice

640
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,440
and help the weak.

641
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,150
Later, roaming the martial world,

642
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,480
I joined the Sword Sect.

643
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,890
I've always been doing what I wanted to do

644
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,890
at the beginning.

645
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,950
To be honest,

646
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,350
after I met you,

647
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,430
I had a new wish.

648
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,670
What is it?

649
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,550
In the past,

650
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,110
I helped people in danger

651
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,640
but only saved their lives.

652
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,230
Later, I saw how you treated your patients.

653
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,890
You not only saved their lives

654
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,650
but also healed their hearts.

655
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,320
I wish to do the same.

656
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,350
I want to help people in need

657
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,970
and bring peace to this world.

658
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,830
I want to get rid of all the bad guys

659
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,030
in the martial world.

660
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,630
I'll do my best

661
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,930
to make people in the world

662
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,470
suffer less

663
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,350
and have more joy.

664
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,390
In that case,

665
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,030
it's because of me

666
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,510
that you have that wish.

667
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,850
Shouldn't you pay me for that?

668
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,640
Is the beautiful view before your eyes

669
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,070
payment enough?

670
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:51,950
You owe me.
