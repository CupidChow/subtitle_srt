Chief Xue.

It’s time to go.

8
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,230
Don't burn it!

Don't burn it!

Stop. Don't burn it.

Mo still needs them when he wakes up.

He still wants to plays with them.

what did I gain?

35
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,750
To compete with Huo Zhanbai

36
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,210
for the position of chief,

37
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,710
I've lost my family and my son.

Chief Xue.

39
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,990
You play the flute very well.

40
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,330
Do you only know this song?

41
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,360
It's not a flute.

42
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,800
It's a reed pipe.

43
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,510
It's an instrument from the Western Region.

44
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,510
The person who gave me this reed pipe

45
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,350
only taught me this song.

No.

you can play a song with the reed pipe.

74
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,630
The homeland will hear it.

75
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,530
I'll teach you.

76
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,110
Watch carefully.

77
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,710
Chief Xue.

78
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,940
Let's rest here.

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,190

85
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,030
and has been freezing for too long.

86
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,390
He needs to get his temperature back

87
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,450
before he wakes up.

88
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,670
Hurry.

89
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,430
Take him to this inn

90
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,550
to avoid the cold.

91
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,110
Hurry!

92
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,020
Help him!

93
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,430
What are you waiting for?

94
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,210
Let me do it.

95
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,740
Envoy Miao Feng, your palm strength was formidable.

96
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm sure you have a strong inner force.

97
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,030
May I

98
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,510
borrow your internal force?

99
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,710
I’m at your disposal.

100
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,110
Okay.

101
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,960
Help me inject internal force into him,

102
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,750
and I'll use acupuncture

103
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,290
to salvage his energy.

104
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,260
Okay.

105
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,500
Sir, you're awake.

106
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,740
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

107
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,670
Just let me know.

108
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,430
I'm good.

109
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,230
I passed by here

110
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,790
and ran into a robber.

111
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,670
I thought I was dead for sure.

112
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,230
I'm glad I met you two.

113
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,480
Thank you.

114
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,750
Thank you.

115
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,720
I dare not take full credit.

116
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,990
It's mainly thanks to him.

117
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,390
Thank you.

118
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,510
Thank you.

119
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,360
You are always calm.

120
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,990
I thought

121
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,540
you were a peaceful person.

122
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,070
But your body has already

123
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,890
reacted to this searing pain.

124
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,080
Why do you still

125
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,120
look so calm

126
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,870
and remain smiling?

127
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,370
Those who practice the Spring Breeze

128
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,980
cannot be emotional.

129
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,920
Humans are not plants.

130
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,570
What did you go through

131
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,200
to become so

132
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,490
emotionless like you?

133
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,910
I just trained hard.

134
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,710
Trained hard?

135
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,560
I'm afraid

136
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,040
they were some inhumane training.

137
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,230
What kind of hell-like place

138
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,470
is Yuan Yi Palace

139
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,510
to make normal people

140
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,960
develop such abnormal habits?

141
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,910
Mr. Huo.

142
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,630
Thank you.

143
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,790
Seventh Brother.

144
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,950
Didn't you ask me

145
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,630
to keep an eye on Yuan Yi Palace?

146
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,430
A few days ago,

147
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,110
the Sun Saintess Wuma's rebellion failed.

148
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,670
Yuan Yi Palace is heavily guarded.

149
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,470
I will continue to investigate.

150
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,350
Seven.

151
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,430
Senior.

152
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,190
An important task from the Sword Sect?

153
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,990
That's right.

154
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,680
All these years,

155
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,470
Chang Wujue has been using force and fear

156
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,600
to restrain his men.

157
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,030
He forced the Three Saintess,

158
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,690
Five Sages,

159
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,150
and thousands of followers

160
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,230
to submit to him.

161
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,670
The Yuan Yi Palace rebellion

162
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,850
must have been caused by something.

163
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,590
Senior,

164
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,550
I have a request.

165
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,580
We need to gather the power of the Seven Swords

166
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,350
to encircle and suppress the Yuan Yi Palace this time.

167
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,950
I wonder if Fifth Brother...

168
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,980
This concerns the safety of the people.

169
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,830
It depends on Fengxing.

170
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,390
If he agrees,

171
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,840
I will.

172
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,720
That's great.

173
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,230
Thank you.

174
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,350
Mr. Huo.

175
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,170
Something happened to Madam.

176
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,230
Junior.

177
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,190
Junior!

178
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,530
What happened?

179
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,790
I... I don't know.

180
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,690
Go get my medicine bag.

181
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,430
Yes.

182
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,359
She took poison.

183
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,770
She looks pale and sickly,

184
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,150
and her fingers are bruising.

185
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,210
She drank the Gut-Rupturing powder.

186
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,770
Fortunately, we noticed in time.

187
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,230
The poison hasn't penetrated the internal organs.

188
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,140
She'll be fine if

189
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,200
she can puke it out.

190
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,270
Why did you save me?

191
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,350
You shouldn't have saved me.

192
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,390
Junior.

193
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,950
Seven.

194
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,870
We both know that

195
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,630
Mrs. Qiushui wants to die.

196
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,170
Even if she wakes up later,

197
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,190
she might attempt to

198
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,190
commit suicide again in the future.

199
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,110
Right now,

200
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,600
we have to take turns taking care of her.

201
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,030
Okay.

202
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,430
I'll multitask and also oversee

203
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,010
the matters of the Sword Sect.

204
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,410
I'll leave when Junior is

205
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,380
doing better.

206
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,650
I'll go prescribe some medicine.

207
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,230
We need to get rid of the remaining poison

208
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,550
as soon as possible.

209
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,030
When the medicine is done,

210
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,090
get her to drink it.

211
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:02,990
Okay.

212
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,390
Thank you.

213
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,830
Mr. Huo.

214
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,110
Thanks for your help.

215
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,710
Send the letter as soon as possible.

216
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,110
Yes.

217
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,080
I hope the six swords

218
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,590
can reply as soon as they receive the letter.

219
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,790
Then, we can reunite as soon as possible

220
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,200
and discuss how to destroy Yuan Yi Palace.

221
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,310
Senior.

222
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,630
Is she awake?

223
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,910
Yes.

224
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,280
I'll go check on her.

225
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,850
No need.

226
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,150
She just said she doesn't want to see anyone.

227
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,210
Give her some time.

228
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,880
I just persuaded her

229
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,230
to take the medicine

230
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,230
in the afternoon.

231
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,230
Regardless,

232
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,280
it's good that she can drink it.

233
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,750
She does need some time.

234
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,710
I hope she can come to terms with things.

235
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,470
When you settle down Mrs. Qiushui

236
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,500
and deal with the matters of the Sword Sect,

237
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,550
will you go to the Apothecary Valley

238
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,680
to find my disciple?

239
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,390
I promised her

240
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:58,920
♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

241
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,290
to drink Laughing at the World together.

242
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,290
I asked Snow Harrier

243
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,670
to send a letter back to the valley.

244
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,270
It must have been delivered.

245
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,830
I wonder if that dumb bird

246
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,470
will remember to

247
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,610
♫Plum blossoms are about to fall; I'll see you here♫

248
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,750
ask her to reply to me.

249
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,960
Your dumb bird

250
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,430
is quite sensible.

251
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,310
It will understand your feelings.

252
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,460
♫Why are you late and why is it about to snow again?♫

253
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,710
I hope so.

254
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,680
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

255
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,010
Unfortunately, my disciple has a cold disease.

256
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,070
She can't be like me

257
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,420
and leave the valley whenever I want.

258
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,790
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

259
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,100
Senior.

260
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,510
Can her cold disease

261
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,310
be completely cured?

262
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:33,000
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

263
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,510
Now that the knot in her heart is gone,

264
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,030
although she cannot fully recover,

265
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,640
some good rest and recuperation

266
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,840
can improve her health greatly.

267
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,850
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

268
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,110
But...

269
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,950
She needs to recuperate for many years.

270
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,230
As long as it can be cured,

271
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,710
it doesn't matter how long it takes.

272
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,070
Some day,

273
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,460
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

274
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,190
I'll be able to see

275
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,690
the beauty of this world with her.

276
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,560
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

277
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,780
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

278
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,630
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

279
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:42,250
♫Longing etched in my heart, but I don't wish for your acknowledgement of my love♫

280
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,650
Right now,

281
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,630
are you also looking at the moon?

282
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:50,370
♫Asking the stars about our fate, as fireworks appear in my dream♫

283
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,560
♫I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with you♫

284
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:04,970
♫I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with you♫

285
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,510
Chief Xue.

286
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,220
Are you feeling better?

287
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,750
Chief Xue?

288
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,590
Chief Xue!

289
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,680
Chief Xue!

290
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,550
Chief Xue.

291
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,360
You would not have guessed that

292
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,680
you're suffering from the cold disease

293
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,190
because of me.

294
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,410
That's enough.

295
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,030
Not enough.

296
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,570
Spring Breeze is extremely exhausting.

297
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,830
If you faint,

298
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,110
I can't save you.

299
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,560
I just didn't expect

300
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,230
your body

301
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,240
to be this weak.

302
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,020
But don't worry.

303
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,240
Going forward, I'll transfer some primordial energy

304
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,500
to you every two hours.

305
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,990
With you around,

306
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,440
I don't have to worry about myself.

307
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,230
Wait.

308
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,990
I'll get you a pill.

309
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,470
No need.

310
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,550
The wound on my abdomen

311
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,550
is almost healed.

312
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,430
It's not for the wound.

313
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,550
It's the medicine to cure the Ice Silkworm Poison.

314
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,860
I made this pill

315
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,030
three years ago.

316
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,990
It's most effective against the Ice Silkworm Poison.

317
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,070
Take this pill.

318
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,000
Even if your Ice Silkworm Poison

319
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,800
acts up again,

320
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,510
it wouldn't be as unbearable

321
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,230
as it is now.

322
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,200
Although you look calm,

323
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,310
your hands are trembling.

324
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,230
The tendons in your hand are rising.

325
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,030
No matter how much you endure it,

326
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,330
you can't hide your pain from a doctor.

327
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,920
Your Ice Silkworm Poison is acting up.

328
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,170
At this moment,

329
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,350
it feels like a hundred needles are piercing you from the inside.

330
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,550
It's chilling and painful,

331
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,200
right?

332
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,520
It hasn't even been a month.

333
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,130
The Ice Silkworm Poison

334
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,990
shouldn't have acted up so early.

335
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,950
Because you used

336
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,100
too much primordial energy just now.

337
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,350
That's why the Ice Silkworm Poison

338
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,480
acted up in advance.

339
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:25,910
Hurry.

340
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,490
Take the medicine.

341
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,670
No need.

342
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,070
Didn't you say you would

343
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,690
transfer primordial energy to me

344
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,650
every two hours?

345
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,110
How can you withstand such frequent

346
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,630
usage of your primordial energy?

347
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,230
Besides,

348
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,680
if the Ice Silkworm Poison acts up again,

349
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,390
you need to use your primordial energy to resolve it.

350
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,730
If you exhaust your primordial energy

351
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,610
to save my life,

352
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,790
how can you suppress the cold poison in your body?

353
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,420
The Ice Silkworm Poison is a mark bestowed upon me

354
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,750
by the Doctrine Leader.

355
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,950
It is my honor.

356
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,690
How can I let it go?

357
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,790
You are really crazy.

358
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,330
Doctrine Leader is a loner

359
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,030
who never trusts anyone.

360
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,510
If I weren't poisoned by the Ice Silkworm Poison

361
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,040
and relies on him for an antidote every month,

362
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,110
how could I

363
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,770
stay by his side and serve him?

364
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,610
The palace is full of vicious people.

365
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,070
I want to stay by his side.

366
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,350
So,

367
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,780
thank you for your kindness.

368
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,560
I just cannot accept it.

369
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,660
You're desperate

370
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,580
to protect someone.

371
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,600
I understand that feeling.

372
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,650
You don't have to feel bad about it.

373
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,330
If you come around one day,

374
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,890
I'll detoxify you.

375
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,390
This can temporarily

376
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,120
suppress the pain in your body.

377
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,640
Take a rest

378
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,440
before we get going.

379
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,910
Thank you, Chief Xue.

380
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,030
You don’t have to

381
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,230
thank me so politely.

382
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,570
I'm not your Doctrine Leader.

383
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,510
The weather is so bad

384
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,410
and his Ice Silkworm Poison is acting up.

385
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,720
If we don't hurry to Yuan Yi Palace,

386
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,590
I'm afraid I'll die on the way

387
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,510
before I can

388
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,590
see Mingjie.

389
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,590
Since the carriage has been overturned,

390
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,520
to arrive at Yuan Yi Palace in time,

391
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,510
why don't we ride the horses?

392
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,550
Okay.

393
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,780
But your health...

394
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,910
I’m fine.

395
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,710
If we're riding horses,

396
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,100
we can't bring so many things with us.

397
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,360
Let's pick the important ones and leave.

398
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,430
Okay.

399
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,110
I need to transfer energy to you regularly.

400
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,870
I’m afraid you and I

401
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,040
must ride the same horse

402
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,700
and always lean on each other.

403
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,750
If you're alright with that,

404
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,060
we’ll go like this.

405
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,560
Lean on me to rest

406
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,390
and I'll transfer you energy.

407
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,510
Transferring energy from you to me

408
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,110
is like a treatment of sorts.

409
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,510
Doctors don't care about

410
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,110
gender considerations during treatments.

411
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,370
Let us travel this way.

412
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,180
It’s snowing heavily.

413
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,440
I'll sit in front of you

414
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,950
to block some snow.

415
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,490
Are you still cold?

416
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,830
It's fine.

417
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,770
Focus on your journey.

418
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,790
I'll let you know

419
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,320
if I feel unwell.

420
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,590
Thank you.

421
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,680
Look, it's Snow Harrier.

422
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,430
Snow Harrier.

423
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,690
Why are you back alone?

424
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,230
Is this from Mr. Seven, for Chief?

425
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,620
But she's out of the valley.

426
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,550
She won't come back in a long while.

427
00:30:59,230 --> 00:30:59,870
Ziye.

428
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,740
I will be back soon.

429
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,070
Please

430
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,730
wait for me with warm wine.

431
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,670
When did Mr. Huo

432
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,790
write this?

433
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,010
Was it after meeting Chief Liao?

434
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,750
One chirp for yes,

435
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,760
two chirps for no.

436
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,350
Since he has met Chief Liao,

437
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,230
he must have known the truth.

438
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,230
According to the letter,

439
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,110
he wishes to drink with her.

440
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,080
As expected,

441
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,350
he doesn't blame Ziye.

442
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,750
Why would Mr. Seven

443
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,950
blame her at all?

444
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,820
Her prescription

445
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,790
saved Mo.

446
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,870
He should be thanking her

447
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,590
instead.

448
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,090
But Chief must have guessed that

449
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,620
Mr. Seven is craving wine.

450
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,230
So she asked Shuang Hong

451
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,820
to bury some Laughing at the World

452
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,960
under the plum tree.

453
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,590
But Chief

454
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,400
left without saying goodbye.

455
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,150
When she comes back,

456
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,550
I must nag at her about it.

457
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,800
Shuang Hong.

458
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,030
What's wrong?

459
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,320
Nothing.

460
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,150
I know.

461
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,960
What do you know?

462
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,250
You must be worried about Chief,

463
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,760
right?

464
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,390
I'm worried too.

465
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,230
The road to Suzhou is so far.

466
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,490
I hope that person

467
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,890
can take good care of her.

468
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,580
He will.

469
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,790
By the way,

470
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,960
let me write a letter back.

471
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,030
I have to tell Mr. Seven that

472
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,590
our Chief

473
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,660
is going to the Sword Sect.

474
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,230
Feng Lyu.

475
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,110
Go to the medicine hut

476
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,450
to check if Lan Lan's ointment

477
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,290
is ready.

478
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,710
Tell her to keep the flames small.

479
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,230
When the bubbles

480
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,150
turn from small to big ones,

481
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,320
she can take the pot off the flames.

482
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,070
Okay.

483
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,350
Shuang Hong.

484
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,240
You should write the reply.

485
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:50,590
Okay.

486
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,090
Miao Feng is currently

487
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,590
bringing a female doctor

488
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,850
back to Yuan Yi Palace.

489
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,390
You must stop him

490
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,510
on the way.

491
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,000
Don't let him bring

492
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,330
the female doctor back.

493
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,350
Remember,

494
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,660
Miao Feng can be killed...

495
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,620
But not the female doctor.

496
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,290
-Yes!
-Yes!

497
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,550
Chief Xue.

498
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,930
Can you hold on?

499
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,870
I'm fine.

500
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,200
When we arrive at the next post,

501
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
let's take a small break.

502
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:00,990
Chief Xue.

503
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,160
Are you okay?

504
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,840
Don't worry.

505
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,239
If we go further,

506
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,120
we'll arrive at Yueya Vale.

507
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,719
We can find

508
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,610
a resting place

509
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,630
and horse feeds there.

510
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,830
Okay.

511
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,280
Miao Feng!

512
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,870
Who are they?

513
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,949
Eight Elites of the Asura Field.

514
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,230
The Asura Field?

515
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,409
All Eight Elites are here.

516
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,240
What a big scene.

517
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,860
You are highly skilled.

518
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,050
Naturally, we have to be all here.

519
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,310
I know Eye sent you.

520
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Don't force me to kill you one by one.

521
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Come at me at once.

522
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,590
Eye?

523
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,630
It's him.

524
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,630
The arrow is poisoned.

525
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm fine.

526
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,910
Hurry.

527
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Take it.

528
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,120
It can suppress the poison.

529
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,410
You go to Yueya Vale first.

530
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,710
I'll hold them back.

531
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:28,840
But...

532
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:29,790
Run!

533
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,550
Why did Eye

534
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,590
send you all here?

535
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,720
Do you think I'm afraid?

536
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,630
Miao Feng.

537
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,130
I don't understand

538
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,790
why someone like you

539
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,470
would rather be the Doctrine Leader's dog.

540
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,510
Then why are you being

541
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,440
Eye's dog?

542
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,230
I don't think we need to understand each other.

543
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,350
As Eye's dog,

544
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,310
at least I won't live a miserable life.

545
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,540
Miao Feng.

546
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,910
I knew it.

547
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,170
You've been away from the Asura Field for too long.

548
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,790
You've even

549
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,380
forgotten your lethal strike.

550
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,720
My reed pipe!

551
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,080
One body is missing.

552
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,290
Feipian pretended to be dead.

553
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,340
You can still move?

554
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,910
It looks like

555
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,760
you can't hold on any longer.

556
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,950
I'm kind.

557
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,120
I won't let you suffer anymore.

558
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,830
Did Eye really

559
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,380
send you to kill me and Miao Feng?

560
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,110
Originally, Eye said

561
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,890
he wanted to keep you alive.

562
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,430
I think he wants to kill you himself.

563
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,230
But a weak woman

564
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,070
like you

565
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,070
doesn't need to trouble him.

566
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,910
Chief Xue.

567
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,560
Looks like you're badly injured too.

568
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,760
If you want to save this woman so badly,

569
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,150
then hurry up and

570
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,210
extend her breath.

571
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,640
If she stops breathing now,

572
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,750
she’ll be dead.

573
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,180
Chief Xue.

574
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,320
What?

575
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,510
You don't dare to be distracted?

576
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,470
You're right.

577
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,430
No survivor of the Asura Field

578
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,670
would simply give his opponent

579
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,870
the chance to strike.

580
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,810
Envoy Miao Feng.

581
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,600
I'll just keep you occupied

582
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,430
so you can watch her

583
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,240
die in front of you.

584
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,350
Chief Xue!

585
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,790
If I go to help her,

586
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,100
both of us

587
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,150
might die

588
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,810
right away.

589
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,330
However...

590
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,080
To think we Eight Elites managed to

591
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,830
put you in such a tight spot.

592
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,550
You're fine?

593
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,930
That was close.

594
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,690
Were you pretending to

595
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,560
faint from your injury?

596
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,790
You had

597
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,040
no defenses at all just now.

598
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,600
Don't tell me...

599
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,080
Were you really planning to risk your life to save me?

600
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,290
Fortunately, I have this.

601
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,690
The Tenacious Needle,

602
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,370
the secret weapon of the Tang Sect in Shu.

603
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,700
Since Tang Que died,

604
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,430
it disappeared from the martial world.

605
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,760
It's actually with you.

606
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,630
Yes.

607
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,870
Someone

608
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,550
mortgaged it for their medical fee.

609
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm fine.

610
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:49,690
Miao Feng!

611
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,510
You've exhausted your inner energy.

612
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,990
You must be treated immediately.

613
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,050
It's not safe here.

614
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,300
-Let’s…
-There's no time.

615
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,630
Chief Xue.

616
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,530
How are you?

617
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,790
The reed pipe.

618
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,830
Why do you have it?

619
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,340
Why did you take such a risk?

620
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:35,950
You said

621
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,630
this reed pipe

622
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,270
was given by your past family.

623
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,090
You must cherish it very much.

624
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,520
That's why you kept it close to you all the time.

625
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,190
If I didn't pick it up,

626
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,340
I'm afraid that in this vast snowfield,

627
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,630
it'd be lost forever.

628
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,740
I also once lost

629
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,020
something important.

630
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,150
Luckily,

631
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,350
it came back

632
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,230
to me.

633
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:07,790
Thank you.

634
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,710
I told you

635
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,550
not to thank me all the time.

636
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,750
Chief Xue.

637
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,790
Chief Xue!

638
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,430
Chief Xue.

639
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,350
Wake up.

640
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:29,920
Chief Xue!

641
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:31,990
Chief Xue!

642
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,080
This feeling...

643
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,190
I've never felt it since I've learned

644
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,870
the Spring Breeze.

645
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,100
What's going on?
