He has been unconscious for a long time.

First, apply acupuncture to his Shixuan point to help revive his consciousness.

Yes.

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,220

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,720
Chief Xue,

20
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,760
has Mo woken up?

21
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,800
He has already woken up.

22
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,990
What exactly is Mo's illness?

23
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,830
He was a premature child,

24
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,890
born with congenital deficiencies.

25
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,390
His body is weak and fragile, unable to sustain itself.

26
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,250
His vital energy is too depleted,

27
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,510
which has caused his Yin energy to be exhausted internally

28
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,280
and his Yang energy to become weak externally.

29
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,750
One could say his condition is critical,

30
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,880
hanging by a thread.

31
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,310
The fact that he made it to this point

32
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,970
is already quite remarkable.

33
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,790
Well...

34
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,070
Chief Xue, do you have a way to treat him?

35
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,320
Of course.

36
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,070
But for the next three days,

37
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,910
neither of you

38
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,740
may set foot in the medicine hut.

39
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,550
Three days?

40
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,750
We can't see Mo

41
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,990
for three whole days?

42
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,430
But ever since he was born,

43
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,590
Mo has never left my side for even a moment.

44
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,270
Besides, he's already awake.

45
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,270
Please understand

46
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,600
my feelings as a mother.

47
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,909
If you want to see him,

48
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,310
it's not impossible.

49
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,650
Thank you, Chief Xue.

50
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,630
Then you can take him

51
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,360
out of the valley and leave now.

52
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,290
That way, you can see him every day.

53
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,430
I...

54
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,070
Chief Xue, since you've

55
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,200
made such a request,

56
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,650
I assume you're confident

57
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,670
that Mo

58
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,990
will recover after three days?

59
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,790
Don't try to test me with your words.

60
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,990
I said three days, so it will be three days.

61
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,810
If you trust me,

62
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,740
wait three days.

63
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,470
If not,

64
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,570
just leave now.

65

66
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,070
since we're already here at the Apothecary Valley,

67
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,530
let's just stay calm and wait for three days.

68
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,710
Chief,

69
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,190
should I arrange for those two

70
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,470
to stay at Longmen Village at the foot of the mountain?

71
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,330
Have them stay in the guest rooms.

72
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,170
According to the rules of our Apothecary Valley,

73
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,870
the patient's family

74
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,470
must all stay at the foot of the mountain.

75
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:44,980
Only the patient

76
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,310
is allowed to stay in the valley.

77
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,530
Chief, why did you make an exception for them?

78
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,950
Could it be because you find Mr. Seven

79
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,909
handsome and charming,

80
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,150
and that's why you...

81
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:52,870
Mr. Seven broke through

82
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,159
our formation earlier, but instead of forcing his way in,

83
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,550
he retreated outside the gate.

84
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,830
I assume Chief respects

85
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,830
his noble conduct,

86
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,030
which is why she made this arrangement.

87

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,630

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,340
Too bad you're the only one moved by your words.

176
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,470
You don't need to worry about me.

177
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,610
Do you need my help?

178
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,870
No.

179
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,770
This Rootless Water

180
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,630
has nothing to do with that child.

181
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,390
Then Mo...

182
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,570
If you want to know about his condition,

183
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,900
just wait two more days.

184
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,930
Even if it has nothing to do with Mo,

185
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,340
I can still help.

186
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,960
Leaving here

187
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,110
would be the best help you could offer.

188
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,850
The white stones have built a solid position

189
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,100
and are now enclosing a large territory.

190
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,220
I can seize the opportunity to invade and kill the live stones,

191
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,350
neutralizing its killing potential.

192
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,630
The sunlight is abundant here,

193
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,060
but there used to be a large boulder blocking the way.

194
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,950
I never expected Chief to be so creative,

195
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,750
turning that boulder

196
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,110
into such a huge chessboard.

197
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,070
Truly fascinating.

198
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,640
Indeed.

199
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,140
When Chief has some free time,

200
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,710
she can come here

201
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,310
to bask in the sun and play Go.

202
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,790
It's quite peaceful.

203
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,820
The black stones already have a true eye.

204
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,080
Someone has been here.

205
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,110
Chief has been playing Go remotely

206
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,140
with this person for several years.

207
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,830
They never arrange to meet.

208
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,150
Whoever remembers

209
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,180
just places a stone.

210
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,170
They've been playing for a long time

211
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,000
but still haven't finished the game.

212
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,140
Not only that,

213
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,810
they've never met each other.

214
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,450
They don't even know if the other person is old or young,

215
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,510
male or female,

216
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,070
or what they look like.

217
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,780
It's quite intriguing.

218
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,850
Maybe that person

219
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,730
is so ugly

220
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,990
that they don't dare to show their face.

221
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,150
Who said that?

222
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,130
What if the other person is handsome and dashing,

223
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,990
a true gentleman?

224
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,750
Impossible.

225
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,990
Why is it impossible?

226
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,270
Though he has secured a path to live,

227
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,110
I still have a way to capture him.

228
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,140
I'll see if he falls for it.

229
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,990
Chief,

230
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,670
you've been playing Go with that person for so long.

231
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,990
Don't you want to know who he is

232
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,250
and what he looks like?

233
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,160
I play Go with him purely for enjoyment.

234
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,350
We come when we feel like it

235
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,660
and leave fully satisfied.

236
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,770
It's all about going with the flow.

237
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:44,720
Exactly.

238
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,950
The Apothecary Valley is not involved with the martial world.

239
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,750
Knowing that person's identity

240
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,950
would only bring unnecessary trouble.

241
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,680
Chief,

242
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,530
something happened at the medicine hut.

243
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,050
It's been three days already.

244
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,480
Why hasn't there been any sign of progress?

245
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,640
Junior Sister,

246
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,610
don't worry too much.

247
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,500
The three days are up.

248
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,450
Mo will surely be fine.

249
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,070
Chief Xue,

250
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,950
it's been three days.

251
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,680
May I

252
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
see Mo now?

253
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,220
Didn't you say that after three days,

254
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,750
I would be allowed to see Mo?

255
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,190
Please wait outside.

256
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,520
After I administered the acupuncture,

257
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,850
he should have woken up.

258
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,290
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

259
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,240
Mo.

260
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,590
Mommy is here.

261
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,110
Mo.

262
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,430
Mo.

263
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,230
Mo...

264
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,590
It was you!

265
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,160
You killed my child!

266
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,260
You promised me

267
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,470
that Mo would recover after three days.

268
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,550
Why is he no longer breathing now?

269
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,630
It was all your fault!

270
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,390
What are you doing?

271
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,480
Don't come over!

272
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,630
You killed him.

273
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,990
Don't come over!

274
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,190
Don't come over!

275
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,760
Be quiet!

276
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,410
Don't touch Mo!

277
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,390
Put down your sword!

278
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,030
Stay still!

279
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,760
Don't you dare touch our Chief!

280
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,310
Step back.

281
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,350
Mo.

282
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,890
I told you to step back!

283
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,410
Three days ago,

284
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,590
Mo had clearly already woken up.

285
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,870
It was you who demanded

286
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,660
that we not step into the medicine hut.

287
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,260
We have followed that order.

288
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,220
But now Mo has stopped breathing.

289
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,160
What exactly did you do to him?

290
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,860
Something must have gone wrong.

291
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,310
What went wrong is that

292
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,590
you collected Rootless Water every morning,

293
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,120
but you had never set foot in the medicine hut.

294
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,630
If that's not negligence, then what is?

295
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,400
One hour.

296
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,150
If I can figure out the cause of his illness

297
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,010
within an hour,

298
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,040
he might still have a slim chance of survival.

299
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,850
But if we miss that window,

300
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,790
then there will truly be no hope for him.

301
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,130
You...

302
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,460
Mo is already like this.

303
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,860
Stop tormenting him.

304
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,230
I won’t let you lay a finger on Mo again.

305
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,800
Don’t be afraid, Mo.

306
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,630
Why?

307
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,150
What exactly went wrong?

308
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,690
Did you give him any water?

309
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,250
Chief, you instructed

310
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,310
that within six hours before acupuncture,

311
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,190
we were not allowed

312
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,830
to give him any food or water—not even a single drop.

313
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,960
Naturally, we wouldn’t dare disobey.

314
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,570
What did you do to him?

315
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,070
Tell me!

316
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,800
Did you do something to him?

317
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,380
I didn’t do anything.

318
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,270
Tell me!

319
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,620
What exactly did you do?

320
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,670
I didn't do anything.

321
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,840
I didn't do anything.

322
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,340
I didn't do anything...

323
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,490
If that's the case,

324
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,400
even bloodletting at acupoints

325
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,530
won't help anymore.

326
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,150
The child's extraordinary meridians

327
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,210
have all withered.

328
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,110
Ordinary treatment methods

329
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,440
wouldn't have worked.

330
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,610
I cut off his food and drink

331
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,550
to make him

332
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,810
reach a state of extreme weakness

333
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,500
and enter the turtle-breathing state.

334
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,750
Then I'd use acupuncture to force out the accumulated toxins in his body

335
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,750
and bring him back from the brink of death.

336
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,910
If he received

337
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,410
even a drop of water at this point,

338
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,070
it would bring some vitality.

339
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,950
He wouldn't be able to fully enter the turtle-breathing state.

340
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,170
Not only would the treatment be ineffective,

341
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,430
it could even kill him.

342
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,190
I was afraid you

343
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,310
would let your concern cloud your judgment.

344
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,150
So I forbade you from

345
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,750
seeing him during the 3 days.

346
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,870
I didn't expect

347
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,000
it would still fail at the last moment.

348
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,770
The ice cave...

349
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,630
Go to the ice cave.

350
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,750
The ice cave is formed by

351
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,870
thousand-year-old unmelting frost.

352
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,990
In that extremely cold place,

353
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,230
he may be able to enter the turtle-breathing state again.

354
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,500
If I perform acupuncture there,

355
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,230
there might be a chance to save him.

356
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,830
Chief, you can't!

357
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,430
You can't!

358
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,670
Quick,

359
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,050
give me the child!

360
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,690
Mo is already in this state.

361
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,240
Please don't torture him anymore.

362
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,020
I won't let him

363
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,750
leave my side even for a moment.

364
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:22,930
Mo, be good.

365
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,400
Mo, don't be afraid.

366
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,630
Mother is here.

367
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,030
If I don't save him today,

368
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,070
at worst, I'll refund the consultation fee

369
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,730
and have some peace and quiet.

370
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,130
If you leave this door,

371
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,130
don't regret it later.

372
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,040
Junior.

373
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,200
Please give Mo to me.

374
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,360
[Apothecary Valley Ice Cave]

375
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,430
Chief,

376
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,890
the ice cave is so cold.

377
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,790
Your cold disease...

378
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,510
Enough talk.

379
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,270
All of you, get out.

380
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,950
-Chief!
-Chief!

381
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,430
Get out!

382
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,350
Mr. Seven.

383
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,950
Junior.

384
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,610
Let's go out first.

385
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,950
The cold in this ice cave penetrates to the bone.

386
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,810
She is worried we can't endure it.

387
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,880
But she has a cold disease.

388
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,850
Xiao Cheng,

389
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,550
go bring the hand warmer.

390
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,440
Bring a fur coat too.

391
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:41,970
Alright.

392
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,510
Shuang Hong.

393
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,750
A person named Xuanyuan Sanguang

394
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,950
is causing trouble at the valley entrance.

395
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,590
Lan Lan just went down the mountain to deliver medicine

396
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,830
and was captured by them.

397
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,460
What?

398
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,510
Xuanyuan Sanguang must have been unhappy

399
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,710
about losing to our Chief a few days ago.

400
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,750
He chose this crucial moment

401
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,230
when the Chief is treating a patient...

402
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,140
You wait here first.

403
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,190
I'll go check it out.

404
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,720
Let's go.

405
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,490
Don't move!

406
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,350
Open the door quickly, Chief Xue!

407
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,360
I have your people in my hands!

408
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,270
Are you really going to be so heartless and ignore this?

409
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,110
That's right, that's right!

410
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,670
Open the door!

411
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,550
Open the door quickly!

412
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,910
If you don't open the door, we'll break in!

413
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,590
Isn't your gambling skill

414
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,590
better than mine,

415
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,650
the Gambling King?

416
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,390
Today,

417
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,070
we'll gamble with

418
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,230
this little girl's life!

419
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,270
That's right!

420
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,510
Shuang Hong.

421
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,270
Please get the Chief quickly!

422
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,590
The Chief is administering acupuncture.

423
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,650
She can't stop now.

424
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,150
But they will really kill

425
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,990
Lan Lan!

426
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,070
If you don't open the door, I'll kill her!

427
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,430
Little girl, scream!

428
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,760
Get your Chief to come out and save you!

429
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,180
Open the door!

430
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,910
Open the door.

431
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,350
Open the door.

432
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,610
Open the door quickly!

433
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,330
Release that young lady.

434
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,910
Where did this pretty boy come from?

435
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,040
You dare stand up

436
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,990
for others with your meager skills?

437
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,250
If you know what's good for you, get lost.

438
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,880
When did

439
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,510
this Apothecary Valley

440
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,910
get another man?

441
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,470
Where did he come from?

442
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,960
He must be

443
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,540
Xue Ziye's kept man.

444
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,350
I was wondering why

445
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,550
Xue Ziye extorted so much money from me.

446
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,560
So it was to keep a man!

447
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,970
Why don't we ask Chief Xue

448
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,570
to spend some money on us too?

449
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,290
Bring out a few more young girls

450
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,650
to drink with us.

451
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,890
That would be even better!

452
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,070
Right, brothers?

453
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,830
That's right!

454
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,870
Our boss

455
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,790
is very handsome too!

456
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,720
Of course!

457
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,830
Looks like

458
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,240
we can't resolve this peacefully.

459
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,500
You've got some nerve.

460
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,420
You think you alone can stop us?

461
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,590
Go.

462
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,150
Teach him a lesson.

463
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,100
Attack!

464
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,510
Attack!

465
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,330
Don't come any closer!

466
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,490
If you come closer, I'll kill her!

467
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,770
Don't move!

468
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,490
Throw away your sword!

469
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,720
You won't throw it?

470
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,320
Are you alright?

471
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,610
You scared me to death!

472
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,810
From now on,

473
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,510
don't let me hear

474
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,720
that you're causing trouble in Apothecary Valley again.

475
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,380
Otherwise,

476
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,750
I, Huo Zhanbai,

477
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,950
will definitely not let you off easily.

478
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,230
Huo... Huo...

479
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,150
Huo Zhanbai?

480
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:12,950
Yes.

481
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,230
You're the seventh disciple of the Sword Sect?

482
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,070
Quick, quick!

483
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,160
Let's go, let's go!

484
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,070
We can't afford to offend him!

485
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,960
Let's go, go!

486
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,520
Are you alright?

487
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,830
It should be nothing serious.

488
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,960
She's just shocked.

489
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,550
Xiao Jing.

490
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,070
Take her back to rest.

491
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,430
Okay.

492
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,750
Mo.

493
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,310
Go ahead and cry.

494
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,389
Mo.

495
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,000
Mo.

496
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,630
Thank you, Chief.

497
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Thank you, Chief.

498
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,550
Mo.

499
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,520
Thank you very much, Chief.

500
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,120
Thank you very much, Chief.

501
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,160
Starting tomorrow,

502
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,760
we'll use the Qingjin Xuanfei decoction.

503
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,630
Feed him for three consecutive days

504
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,030
and observe its effects.

505
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,430
Then we'll decide whether to change the prescription or not.

506
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:26,990
Yes.

507
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,420
Yes.

508
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,340
Thank you so much, Chief Xue.

509
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,560
Your great kindness

510
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,190
will always be remembered by me, Huo.

511
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,650
Now you know to be grateful.

512
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,150
Earlier,

513
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,670
you were so suspicious of the Chief.

514
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,270
The Chief already suffers from cold disease,

515
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,880
and she stayed in that ice cave for so long.

516
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,150
How could she endure that?

517
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,680
Feng Lyu.

518
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,520
I'm fine.

519
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,230
Chief.

520
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,710
-Chief!
-Chief!

521
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,070
Hurry!

522
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,630
Chief!

523
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,950
The Chief's cold disease flareup this time

524
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,750
is extremely dangerous.

525
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,000
It has blocked all the blood pathways in her body.

526
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,940
With her strength alone,

527
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,070
I'm afraid it will be difficult for her to break through.

528
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,710
We must perform blood circulation for the Chief.

529
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,730
Quickly, take the Chief to the Summer Garden.

530
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,150
Alright.

531
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,750
I'll do it.

532
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,600
Lead the way.

533
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,070
Yes.

534
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,970
Xiao Cheng,

535
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,510
please escort Madam Qiushui back to her guest room.

536
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:22,840
Okay.

537
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,000
Madam Qiushui, please.

538
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,010
[Apothecary Valley Hot Spring]

539
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,150
Wasn't Mr. Huo performing blood circulation

540
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,190
for the Chief?

541
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,570
Why does it look like they're fighting?

542
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,540
Chief!

543
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,830
Chief Xue.

544
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,760
I was just performing blood circulation for you.

545
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,700
I was worried your internal energy might be disrupted,

546
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,790
and you might feel unwell.

547
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,430
Do you understand?

548
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,990
Yes.

549
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,610
Then why did you hit me?

550
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,230
Thank you for performing blood circulation

551
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,710
for me.

552
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,220
You transferred your internal energy to me,

553
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,550
and I thanked you for that.

554
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,350
But I hit you

555
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,510
because you deserved it.

556
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,840
It's a separate matter.

557
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,520
They say Chief Xue is promiscuous,

558
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,710
but I didn't expect you to be shy.

559
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,310
A promiscuous person

560
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,080
fancies good-looking people.

561
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,590
Soaking in the lake

562
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,740
with an ugly guy like you

563
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,320
feels like I'm being bitten by a dog.

564
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,120
What bad luck.

565
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,780
I kindly helped you with blood circulation,

566
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,540
and you didn't even say thank you.

567
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,670
You even slapped me!

568
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,430
Fine, you slapped me,

569
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,240
but you even called me ugly!

570
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
You're terrible!

571
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,720
I'm actually quite good-looking.

572
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,670
Chief.

573
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,040
Thanks to that hot spring,

574
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,110
we managed to suppress

575
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,710
your cold disease this time.

576
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,880
Apothecary Valley has hot springs flowing through it,

577
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,710
making it the warmest place

578
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,710
within hundreds of miles of this snowy wilderness.

579
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,910
It's suitable for you

580
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,760
to live and recuperate.

581
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,870
However,

582
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,090
besides the hot spring this time,

583
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,960
we also owe thanks to Mr. Seven.

584
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,350
Chief,

585
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,040
are you still angry with Mr. Seven?

586
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,870
Mr. Seven

587
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,670
must have expended a lot of internal energy

588
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,550
to perform blood circulation for you this time.

589
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,310
I know.

590
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,750
It's just...

591
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,020
That person tends to take a mile when given an inch.

592
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,480
We can't be too nice to him.

593
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,810
So that's why

594
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,200
you slapped him!

595
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,960
But Chief,

596
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,790
your painstaking efforts to save Mo this time

597
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,860
haven't been in vain after all.

598
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,200
I see that Mo's condition

599
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,660
has indeed improved a lot.

600
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,020
Did you notice it?

601
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,910
Mo appears rosy-cheeked on the surface,

602
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,240
but in reality, his breath is shallow and his spirit is weak.

603
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,790
When I took his pulse in the ice cave,

604
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,000
I discovered an additional

605
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,360
extremely yin and soft energy in his body.

606
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,520
This yin and soft energy

607
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,160
is completely incompatible with his symptoms,

608
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,070
which is why it led to

609
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,200
such a dangerous condition this time.

610
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,790
This extremely yin and soft energy

611
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,070
is a unique characteristic

612
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,070
of the Celestial Alp Sect's martial arts.

613
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,270
I suppose Qiushui Yin

614
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
not only fed him without permission

615
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,110
but also fed him breast milk.

616
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,590
In that case,

617
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,390
because of Qiushui Yin's breastfeeding,

618
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,030
Mo's condition

619
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,830
took a sudden turn for the worse.

620
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,620
The invasion of the yin and soft energy

621
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,910
caused the accumulated problems in his body

622
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,040
to be completely unable to dissipate.

623
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,560
Although I used the ice cave to fight poison with poison,

624
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,450
that child

625
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,120
is ultimately in a critical condition.

626
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,470
Is there really no solution at all?

627
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,070
If Madam Qiushui

628
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,350
and Mr. Seven find out,

629
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,810
I don't know how heartbroken they'll be.

630
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,360
A short-term pain is better than a long-term one.
