4
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,630
You're really tough.

5
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,590
Next time there's a chance to beat you up,

6
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,250
let me do it.

7
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,200
I forgot to tell you.

8
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,360
You're not mute like last time.

9
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,870
I just gave you the

10
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,300
Nine Flowers Qi Gathering Pill.

11
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,350
It's a strong and dry medication.

12
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:02,950
You won't be able to

13
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,410
talk normally for a while.

14
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,190
Might as well.

15
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,790
This way, you can't disturb the other patients

16
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,990
with your yelling.

17
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,270
Damn.

18
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,870
Damn.

19
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,830
Damn...

20
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,980
Your injury this time

21
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,460
is worse than before.

22
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,110
It took a lot of effort

23
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
to fill up the holes in your body.

24
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,310
Although the bleeding has stopped for now,

25
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,640
you need to soak in a medicinal bath later.

26
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,980
I'll apply some ointment

27
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,040
on your face first.

28
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,110
You were passed out in the snow for a long while.

29
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,710
Frostbites are inevitable.

30
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,550
Don't be so stubborn.

31
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,710
Sure, it's just frostbites,

32
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,980
but your face is more important than your body.

33
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,550
To be honest,

34
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,190
you only have one Fate-Reversal Token,

35
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,950
but I've been treating you for eight years.

36
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,230
If I hadn't seen some value

37
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,310
in your face,

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,350
I wouldn't have carried you back

39
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,280
again and again.

40
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,209
What's with that look?

41
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,710
Damn woman.

42
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,830
You're so fierce.

43
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,240
I dare you to say that again.

44
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,240
So am I

45
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,720
considered desirable

46
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,670
in your eyes now?

47
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,830
Only barely.

48
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,590
Chief.

49
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,000
The medicinal bath

50
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,780
is ready.

51
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,580
Drink the anesthetic powder first.

52
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,990
It will hurt a little later.

53
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,650
You have to endure it no matter how painful it is.

54
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,890
Are your legs okay?

55
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,720
Can you walk?

56
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:59,909
Lan Lan, Feng Lyu.

57
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,070
Help Mr. Huo with the medicinal bath.

58
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,930
-Yes.
-No need.

59
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,070
I can do it myself.

60
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,670
This isn't your first time

61
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,790
being watched by others.

62
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,550
Don't be shy.

63
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,600
The anesthetic will kick in later.

64
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,430
If you accidentally

65
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,690
fall into the bathtub,

66
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,390
no one will know if you drown.

67
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,190
Go now.

68
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,040
Do you want us

69
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,070
to carry you in?

70
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,360
Chief.

71
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,270
Shuang Hong, Xiao Cheng.

72
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,150
Granny Ning is treating

73
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,870
the patient in the Autumn Garden.

74
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,950
You two go and help.

75
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,870
-Yes.
-Yes.

76
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,630
Chief.

77
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,670
Thank you for your help.

78
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,110
This person was badly injured,

79
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,430
but luckily, it was just external injuries.

80
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,220
There were no serious internal injuries.

81
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,420
It didn't take much effort to treat him.

82
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,810
When Xiao Cheng and the others are done brewing the medicine,

83
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,140
he just needs to take it.

84
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,480
Shuang Hong.

85
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,090
When he wakes up,

86
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,270
light the soothing incense immediately

87
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,390
to calm him down

88
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,690
and prevent him from hurting others.

89
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,310
Also,

90
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,030
tell the people in the valley

91
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,490
not to look him in the eyes.

92
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,870
Yes.

93
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,430
If anything happens to him,

94
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,760
inform me immediately.

95
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,470
By the way,

96
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,390
don't tell Huo Zhanbai

97
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,070
that he's here in the valley.

98
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,429
Okay.

99
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,830
Let me see

100
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,960
if there's still blood stasis.

101
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,750
What now?

102
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,770
You're taking advantage of me

103
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,470
to your heart's content,

104
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,950
but I still have to pay you medical fees.

105
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,750
Chief Xue,

106
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,280
why don’t we count this as paying with my body

107
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,740
and you give me a discount?

108
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,230
You wish.

109
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,830
Are you worth so much?

110
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,590
Why are you so shameless

111
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,190
after coming back this time?

112
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,430
Now that I've collected all the herbs,

113
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,190
I don't have to work so hard anymore.

114
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,650
Naturally, I feel better.

115
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,150
All right.

116
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,500
The wound on the chest

117
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
needs acupuncture.

118
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,230
The wounds on your shoulder and left arm

119
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,270
need time to heal.

120
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,870
Your leg's also injured,

121
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,400
so you shouldn't walk much.

122
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,430
Later,

123
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,550
I'll prescribe some medicine

124
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,030
to replenish your blood and energy.

125
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,330
It will take at least one to two months

126
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,730
for you to fully recover.

127
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,390
One to two months?

128
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,750
Mo’s illness

129
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,950
can’t wait that long.

130
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,750
The last time I went back to see him,

131
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,950
he was much weaker.

132
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,990
Chief Xue.

133
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,620
Since the Dragon Blood Pearl

134
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,590
has been obtained,

135
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,070
we have acquired all five herbs.

136
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,550
When will you

137
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,780
make the medicine?

138
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,910
Actually,

139
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,200
I've always wanted to tell you

140
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,510
that Mo's medicine is...

141
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,510
Just make it according to your plan.

142
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,430
No matter what the effect is,

143
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,670
we have to try our best.

144
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,720
Focus on your recovery.

145
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
Don't worry about

146
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,450
the medicine concoction.

147
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,830
Thank you.

148
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,250
For eight years,

149
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,500
he has risked his life.

150
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,790
Mo’s illness

151
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,790
is incurable.

152
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,370
If I fail to concoct the medicine,

153
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,870
will you hate me?

154
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
If you know the truth one day,

155
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,770
how should I face you?

156
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,950
Keep quiet.

157
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,390
Or I'll kill you.

158
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,550
Where am I?

159
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,370
Xiao Cheng.

160
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,110
Is he still unconscious?

161
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,730
What are you doing?

162
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,390
Let her go.

163
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,150
You haven't answered

164
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,830
my question just now.

165
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,110
This is the Apothecary Valley.

166
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,910
Our chief saved you out of kindness

167
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,910
to heal you.

168
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,040
The Apothecary Valley?

169
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,440
Did she

170
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,630
save Huo Zhanbai?

171
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,150
Take me to her.

172
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,310
Do you have a conscience?

173
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,750
Our chief kindly

174
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,200
took you back for treatment

175
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,110
and now you're killing people the moment you wake up?

176
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,440
I said take me to see her!

177
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,770
I'll say it again.

178
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,070
Take me to her.

179
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:46,930
Xiao Cheng!

180
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,590
Let her go.

181
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,390
Move.

182
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,070
He wants to see Chief.

183
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:53,870
No.

184
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,780
What if he harms Chief?

185
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,620
I said move!

186
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,270
Or I’ll kill her.

187
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,430
Take me to your chief.

188
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,760
Shuang Hong.

189
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,720
What's going on?

190
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,890
Why does she feel familiar

191
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,680
at a glance?

192
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,030
Chief.

193
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,540
Hand over the Dragon Blood Pearl

194
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,670
or I'll kill her.

195
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,470
As a patient, you should stay in bed.

196
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,350
Let her go.

197
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,520
What's going on?

198
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,670
Why does her voice sound

199
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,510
so familiar?

200
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,220
Don't take Ming Jie's eyes!

201
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,750
He's not a bad guy, Grandpa!

202
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,670
Where have I heard it before?

203
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,800
You haven't recovered yet.

204
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,030
You should rest.

205
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,110
Chief.

206
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,770
What’s wrong with him? He just...

207
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,630
Carry him in.

208
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:23,590
Yes.

209
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,170
You're already in this state,

210
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,590
but you still have

211
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,790
such a strong counterattack instinct.

212
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,150
What kind of

213
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,010
cruel training did you go through

214
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,350
to cultivate

215
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,510
a habit of killing anyone who

216
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,860
comes close

217
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,510
even if you're unconscious?

218
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,230
Get lost!

219
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,030
Get lost.

220
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,110
Let me out.

221
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,990
Let me out!

222
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,319
That blue light just now...

223
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,670
Ming Jie?

224
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,160
Is he really Ming Jie?

225
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,140
Ming Jie.

226
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,589
Is it really you?

227
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,400
All these years,

228
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
you must have not slept well.

229
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,500
The soothing incense

230
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,560
can ease your pain.

231
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,710
Have a good sleep.

232
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,430
Why didn't you kill me?

233
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,080
Doctors don't kill people.

234
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,880
I know you are

235
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,350
a miracle physician in the Apothecary Valley.

236
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,680
But I don't have the Fate-Reversal Token.

237
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,490
Why did you save me?

238
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,790
I also know that

239
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,870
you are the assassin of Yuan Yi Palace.

240
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,800
I've seen your Lixue Sword.

241
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,670
Maybe

242
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,830
you can't recognize my face,

243
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,950
but my eyes...

244
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,840
You can recognize them, right?

245
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,470
Your eyes...

246
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,810
I think I've seen them somewhere before.

247
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,110
Who are you?

248
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,920
Don't you remember?

249
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,310
But I can recognize your eyes.

250
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,640
Don't worry.

251
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,630
I will cure you.

252
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,590
I won't let you be caged

253
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,930
in the dark forever again.

254
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,400
What do you want?

255
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,810
I don't understand

256
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,870
what you're saying.

257
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,630
Give me the Dragon Blood Pearl.

258
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,750
Xuehuai,

259
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,270
you know what?

260
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,270
I met Ming Jie.

261
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,390
He's alive.

262
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,750
You must be happy.

263
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,510
You must miss him too.

264
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,430
He still remembers my eyes.

265
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,390
And his eyes...

266
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,030
I'll never forget them either.

267
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,670
But

268
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,500
I don't know what happened to him.

269
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,750
He has somehow...

270
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,360
Completely forgotten the past.

271
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,390
But it's okay.

272
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,190
Don't worry.

273
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,510
I will do my best to cure him

274
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,290
so that he can regain his memory as soon as possible.

275
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,670
I won't let him

276
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,030
be hurt anymore.

277
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,770
When he recovers,

278
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,860
I'll bring him to see you.

279
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,550
Why hasn't my leg recovered?

280
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,550
How come no one

281
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,880
has come to see me today?

282
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,950
Logically, today's patients

283
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,010
should have all been tended to by now.

284
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,040
But there's no one here.

285
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,720
What are they busy with?

286
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,390
Hello?

287
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,870
I'm thirsty!

288
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,750
I'm here!

289
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,950
I'm here.

290
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,990
Mr. Huo.

291
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,790
I'm here, Mr. Seven.

292
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,690
Are you hungry?

293
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,390
Your leg hasn’t recovered.

294
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,830
Chief has specifically instructed that

295
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,230
you should remain in bed.

296
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,330
If you walk around,

297
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,590
Chief will lecture me.

298
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,390
Please help me

299
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,050
tell on me in front of her.

300
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,000
I want to talk to her too.

301
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,510
Mr. Huo,

302
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,630
aren’t you afraid that she’ll be angry?

303
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,230
Why would I be afraid of that?

304
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,350
What has she been busy with these days?

305
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,270
In the past,

306
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
she would visit several times a day.

307
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Why has she been missing these days?

308
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,040
You won't tell me?

309
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
I'll find her myself.

310
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,750
Mr. Huo!

311
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,580
Mr. Huo.

312
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,550
Actually,

313
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,590
the valley has a new patient recently.

314
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,110
Chief is tending to them.

315
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,510
A new patient?

316
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,190
Was the Fate-Reversal Token issued again?

317
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,920
Who knows

318
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,290
how this person got the token

319
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,890
and arrived here so quickly?

320
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,990
Mr. Huo, please eat your meal.

321
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,190
I have medicine on the stove.

322
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,590
I need to keep an eye on it.

323
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,680
I'll get you some water too.

324
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,510
That's not right.

325
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,710
Why is she going out to get water?

326
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,750
Ming Jie.

327
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,070
I'm sorry.

328
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,950
In order to recover the memories

329
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,550
in your deep consciousness,

330
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,790
I can only use

331
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,590
mind-reading technique on you.

332
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,810
Can you hear me?

333
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,270
What's your name?

334
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,590
I'm Eye.

335
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,110
No, I'm not Eye.

336
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,270
I am...

337
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,350
I am...

338
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,740
Is your name Ming Jie?

339
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,650
Ming Jie?

340
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,740
Yes.

341
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,870
Ming Jie.

342
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,990
No.

343
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,910
I'm not Ming Jie.

344
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,500
I'm not Ming Jie. I'm...

345
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,590
Ming Jie.

346
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,900
Where are you from?

347
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,770
From where?

348
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,590
I...

349
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,230
No.

350
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,670
I didn't come from there.

351
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,390
I tried my best

352
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,590
to escape from there.

353
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,990
Where?

354
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,470
From where?

355
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,030
Go away!

356
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,750
Go away!

357
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,580
Don't come near me!

358
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,240
Don't you dare take my eyes!

359
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,020
Let me out! Let me out!

360
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,650
The mind-reading technique is very gentle.

361
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,920
It won't hurt your body.

362
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,970
Why is this happening?

363
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,940
Why is there a golden needle

364
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,700
in the Yuzheng acupoint?

365
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,070
Fengchi, Baihui...

366
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,910
They used golden needles to seal his mind!

367
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,150
So you don't remember

368
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,350
what happened before

369
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,210
because someone sealed your memories.

370
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,540
It's easy to remove the needles from

371
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,540
the Yuzheng and Fengchi acupoints.

372
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,510
But the Baihui acupoint

373
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,910
is the most important acupoint among

374
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,640
the San and Wu acupoint groups.

375
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,340
He will die if I act rashly.

376
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,090
This woman...

377
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,270
She locked me up in the room all day

378
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,330
and didn't show up.

379
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,680
If she doesn't show up soon,

380
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,430
I'll tear this house down sooner or later

381
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,690
and see what she can do.

382
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,950
Mr. Huo, you have such a temper.

383
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,040
What finally brought you here?

384
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,920
What, missing some needles in your flesh?

385
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:15,750
No.

386
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,120
Where have you been these days?

387
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,350
Didn't you promise to give me acupuncture?

388
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,680
If you didn't show up...

389
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,510
If you didn't show up any longer,

390
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,040
my wound would have healed.

391
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,550
Your wound

392
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,010
has recovered quite well.

393
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,270
In a few days,

394
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,870
you'll completely recover.

395
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,530
You're reaching your 30s,

396
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,070
but you're always getting severely hurt.

397
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,530
Are you really as powerful as they say

398
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,990
in the martial arts world?

399
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,070
You know how good my

400
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,430
martial arts are.

401
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,510
I think you're the best

402
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,440
at getting beaten and taking hits.

403
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,260
Stop acting tough.

404
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,070
Your body

405
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,330
has reached its limit.

406
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,110
If you want to save someone,

407
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,970
you have to think about yourself.

408
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,770
Whether it's trauma or heart disease,

409
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,710
I can't help you forever.

410
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,070
What do you mean?

411
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,670
Nothing.

412
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,050
Once you get the antidote,

413
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,950
you don't have to come

414
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,080
to be scolded again.

415
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,630
You can't afford

416
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,400
such an expensive medical fee.

417
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,350
So,

418
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,780
be careful in the future.

419
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,990
Why won't I come back?

420
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,670
Haven't I paid with my body already?

421
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,000
Let's celebrate

422
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,600
after I recover.

423
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,080
How about a drink together?

424
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,910
Ming Jie.

425
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,940
The first golden needle has been removed.

426
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,070
Have you

427
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,660
remembered some of the past?

428
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,050
Ming Jie.

429
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,070
Why on earth

430
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,790
are you so against

431
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,050
your past memories?

432
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,480
All these years,

433
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,470
you must have been tired.

434
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Have a good sleep.

435
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,050
Chief Xue, you don't seem to be

436
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,010
drinking to celebrate something today.

437
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,680
Rather, you're drinking to drown your sorrows.

438
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,030
I'm drinking all the same, aren't I?

439
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,290
There's a difference.

440
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,910
If you're drinking to celebrate something,

441
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,310
no matter how cheap the wine is,

442
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,950
it will taste sweet like honey.

443
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,830
But if you're drinking to drown your sorrows,

444
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,190
even the most expensive wine

445
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,720
will taste bitter and foul.

446
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,570
You've just recovered

447
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,010
and you're busy again.

448
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,230
If something is really

449
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,090
bothering you,

450
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,110
please let me know.

451
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,680
It's so beautiful here under the plum blossoms.

452
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,840
What a waste of nice things.

453
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,310
Are you trying to tell me

454
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,710
that

455
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,720
you're really amazing?

456
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,030
I am.

457
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,030
If I tell you,

458
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,070
can you resolve it for me?

459
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,170
Of course.

460
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,630
I still owe you a wish.

461
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,990
Then you should pay back what you owe

462
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,650
the Apothecary Valley first.

463
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,930
L- Let's pick another wish first.

464
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,570
Give me the Snow Harrier.

465
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,340
It looks valuable.

466
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,460
Another wish.

467
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,840
You're bargaining.

468
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,870
How insincere.

469
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,310
Rather, you're purposely demanding

470
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,370
things I cannot do.

471
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,750
But I sincerely want to

472
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,950
do something for you.

473
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,100
Tell me.

474
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,909
How sincere are you?

475
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,190
Although the Apothecary Valley is not involved with the martial world,

476
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,389
you still handle people

477
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,719
from the martial world.

478
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,389
There have been many dangers in the valley lately.

479
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,750
The attendants in the valley

480
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,949
are weak in martial arts.

481
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,880
You need someone

482
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,489
who can safeguard the place.

483
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,179
I’ll take care of the valley's safety

484
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,040
in the future.

485
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,469
Also,

486
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,650
tedious work like

487
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,510
chopping wood, moving medicines, and repairing houses,

488
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,510
can all be handed

489
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,989
to me instead.

490
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,030
He has made good plans

491
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,000
for the future.

492
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,750
But when he knows the truth of the prescription,

493
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,280
would he still be like this?

494
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,730
Even if he doesn't blame me,

495
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,750
how can I live up to my conscience?

496
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,060
Why aren't you saying anything?

497
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,440
You're even laughing!

498
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,640
Why are you laughing?

499
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,590
I'm serious.

500
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,390
I see now.

501
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,800
You plan to live in the

502
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,550
Apothecary Valley for free.

503
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,870
What a joke.

504
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,670
I'm the best swordsman in the Central Plains.

505
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,510
I'm giving up being the chief

506
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,710
of the Sword Sect to be

507
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,730
a handyman at your valley,

508
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,460
and you're not happy with that?

509
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,830
Why is your cup empty?

510
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,470
You...

511
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,150
Actually,

512
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,900
I've always had a feeling.

513
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,800
For eight years,

514
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,030
I traveled around,

515
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,750
often waking up

516
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,010
in unfamiliar places.

517
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,130
Here and there, I would suddenly feel

518
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,670
like I didn't know where I was

519
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,760
or where I should go.

520
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,640
I would look up at the starry sky

521
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,990
and realize that apart from the moon and the stars,

522
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,990
I was alone on the

523
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,590
vast land.

524
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,230
All around me, it was so cold and silent,

525
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,000
it terrified me.

526
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,910
But now...

527
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,020
What about now?

528
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,640
Now, I have warm wine,

529
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,430
flowers,

530
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:32,810
snow,

531
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,830
and you.

532
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,910
It's enough.

533
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,430
♫A cup of wine, a toast to the world, as wind and snow knock on the door♫

534
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,540
♫Sigh for love and hate, leaving no trace upon the palm♫

535

♫Life drifts like dust, when will we meet again?♫

536
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,230
Will you regret it?

537
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,040
Regret what?

538
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,930
♫From vibrant warmth to icy cold, it's just a single turn away♫

539
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,910
You traveled extensively

540
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,310
and even risked your life

541
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,590
to find a cure for Mo.

542
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:41,150
♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

543
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
As the guardian of Mo's hope,

544

♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

545
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,200

♫With pure and earnest hearts, how many lovers remain?♫

♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

You've been waiting

550
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,100
and hoping that Xuehuai

551
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,310
would wake up one day.

552
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,390
Have you ever regretted it?

-Seven Horses.
-Eight Horses.

567

Eight horses, not seven.
