166
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,050
Greetings, Chief.

167
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,610
You've changed.

168
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,540
You've really changed.

169
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,490
You look to be in good spirits.

170
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,840
You haven't changed at all.

171
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,830
Me?

172
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,940
I'm old.

173
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,430
When the Seven Swords besieged Yuan Yi Palace,

174
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,830
I wanted to join,

175
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,710
but I was too weak to.

176
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,350
I didn't expect such a weak

177
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,400
and sickly

178
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,870
woman like Chief Xue

179
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,030
to successfully

180
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,870
break into the tiger's den alone

181
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,350
to kill Chang Wujue.

182
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,670
You've heard of everything?

183
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,670
Come.

184
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,100
Sit down.

185
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,610
Chonghua's infiltration

186
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,680
of Yuan Yi Palace as a spy

187
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,950
was top secret.

188
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,190
No one else knew

189
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,240
except me.

190
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,990
If I hadn't decided

191
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,740
to send him as an undercover,

192
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,110
both of you would

193
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,950
still be high-spirited brothers

194
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,590
standing united against the same enemy.

195
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,870
Things came to this because of me.

196
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,030
It's all my fault.

197
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,690
Things aren't always black or white.

198
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,110
You had to make a quick decision.

199
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,210
You couldn't have expected

200
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,250
this outcome.

201
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,470
What about you?

202
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,920
Do you blame me

203
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,910
for not telling you

204
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,340
the truth back then?

205
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,830
Chief.

206
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,390
It's all in the past.

207
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,890
I've let it go.

208
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,670
Whether you'd

209
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,000
told me the truth or not,

210
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,640
without Sixth Brother around,

211
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,830
I'd still take good care of

212
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,890
his wife and child.

213
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,610
It's good that you've let it go.

214
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,820
With Chang Wujue dead

215
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,610
and the Five Sages destroyed,

216
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,980
Yuan Yi Palace has suffered a huge blow.

217
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
It won't be easy for them

218
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,070
to make a comeback.

219
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,310
The Central Plains

220
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,060
will be in peace for

221
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,510
at least a few good years.

222
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,530
It's time for an old man like me

223
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,510
to give way to the more capable.

224
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,440
I summoned you back

225
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,190
because of this.

226

227

228
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,830
the same as that eight years ago.

229
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,470

230
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:51,920
Thank you

231
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,250
for your years of recognition

232
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,250
and cultivation.

233
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,880
In the past eight years,

234
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,710
I've gained some insights about

235
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,350
the martial world

236
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,160
and about responsibility.

237
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,990
Like you said,

238
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,790
a sickly woman

239
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,910
like Chief Xue

240
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,550
breaking into the tiger's den alone

241
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,720
to confront Chang Wujue

242
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,650
was such a brave and righteous act.

243
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,630
As a brawny man,

244
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,400
safeguarding world peace

245
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
and preventing tragedies

246
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
like the Mo Family Village massacre

247
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
is the meaning of my life from now on.

248
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,550
So,

249
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,350
rather than becoming chief,

250
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,310
I'd prefer to be in the martial world

251
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,830
to punish evil and promote good.

252
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,630
I'll never regret it.

253
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,030
In the future,

254
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,830
if Sword Sect's new chief

255
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,870
needs my help,

256
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,400
I'll give my all to help.

257
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,350
Fine.

258
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,230
Since you've made up your mind,

259
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,470
I won't force you

260
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,010
to be chief.

261
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,390
But remember,

262
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,950
no matter where you go in the future,

263
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,270
as long as

264
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,240
you do what you want,

265

00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,270
from the devil's cave.

341
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,550
Eye.

342
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:52,230
♫The brush stops, leaving a lone person leaning against a plum tree♫

343
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:02,210
♫I have a pot of new wine and a warm stove♫

344
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:09,220
♫When the sky is about to snow, I can have a drink♫

345
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:16,230
♫My hesitations left too many regrets♫

346
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,770
♫Will you spend your time with me?♫

347
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,550
♫Several times my sleeve brushed by, wanting to pause my hand♫

348
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:44,450
♫Feelings are hard to describe, yet they long to pierce my heart and soul♫

349
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,020
♫I gaze at the mountains and rivers, seeking a place to return♫

350
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:58,630
♫Yet my true home lies in the deepest part of your gaze♫

351
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,880
Sister Ye!

352
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:08,080
♫I have a pot of new wine and a warm stove♫

353
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,030
I'm here to see you.

354
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:15,040
♫When the sky is about to snow, I can have a drink♫

355
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:22,450
♫My hesitations left too many regrets♫

356
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,450
♫Will you spend your time with me?♫

357
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,810
Can I have a drink too?

358
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,660
Actually...

359
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,450
I could tell that she liked you very much.

360
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
It's all my fault.

361
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,530
Because she wanted to save me,

362
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,140
you couldn't be with her.

363
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,670
She'd have saved you either way.

364
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,739
A pot of new wine with green film

365
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,110
and a warm red-clay stove.

366
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,760
When it's about to snow in the evening,

367
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:50,630
can we have a drink?

368
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,790
The song's completed tonight,

369
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,610
and the people's dispersed.

370
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,590
Ziye.

371
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,080
Sister Ye.

372
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,550
Chief Xue.

373
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,910
Sister Ye.

374
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,390
I'm renouncing the world from now on.

375
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,800
I wonder if it will

376
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,190
wash away my sins.

377
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,430
I hope it's not too late.

378
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,710
Over the past decades,

379
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,960
I've been drinking with you every year.

380
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,710
Now I can drink

381
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,210
as well as you.

382
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,830
Come on.

383
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,500
As usual.

384
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,750
Three!

385
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,110
Five!

386
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,580
Six!

387
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,230
You lost!

388
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:32,600
♫A branch moves, dancing with the wind♫

389
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,560
Let me drink for you.

390
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,640
♫The moonlight shines thousands of miles to fill the wilderness♫

391
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:46,430
♫I've traveled all over the world to capture it in a poem♫

392
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,580
Come on.

393
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,470
Again!

394
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:53,520
♫The brush stops, leaving a lone person leaning against a plum tree♫

395
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,100
Three!

396
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,710
Eight!

397
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,230
Six!

398
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:03,500
♫I have a pot of new wine and a warm stove♫

399
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,640
I'll drink. I'll drink.

400
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:10,510
♫When the sky is about to snow, I can have a drink♫

401
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:17,520
♫My hesitations left too many regrets♫

402
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,170
In the past,

403
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,880
I could never beat you.

404
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,350
♫Will you spend your time with me?♫

405
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,270
Now,

406
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,510
you can't beat me.

407
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,900
♫Several times my sleeve brushed by, wanting to pause my hand♫

408
