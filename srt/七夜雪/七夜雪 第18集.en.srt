00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,830
Xiao Cheng, Lan Lan,

5
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,870
hurry up.

6
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,390
Chief is coming back soon.

7
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,630
Warm up the bed

8
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,470
and close the windows.

9
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,470
-Okay.
-Let's go.

10
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,680
It's broken.

11
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,180
This is Chief's most treasured thing.

12
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,710
She's coming back any minute.

13
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,790
What should I do?

14
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,870
I didn't mean it.

15
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,030
I really didn't mean it.

16
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,420
Alright, alright. It's fine.

17
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,720
I'll tell Chief when she gets back,

18
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,160
okay?

19
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,890
What happened?

20
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,830
-Chief!
-Chief!

21
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,830
Chief.

22
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,870
Chief.

23
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,350
Chief...

24
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,110
I didn't mean it.

25
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,910
I really didn't mean it.

26
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,590
Chief...

27
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Chief, please punish me.

28
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,590
It's fine.

29
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,910
Chief.

30
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,350
Go after Chief.

31
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,550
What if she does something

32
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,300
out of sadness?

33
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,070
Okay.

34
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,070
Maybe

35
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,470
it's time for Chief

36
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,790
to move on.

37
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,670
Ziye.

38

Granny.

39
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,990
Shuang Hong

40
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,710
told me about the dead branches.

41
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,250
Watering a rootless plant with Rootless Water.

42
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,880
Master really

43
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,510
played a big joke on me.

44
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,710
Chief Liao had always hoped you

45
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,360
would awaken your inner voice on your own.

46
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,550
She wasn't trying to save Mr. Xuehuai,

47
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,830
but you, who were young

48
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,490
yet had a heart as barren as a dead tree.

49
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,440
The heart of a healer

50
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,550
is the heart of healing.

51
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,430
You were the one who gave that prescription to Mr. Huo.

52
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,690
You should understand

53
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,250
that you can't stop flowers from withering,

54
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,360
just like you can't stop people from facing their fate.

55
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,510
Instead of maintaining Xuehuai's

56
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,750
illusory life,

57
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,620
it's better to keep

58
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,240
the beautiful memories we once shared in mind.

59
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,880
That is the only eternal

60
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,670
and unchanging thing between us.

61
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,950
Master had a good intention.

62
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,410
It was my fault for being stubborn

63
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,130
and not realizing it until now.

64
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,590
Perhaps,

65
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,530
it's not just about Mr. Xuehuai.

66
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,790
This time, to uncover the truth,

67
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,850
Seven almost lost his life.

68
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,670
At that time, he lost too much blood.

69
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,909
I had no choice but to take the Heat Pill,

70
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,840
barely suppressing the coldness,

71
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,350
and that's how I pulled him back

72
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,680
from the brink of death.

73
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,200
I can't let anyone

74
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,030
risk their lives for me anymore.

75
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,070
Over these years,

76
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,150
I've been persuading you

77
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,909
to let go of the past.

78
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,430
Now,

79
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
it seems I can finally rest assured.

80
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,110
Ziye,

81
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,610
I'm happy for you.

82
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,930
At this moment,

83
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,590
if we could swap tea for wine,

84
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,320
it might be more enjoyable.

85
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,909
The cliffs are dangerous.

86
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,750
Don't die.

87
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,120
You haven't paid off your debt yet.

88
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,740
Here.

89
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,000
After finishing this last cup of wine,

90
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,280
I'll be leaving.

91
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,280
It's the last medicinal ingredient.

92
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,110
Yes.

93
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,610
It's already the last one.

94
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,890
I don't know if I can

95
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,860
successfully obtain the Dragon Blood Pearl this time.

96
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,120
It might take a long time before I return.

97
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,450
Take care of yourself.

98
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,390
In this valley,

99
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,750
I have the Snow Hail Formation protecting me,

100
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,820
so I'll be safe.

101
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,120
Then, after I return,

102
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,950
you can tell me

103
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,450
what you want most.

104
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,630
After all, I need to repay

105
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,600
the favors I owe you.

106
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,070
You should care more

107
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,000
about yourself.

108
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,650
The Dragon Blood Pearl

109
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,510
is a treasure

110
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,640
that many people will be fighting for.

111
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,190
Use the old soil to grow a new bud.

112
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,890
Plant it by the window.

113
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,560
Watering the new bud

114
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,110
will be like starting a new life.

You came

134
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,570
at a bad time today.

135

My wife and the others

have already gone to bed.

With my cooking skills,

138
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,570
I could only heat up some

139
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,150
ready-made lamb for you to taste.

140
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,840
Brother Meng, you're too polite.

141
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,680
It's already quite rare to have a hot meal

142
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,110
when you're away from home.

143
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,110
Come. Sit down.

144
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,090
Let's have a drink.

and the others are asleep,

147
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,750
let's drink until we're totally drunk.

148

Here.

149
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:11,990
Here.

150
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,110
Good wine.

151
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,350
It has been so many years,

152
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,630
but today,

153
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,030
it feels just like

154
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,870
the first time

155
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,170
we drank together.

156
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,870
Yes.

157
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,940
Every time I came here,

158
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,870
I was in a hurry coming and leaving.

159
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,630
Now that I think about it,

160
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,870
time really flies.

I'm a few years older than you.

164
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,610
There's something

165
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm not sure if I should say.

166
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,730
Brother Meng, feel free to say it.

167
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,430
You've been

168
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,000
running around

169
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,150
and worn out.

170
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,540
Even though you never said it,

171
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,070
I could tell

172
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,150
that when you were looking at Tai and Chu,

173
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,750
this young couple, there was

174
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,900
a desire to settle down in your eyes.

175
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,710
So I want to advise you

176
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,960
to think about yourself

177
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,370
and consider settling down.

178
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,950
It's coming soon.

179
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,750
Really?

180
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,790
So this time, will all this running around

181
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,150
come to an end?

182
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,750
I hope for a good outcome.

183
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,140
Great.

184
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm happy for you.

185
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,390
The assessment for the Five Sages this year

186
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,490
can begin now.

187
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,430
The Five Sages have assessments every year,

188
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,350
with the last place being eliminated.

189
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,350
The assessments are always in the summer.

190
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,810
Is it a bit early this year?

191
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,930
Ever since the assassination attempt on Nangong Yanqi failed,

192
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,590
everyone has been unsettled.

193
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
It's time to keep them on their toes.

194
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,490
Doctrine Leader,

195
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,869
did you notice anything unusual?

196
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,349
The fact that there's nothing unusual

197
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,589
is the most unusual.

198
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,390
Your martial arts are the best among the Five Sages.

199
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,250
During the assessments each year,

200
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,310
you're just playing along with them.

201
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,869
As for the other four,

202
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,550
Miao Shui seems gentle and soft,

203
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,520
but she's incredibly cruel;

204
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,160
Ming Li has mediocre martial arts,

205
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,640
yet he is cunning

206
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,470
and loves to attack when least expected.

207
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,670
As for Miao Huo and Miao Kong,

208
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,800
one is reckless and the other is rigid.

209
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,470
It seems that this year,

210
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,230
one of these two will be eliminated.

211
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,200
I've long grown tired of

212
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,380
these faces.

213
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,030
It's time

214
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,160
to see some new ones.

215
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,080
I got it.

216
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,060
The last one to return

217
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,750
will be replaced.

218
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,830
Go.

219
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,690
Are you crying?

220
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,740
What is your task?

To go to Yunxie Mountain

222
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,410
and take the head of Master White-Brows.

223
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,970
Master White-Brows?

224
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,710
He lives on the ice mountain all year long.

225
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,920
His Ice Palm

226

227
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,440
break your Kylin skills in an instant.

228
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,190
You have no chance of winning.

229
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,120
You might as well just die now.

230
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,230
Bah!

231
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,450
I don't believe

232
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,510
I can't defeat him.

233
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,370
Why don't we...

234
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,310
switch?

just stop talking.

Aren't you leaving?

247
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm not leaving.

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,750
They are buns.

347
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,470
Candied haws!

348
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,750
Fireworks.

349
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,150
Look.

350
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,750
Let's go over there and take a look, okay?

351
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,070
Okay.

352
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,800
What is that?

353
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,350
Great!

354
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,310
It's smoking!

355
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,890
Mo is rarely this happy.

356
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,270
Uncle, I want a grasshopper.

357
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,920
You want grasshoppers?

358
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,520
Alright.

359
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,870
I'll take you to buy one.

360
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,350
Okay.

361
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,070
Let's go.

362
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,600
Let's go.

363
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,470
Butterflies made of straw!

364
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,830
Grasshoppers made of straw!

365
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,510
Take a look.

366
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,430
Take a look at grasshoppers made of straw.

367
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,630
Which one do you like?

368
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,670
Well...

369
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,910
The parents are kind,

370
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,830
the husband and wife love each other,

371
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,110
and the child is adorable.

372
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,510
What a happy family.

373
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,880
I have plenty of little trinkets here,

374
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,550
so feel free to bring the child over anytime

375
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,350
to have a look.

376
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,830
You've misunderstood.

377
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,110
We're not a family.

378
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,550
I'm his uncle.

379
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,550
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,190
It's okay.

381
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,670
Senior, don't mind it.

382
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,390
I'm a single mom with a kid.

383
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,110
You've been taking care of us alone,

384
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,790
so it's inevitable that others may misunderstand.

385
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,850
It doesn't matter.

386
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,030
Mo,

387
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,190
which one do you like?

388
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,230
I'll buy it for you.

389
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,790
After that,

390
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,580
let's head back, alright?
Alright.

391
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,910
Okay. This one.

392
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,030
Senior,

393
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,020
I heard a traveling doctor has come to town recently.

394
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,990
Later, I want to take Mo

395
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,590
to see him.

396
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,430
Junior.

397
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,960
It is said that her medical skills are excellent.

398
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,280
We'll take this one.

399
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,910
The patterns of orchid and Lingzhi

400
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,040
on this jade pendant

401
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,230
are exactly the same as those on the Fate-Reversal Token.

402
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,760
Could she also be from the Apothecary Valley?

403
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,300
[Liao Qingran, the previous Chief of the Apothecary Valley]

404
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,350
This illness must have lasted

405
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,070
at least five years, hasn't it?

406
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,870
You can diagnose

407
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,800
Mo's condition?

408
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,680
It's been five years and three months.

409
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,390
The doctor who's been treating this child

410
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,920
has decent medical skills.

411
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,030
However...

412
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,800
He'll recover soon.

413
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,190
It'll be soon.

414
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,230
It'll be soon.

415
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,790
At the onset of Mo's illness,

416
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,410
he received a diagnosis from a skilled doctor,

417
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,740
who prescribed a remedy

418
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,560
claiming it could cure him.

419
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,890
Sir, could you please tell me

420
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,730
what ingredients

421
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,910
are in the prescription?

422
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,590
The Seven-Leaf Fungus from the Moon Sect,

423
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,840
the Azure Phoenix Flower from the White Cloud Palace,

424
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,480
the Dragon's Tongue from Mount Jun in Dongting,

425
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,990
the Snow Poppy from Qingling Snow Mountain,

426
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,990
and the Millennial Crimson Cold Dragon Blood Pearl.

427
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,550
Doctor,

428
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,150
what do you think of this prescription?

429
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,110
These ingredients

430
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,210
are all extremely rare

431
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,810
and exceptional medicines.

432
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,310
If you can gather them,

433
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,360
they will indeed be effective.

434
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,470
However, I must

435
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,670
give you some advice.

436
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,390
Spending quality time with him

437
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,940
and taking good care of him,

438
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,270
allowing him to feel happy and at ease,

439
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,610
will be enough.

440
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,450
Thank you, Doctor.

441
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,800
May I ask one more question?

442
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,710
Do you know a famous doctor

443
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,970
with the surname Liao?

444
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:43,990
No.

445
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,310
Sorry for bothering you.

446
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,850
Thank you, Doctor.

447
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,360
Go ahead.

448
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,150
Junior.

449
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,750
You should stop

450
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,610
looking for doctors everywhere.

451
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,060
Normally,

452
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,540
just make sure Mo takes the medicine

453
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,470
that Chief Xue prescribed on time.

454
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,630
There's only

455
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,030
one ingredient missing.

456
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Mo's illness will definitely be cured.

457
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,230
Okay.

458
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:18,920
Let's go.

459
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,960
Let's go.

460
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,990
Let's go home.

461
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,920
Uncle, didn't you say

462
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,870
you would teach me swordsmanship?

463
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,310
I want to learn.

464
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,980
Senior, you have no idea.

465
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,250
When you weren't around,

466
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:38,990
Mo kept asking

467
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,910
when you would come.

468
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,240
He wants to learn swordsmanship from you.

469
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,230
Once you're stronger,

470
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,550
I'll teach you, okay?

471
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,830
No, I want to learn right now!

472
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,390
Mo.

473
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,590
Mo.

474
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,570
Be good.

475
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,230
Mo.

476
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,190
Stop it.

477
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,480
It's time to eat.

478
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,400
Senior,

479
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,630
I made your favorite dish,

480
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,490
stewed mutton.

481
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,950
I won't stay.

482
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,740
I need to rush back to Yangzhou

483
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,660
to look for the Dragon Blood Pearl.

484
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,790
Is the Dragon Blood Pearl in Yangzhou?

485
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,540
Its whereabouts are unknown for now.

486
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,950
I'll go to Yangzhou to gather some information.

487
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,710
There are many merchants

488
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,030
and martial artists there.

489
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,890
Perhaps there will be some clues.

490
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,510
The meal is ready.

491
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,350
Why not eat before you go?

492
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,470
It's fine.

493
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,230
Mo,

494
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,060
I promise you

495
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,720
that the next time I come,

496
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,070
I will teach you swordsmanship,

497
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,600
alright?

498
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,870
Then let's make a pact, Uncle.

499
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,950
Okay.

500
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,230
Cross my heart and hope to die,

501
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,910
stick a needle in my eye.

502
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,190
Here, a stamp.

503
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,770
These ingredients

504
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,670
are all extremely rare

505
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,910
and exceptional medicines.

506
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,770
If you can gather them,

507
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,440
they will indeed be effective.

508
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,190
I'm back.

509
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,360
Honey, you're back.

510
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,760
Did the free clinic go well today?

511
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,060
Today, there was a child.

512
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,950
He's only six years old,

513
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,610
but has an incurable disease.

514
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,030
However, the doctor who's been treating him

515
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,190
is quite skilled

516
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,930
and has managed to extend his life until now.

517
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,710
This doctor

518
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,170
is on par with my disciple.

519
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,750
Unfortunately, even so,

520
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,790
that child

521
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,970
only has about two years left.

522
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,350
Everyone has their fate.

523
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,070
Didn't we choose to retreat from the martial world

524
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,630
and live in seclusion here

525
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,920
because we couldn't bear to see

526
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,430
the unpredictability in the martial world?

527
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,230
Retreat from the martial world.

528
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,900
But who would have thought that you,

529
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,070
Wei Fengxing, the fifth disciple from the Sword Sect,

530
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,550
the esteemed Mr. Dashing

531
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,230
in the martial world,

532
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,870
would even be unable to farm?

533
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,910
After all these years,

534
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,490
[Wei Fengxing, the fifth disciple of the Sword Sect]

535
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,200
you still haven't reaped any harvest.

536
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,550
I...

537
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,350
I can't farm,

538
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,190
but I can fish.

539
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,030
My Dashing Sword Technique is agile and light,

540
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,130
making it perfect for fishing.

541
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,930
You're using the Dashing Sword Technique to fish?

542
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,550
Have all the fish been sold today?

543
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,470
Of course.

544
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,030
I kept one

545
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,090
for ourselves to eat tonight.

546
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,990
I'd like some crucian carp tofu soup.

547
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,670
No problem.

548
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,150
Go take a rest.

549
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,250
Alright.

550
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,710
[Yangzhou]

551
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,910
[Linglong Flower Realm]

552
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:49,910
Put it here.

553
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,780
Yes.

554
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,630
Be careful.

555
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,100
Work hard.

556
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,990
Hurry up.

557
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,590
Clean it up.

558
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,430
We'll have guests arriving soon.

559
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:00,890
Okay.

560
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,570
Mr. Huo, you're here.

561
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,790
We haven't opened

562
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,990
for business yet.

563
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,310
Would you like to go to the private room?

564
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,800
You guys talk.

565
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,440
I'll go handle something in the back.

566
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,270
Why are you here in Yangzhou?

567
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,820
I came to Yangzhou to find someone

568
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,230
and happened to pass through Linglong Flower Realm,

569
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,230
so I specifically came to thank you.

570
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,870
Previously, Qin Tiancheng from the White Cloud Palace

571
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,870
died in Yangzhou.

572
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,630
If it weren't for your keen observation

573
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,630
in discovering the human skin mask,

574
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,830
it probably

575
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,550
would have been difficult for me to shake off the suspicion.

576
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,070
It was just a small effort.

577
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,070
You have a reputation for being chivalrous.

578
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,000
I didn't want to see a hero wronged.

579
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,390
This is...

580
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,390
Yes.

581
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,230
This is Miss Cheng Ting'er,

582
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,280
whom you rescued

583
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,440
from Linglong Flower Realm back then.

584
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,470
But don't get it wrong.

585
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,940
Miss Cheng returned of her own accord.

586
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,790
Last year,

587
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,350
Miss Cheng's father passed away,

588
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,950
and the man who she thought

589
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,470
that she could entrust

590
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,470
let her down.

591
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,230
With no other options,

592
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,670
she returned to Linglong Flower Realm.

593
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,430
Most of the girls here

594
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,270
are like that.

595
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,200
Life is unpredictable.

596
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,750
This piece

597
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,920
is quite beautiful.

598
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,320
This piece is called "Yue People's Song,"

599
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,540
a song of longing for home.

600
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,590
Miss Liu,

601
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,570
are you feeling homesick?

602
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,670
I've wandered everywhere since I was little

603
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,870
and have no hometown.

604
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,600
Wherever the person I care about is

605
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,070
that's my hometown.

606
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,510
Where

607
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,389
is the person you care about?

608
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,560
I haven't had the chance to ask you.

609
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,570
Who is the person you came to Yangzhou

610
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,810
to look for this time?

611
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,790
I'm looking for a wealthy merchant

612
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,490
to ask him about

613
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,360
the whereabouts of a medicinal ingredient.

614
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,140
If you trust me,

615
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,610
perhaps I can assist you a little.

616
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,550
Indeed.

617
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,110
You are a friend of many literary figures

618
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,220
and celebrities in Yangzhou.

619
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,750
You must be well-informed.

620
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,350
Thank you in advance.

621
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,750
So, who are you looking for?

622
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,190
A wealthy merchant with the surname Li,

623
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,230
who seems to be in the business of trade

624
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,360
beyond the frontier

625
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,420
and occasionally comes to Yangzhou to make purchases.

626
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,350
Well, you don't need to worry then.

627
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,790
This Mr. Li is actually

628
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,290
one of my guests.

629
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,330
When he comes next time,

630
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,660
I can ask him for you.

631
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,350
Will this put you in a difficult position?

632
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,460
Thank you for your concern.

633
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,540
Since he is my guest,

634
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,830
how could I be put in a difficult position?

635
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,030
It's just a question.

636
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,030
What is it you are looking for?

637
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,940
Millennial Crimson Cold Dragon Blood Pearl.

638
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Doctrine Leader!

639
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,470
I can't defeat him!

640
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,410
Miao Huo,

641
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,430
you're so useless.

642
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,070
I'm afraid I won't be able to keep you around.

643
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,030
I knew

644
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,070
you couldn't gain the upper hand

645
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,530
with Master White-Brows,

646
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,400
but I didn't expect you to be injured so badly.

647
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,040
The Doctrine Leader sent you here, didn't he?

648
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,510
Come on.

649
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,820
Come on!

650
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,170
I'd rather be killed by you

651
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,830
than go back and be fed to dogs!

652
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,490
What does that mean?

653
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,070
Are you giving me a head?

654
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,630
This is the head of Master White-Brows.

655
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,950
I've already held Miao Kong back.

656
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,520
He won't complete the task.

657
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,810
Take this back to report.

658
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,250
You're injured so badly.

659
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,030
I'm sure the Doctrine Leader will not suspect you.

660
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,230
Why did you help me?

661
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,320
If you don't believe me,

662
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,770
just throw it away.

663
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,780
Long live the Doctrine Leader.

664
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,060
Here is the head of White-Brows.

665
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,890
I've checked it many times.

666
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,640
It is indeed Master White-Brows.

667
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,480
Well done.

668
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,230
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

669
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,790
It seems

670
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,250
you've been seriously injured.

671
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,480
Thank you for your concern.

672
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,310
Well...

673
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,000
That White-Brows

674
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,070
was indeed quite formidable,

675
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,540
but with just a few punches,

676
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,470
he vomited blood

677
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,870
and leaned against a tree,

678
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,630
like this.

679
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,470
Alright.

680
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,760
Then he died.

681
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,100
Go and tend to your injuries.

682
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,590
Yes.

683
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,170
Have the others returned?

684
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,420
Only Miao Kong has not come back yet.

685
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,780
After he returns,

686
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,010
have him come to see me.

687
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,590
Now that I think about it,

688
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,250
he has served me for some time.

689
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,800
I should see him

690
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,650
one last time.

691
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:21,940
Yes.

692
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,720
Envoy Miao Shui.

693
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,350
I came on the Doctrine Leader's order

694
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,550
to take someone away.

695
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,870
The Doctrine Leader has appointed Eye to manage the Asura Field.

696
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,930
Any changes within the field

697
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,260
must be reported to him.

698
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,970
This matter needs to wait until Eye returns to...

699
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,700
Are you done?

700
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,340
The Doctrine Leader gave the Asura Field to Eye,

701
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,200
and he can take it back at any time.

702
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,070
Think carefully

703
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,380
about whom you are truly being loyal to.

704
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,450
Well...

705
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,310
I'll say it again.

706
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,240
This is the Doctrine Leader's directive.

707
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,310
The Doctrine Leader wants to see you.

708
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:20,970
Follow me.

709
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:31,910
Miao Kong,

710
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,780
you have served me for many years

711
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,280
and rarely let me down.

712
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,670
Doctrine Leader, please spare me this time.

713
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,950
I just made a mistake.

714
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,410
You are my right-hand man.

715
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,080
How could I bear

716
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,230
to let you just die?

717
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,030
Thank you, Doctrine Leader!

718
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,210
But your current position

719
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,070
has been targeted.

720
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,370
Whether you can stay or not

721
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,670
depends on you.

722
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,130
Greetings, Doctrine Leader.

723
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,710
Come on.

724
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,070
The one who stays

725
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,310
will become my Envoy Miao Kong.

726
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,510
Doctrine Leader.

727
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,230
Well done.

728
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,900
You truly are the most outstanding one

729
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,230
who fought your way out in this year's Asura Field.

730
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,030
His position

731
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,750
is now yours.

732
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,790
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

733
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,790
Aren't you going to change your mask

734
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,750
in the hall?

735
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,590
I'm ugly

736
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,310
and afraid it might disturb you.

737
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,150
Or is it that

738
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,680
you don't dare to show your real face?

739
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,660
Take off your mask.

740
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,870
