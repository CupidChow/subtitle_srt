[Episode 16]

4
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,510
Watching kids

5
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,229
is much more tiring than killing.

6
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,889
Mothers really have it rough.

7
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,170
Envoy Miao Shui.

8
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,930
The water is ready.

9
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,030
I'm so tired my cheeks are sunken in.

10
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,829
I'm starving.

11
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,650
I've to take a bath.

12
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
Go out for a while.

13
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,210
Who are you insulting?

14
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,190
I'm famous for being

15
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,920
a gentleman.

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,650
I won't peep at you bathing!

17
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,590
Besides,

18
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,829
what's there to see?

19
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:37,960
It'd better be true,

20
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,990
or I'll poke your eyes

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,590
blind.

22
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,750
Hurry up and wash up.

23
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,079
I can barely stay awake.

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,190
Seven.

25
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,800
Seventh Brother.

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,730
Why are you here?

27
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,460
Yuan Yi Palace's Miao Shui and Miao Huo

28
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,550
took away Longmen Village's children.

29
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,530
I tailed them all the way

30
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,730
to try to save them.

31
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,520
What about you?

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,760
Chief also got intel that

33
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,350
they're kidnapping kids everywhere

34
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,210
to create chaos

35
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,829
and lure the five disciples

36
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,760
of Sword Sect out

37
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,390
so that they could easily

38
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,520
assassinate Chief.

39
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,630
Chief said he long

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,070
wanted to eliminate Yuan Yi Palace

41
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,120
for the peace of the people.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,630
After this incident,

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,110
with the Central Plains' righteous sects,

44
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,310
we'll work together to eliminate them.

45
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,910
Chang Wujue

46
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,430
is really ruthless.

47
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,150
By the way,

48
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,640
with you two out,

49
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,430
are Eldest and Second Brothers protecting Chief

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,360
in the pavilion?

51
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,230
Before Chief got the intel,

52
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,310
he'd sent Eldest Brother

53
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,550
to the Central Plains.

54
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,150
He'll take a while to return.

55
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,310
Then isn't Chief

56
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,570
alone in the pavilion?

57
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,790
Seven, don't worry.

58
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,740
Chief has a plan

59
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,750
to stop Yuan Yi Palace

60
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,410
from attacking our pavilion.

61
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,190
If anything happens here,

62
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,880
I'll send him a message.

63
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,260
Okay.

64
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,910
Since Miao Huo and Miao Shui

65
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,470
of the Five Sages are here,

66
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,990
Why don't we work together

67
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,250
to catch them off guard

68
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,710
and save the kids in the chaos?

69
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,510
Don't do that.

70
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,590
Don't fight head-on.

71
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,130
The kids will get hurt.

72
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,390
This time,

73
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,730
we can only outsmart them.

74
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,710
Stop swishing around.

75
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,909
I can't sleep!

76
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,960
You're taking so long.

77
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,890
You'll lose ten pounds in one bath.

78
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,710
Are you done?

79
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,390
Don't look back.

80
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,670
Don't peek.

81
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,600
What's going on?

82
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,640
Are you deaf?

83
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,870
It's me yelling.

84
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,870
What noise?

85
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,790
Go have a look.

86
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,920
Why don't you go?

87
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,950
How can I go out naked?

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,120
We're both sages.

89
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,610
Why should I listen to you?

90
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,070
I'm not ordering you around.

91
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,870
It's inconvenient for me.

92
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,150
Handsome and suave Envoy Miao Huo,

93
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,490
please go have a look.

94
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,150
Women

95
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,680
are so troublesome.

96
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,790
Screw you!

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,290
Donâ€™t be scared.

98
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,590
Chief Xue of Apothecary Valley

99
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,720
asked me to save you.

100
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,560
Ms. Ye?

101
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,790
See?

102
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,490
I didn't lie to you, right?

103
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,600
We're saved.

104
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,460
We're saved.

105
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,760
Let's go.

106
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,850
Come on.

107
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,470
Hurry up. Keep up.

108
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:44,870
Hurry.

109
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,670
Keep up.

110
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,110
Go.

111
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,750
Go.

112
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,590
Well,

113
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,470
h-how about you

114
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,200
make a sound?

115
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,710
Useless!

116
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,159
What happened?

117
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,909
What took you so long?

118
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,310
Those bastards escaped!

119
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,630
Where's Miao Huo?

120
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,360
I don't know!

121
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,720
You don't have to go.

122
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,950
Where are you?

123
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,770
Why are you hiding?

124
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,770
I'll kill you!

125
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,770
Come out!

126
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,960
I'll kill...

127
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,030
You...

128
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,270
Do you have nothing better to do?

129
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,870
Why do you keep coming for me?

130
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,350
I can't beat you!

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,550
Not bad.

132
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,470
You recognize me at a glance now.

133
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,700
On New Year's Eve of the fourth year of the Huijia era,

134
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,190
you drank wine in Linglong Flower Realm

135
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,190
and owed them money for it.

136
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,030
I'm the one who

137
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,010
paid your debt.

138
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,710
You even knelt down

139
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,090
to thank me earnestly.

140
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,430
How could you forget?

141
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,150
On New Year's Eve of the fourth year of Huijia,

142
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,610
I wasn't even in Yangzhou.

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,990
Trying to deny it?

144
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,670
I'm not.

145
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm honest and upright.

146
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,710
I even admit murder and arson.

147
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,870
Why'd I be scared of this?

148
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,110
I said I wasn't there!

149
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,460
My mother was from a brothel.

150
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,120
I never drink at brothels.

151
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,950
Stop slandering me!

152
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,990
Am I mistaken?

153
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,370
You must be.

154
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,750
Impossible.

155
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,500
Fourth Brother

156
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,430
was with me.

157
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,070
He can testify for me.

158
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,390
You think I don't have an alibi?

159
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,190
I was busy with a mission

160
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,210
with Miao Shui.

161
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,030
So drinking at Linglong Flower Realm

162
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,030
was your mission.

163
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,910
No.

164
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,660
A mission at Mo Family Village.

165
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,950
Making merry at that village

166
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,990
was your mission?

167
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,720
I said I don't do that!

168
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,080
We were killing people!

169
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,630
Kill who?

170
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,130
Kill...

171
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,370
Villagers.

172
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
My master Qiushui He

173
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,790
killed them.

174
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,150
Yuan Yi Palace's men

175
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,270
are too inept to do that.

176
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,530
Hey, Yuan Yi Palace...

177
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,230
What is it?

178
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,690
On New Year's Eve of the fourth year of Huijia,

179
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,710
Mo Family's Village was slaughtered.

180
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,640
Yuan Yi Palace is the true culprit.

181
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,030
Am I right?

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,830
Your doctrine leader

183
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,230
set Celestial Alp Sect up

184
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,090
and made them the scapegoat.

185
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,550
Am I right?

186
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,330
Say something!

187
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,010
It's not quite a set up.

188
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,350
But that old man Qiushui was too greedy.

189
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,110
That's why he

190
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,110
could be framed.

191
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,830
You'd better

192
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,210
tell me everything.

193
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,310
Or I'll kill you right away.

194
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,270
I...

195
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,230
I... I...

196
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,270
At the critical moment,

197
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,930
everyone's dropped the ball.

198
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,840
The secret letter's been received,

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,970
so Sword Sect should

200
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,910
know our plan

201
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,000
and reinforced their defense.

202
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,510
Not only that,

203
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,670
I also heard that

204
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,250
Nangong Yanqi's leading men

205
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,250
to Yuan Yi Palace.

206
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,070
What?

207
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,750
What for?

208
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,100
To use the same trick of

209
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,430
subduing Yuan Yi Palace

210
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,760
while it's vulnerable.

211
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,430
We must return to

212
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,890
Yuan Yi Palace right away.

213
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,950
How do you know the intel's true?

214
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,590
I think

215
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,590
it's just a part of Sword Sect's

216
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,990
Nangong Yanqi's scheme.

217
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,570
We can't verify it.

218
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,150
But what if it's true?

219
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,350
Only Miao Feng's

220
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,470
with Doctrine Leader now.

221
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,830
He might be in danger.

222
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,510
But what if it's fake?

223
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,910
Can you bear the consequences

224
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,240
of failing the mission?

225
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,750
What do you mean?

226
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,440
You want to disregard our leader's safety?

227
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
I think our priority

228
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,880
should be the mission assigned by him.

229
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,200
Missions, missions.

230
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
Do you even care

231
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,110
about the leader?

232
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,390
Chief.

233
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,080
Mr. Zhou Xingzhi sent a letter.

234
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,030
He said...

235
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,880
he and Mr. Xia

236
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,790
met Mr. Seven

237
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,910
near Suzhou.

238
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,110
They have cooperated

239
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,440
to save Long

240
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,200
and the kids.

241
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,750
For now,

242
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,790
the kids

243
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,760
were sent to Sword Sect nearby.

244
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,440
They'll be sent here later.

245
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,390
Okay.

246
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,110
Well...

247
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,360
what about Huo Zhanbai?

248
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,070
He wasn't mentioned.

249
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,390
Chief.

250
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,730
Itâ€™s late.

251
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,430
Let's go back and rest.

252
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,350
Yuan Yi Palace might be the true culprit...

253
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,750
of the village massacre.

254
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,790
Snow Harrier.

255
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,430
Where's your master?

256
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,960
Why did you come back alone?

257
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,670
Yuan Yi Palace

258
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,990
really is involved in

259
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,250
the village massacre.

260
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,590
Where's Huo Zhanbai?

261
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,830
Is he in trapped

262
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,550
in danger

263
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,550
or seriously injured

264
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,950
and collapsed on the way?

265
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,070
Where are you going at this early hour?

266
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,230
I have somewhere to get to.

267
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,430
Is this for Mr. Seven?

268
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,440
It's a vast world.

269
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,700
How'd you look for him?

270
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,570
Snow Harrier will bring me to him.

271
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,720
Iâ€™ll go with you.

272
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,570
Time is running out.

273
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,030
I'll leave first by horse.

274
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,190
If he is seriously injured,

275
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,350
he can't ride a horse.

276
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,210
You and Feng Lyu

277
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,490
prepare a carriage and catch up with me.

278
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,890
But your cold disease...

279
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,530
I'm fine.

280
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,030
Huo Zhanbai!

281
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,790
Huo Zhanbai!

282
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,110
Huo Zhanbai!

283
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,600
Huo Zhanbai?

284
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,950
Chief.

285
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,470
Chief!

286
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,830
Chief, where are you?

287
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,270
Chief!

288
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,850
Chief!

289
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,870
Chief!

290
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,800
Hurry!

291
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,610
Chief!

292
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,250
Bring the medical kit!

293
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,000
Chief.

294
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,870
Chief.

295
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,710
Chief.

296
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,270
Chief.

297
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,470
Your cold disease has been triggered.

298
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,680
You must return to

299
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,570
the valley now.

300
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,780
If I go back now,

301
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,390
he will die here.

302
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,270
But...

303
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,590
Chief, your health...

304
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,470
Chief.

305
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,310
No, Chief.

306
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,320
-Chief.
-No.

307
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,470
Chief.

308
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,350
Chief!

309
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,050
Chief...

310
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,310
The Heat Pill can temporarily

311
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,430
quell the cold disease,

312
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,760
but it's just a stopgap.

313
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,800
After its effects wear off,

314
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,990
it'll backfire immediately.

315
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,720
Your condition will get worse.

316
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,750
If you're really worried about me,

317
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,010
prepare the medicine.

318
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,030
White peach blossoms,

319
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,830
hyacinth orchids,

320
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,690
and agrimonia.

321
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,710
Huo Zhanbai.

322
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,260
Huo Zhanbai.

323
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,470
Help him up.

324
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,570
Come on.

325
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,360
Huo Zhanbai.

326
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,950
Huo Zhanbai, wake up.

327
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,840
Huo Zhanbai.

328
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,080
Huo Zhanbai?

329
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,660
It's time for you to wake up.

330
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,360
Huo Zhanbai.

331
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,060
Huo Zhanbai!

332
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,310
Huo Zhanbai, wake up!

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,270
Wake up!

334
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,330
Huo Zhanbai.

335
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,870
Moâ€™s medicine...

336
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,390
Moâ€™s medicine isn't ready yet.

337
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,550
Wake up now!

338
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,790
You need to gather the herbs!

339
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,550
Huo Zhanbai!

340
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,080
Huo Zhanbai.

341
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,510
Huo Zhanbai.

342
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,950
Aren't you a loyal man

343
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,290
of your word?

344
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,590
You owe me so much money

345
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,520
in medical fees.

346
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,910
You have to pay me back!

347
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,270
I think you're just a scoundrel.

348
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,600
You broke your promise!

349
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,630
Not only do you

350
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,840
no longer care

351
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,750
for Mo,

352
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,350
but you're even refusing to pay me back!

353
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,470
Huo Zhanbai.

354
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,990
Huo Zhanbai.

355
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,660
Don't you want to try the Laughing at the World wine?

356
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,260
I've buried two jars

357
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,760
under the plum tree.

358
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,630
I wanted to share them

359
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,480
with you.

360
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,000
Get up now.

361
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,110
Wake up!

362
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,030
If you don't wake up,

363
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,220
I'll drink it all myself.

364
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,700
Don't blame me then!

365
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,780
Huo Zhanbai.

366
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,790
Huo Zhanbai.

367
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,150
Silly woman.

368
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,430
I'm not dead.

369
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,040
Then why are you lying here?

370
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
I thought I'm at Apothecary Valley,

371
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,870
so I laid here.

372
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,390
Do you have any news about Long and the kids?

373
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,280
Don't worry.

374
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,150
Your Fourth and Eighth Brothers

375
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,830
have sent them

376
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,290
back to Sword Sect safely.

377
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,970
That's good.

378
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,630
Thatâ€™s good.

379
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,320
Why did you leave the valley?

380
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,070
It's nothing.

381
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,750
Chief!

382
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,310
Chief!

383
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,390
Chief.

384
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,910
Chief's been out of the valley

385
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,640
for too long.

386
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,630
She has to get back now.

387
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,510
But the carriage

388
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,640
is stuck down there.

389
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,950
Leave it to me.

390
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,570
I'll send her back.

391
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,450
But Mr. Huo, you just...

392
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,510
Chief Xue's highly skilled.

393
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,190
Iâ€™m fine now.

394
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,530
I'll send her back by horse.

395
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,060
Help her up.

396
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,340
Come on.

397
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,350
Chief is back.

398
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,510
It's Chief!

399
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,670
Go now.

400
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,670
-Okay.
-Okay.

401
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,340
-Chief!
-Chief!

402
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,310
Whatâ€™s wrong with her?

403
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,790
Her cold disease relapsed.

404
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,450
She must get to the hot spring.

405
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,470
Wait.

406
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,470
Ziye took the Heat Pill.

407
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,210
The hot spring is useless.

408
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,960
Send her to the medicine hut.

409
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,510
Okay.

410
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,690
â™«We've crossed hundreds of rivers and scaled thousands of mountainsâ™«

411
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,270
â™«Why fear the coldness of fate?â™«

412
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:50,420
â™«If the night is lonely, I will be the lampâ™«

413
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,150
â™«And light up the rest of our livesâ™«

414
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:01,450
â™«Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destinyâ™«

415
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,340
How is she?

416
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,440
Is she awake?

417
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,670
Mr. Seven, donâ€™t worry.

418
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,710
She's safe for now.

419
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,750
â™«The past is like an unbearable illusion, yet I remain resoluteâ™«

420
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,350
She'll wake up soon.

421
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,440
That's good.

422
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:13,340
â™«Toasts exchanged, how many nights has snow fallen?â™«

423
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,160
That's good.

424
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:19,030
â™«The past fades with the dimming nightâ™«

425
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,000
Granny Ning.

426
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,480
Is something wrong?

427
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:25,230
â™«A lifetime with one person and one heart, all for a fleeting warmthâ™«

428
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,390
Back then, she floated

429
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,490
along an icy river

430
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:31,110
â™«Bit by bit, day by day, year by year, fragments of memoriesâ™«

431
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,350
all the way here.

432
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,150
Although Mr. Xuehuai

433
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,150
gave her the only floating ice,

434
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,170
â™«Gatherings, separations, joy and sorrow, the myriad facets of lifeâ™«

435
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,710
Ziye still

436
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,420
drifted in the water all night.

437
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:45,200
â™«Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regretsâ™«

438
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,310
The cold of the river had penetrated her bone marrows.

439
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,750
Since then,

440
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,550
she got the cold disease.

441
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,510
The former Chief Liao

442
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,880
gave her a prescription

443
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,170
for recuperation.

444
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,310
But she has been toiling

445
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,710
for years,

446
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,390
so her disease

447
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,780
has been getting worse.

448
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,310
The prescription

449
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,310
also isn't as effective

450
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,310
as before.

451
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,710
We can

452
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,670
only rely on

453
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,600
the hot spring in the medicine hut.

454
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,910
I brought this upon her.

455
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,070
Ziye should know how much

456
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,750
â™«Bid farewell in the first wastelandâ™«

457
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,610
you went through fire and water for her.

458
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,340
How could she ignore you?

459
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,790
â™«Only with flaws can it be considered completeâ™«

460
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,190
She probably hopes

461
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,750
no one would die

462
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,070
for her again.

463
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:31,190
â™«Bloom or wither, the snow is like meâ™«

464
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,980
I heard from Shuang Hong

465
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,750
that she couldn't rush back because she wanted

466
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,710
to save you,

467
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,030
â™«Both fearless and brilliantâ™«

468
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,390
so she took the Heat Pill.

469
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,990
That pill's very potent.

470
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,200
Besides,

471
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,190
â™«Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destinyâ™«

472
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,750
she was out

473
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,110
for too long this time.

474
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,490
â™«The past is like an unbearable illusion, yet I remain resoluteâ™«

475
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,350
After this bout,

476
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,310
it'll be harder for her

477
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,930
to leave the valley.

478
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:54,090
â™«Toasts exchanged, how many nights has snow fallen?â™«

479
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,780
â™«The past fades with the dimming nightâ™«

480
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,960
Granny Ning,

481
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,110
what can I do?

482
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,980
â™«A lifetime with one person and one heart, all for a fleeting warmthâ™«

483
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,110
You're injured.

484
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,330
You haven't rested, have you?

485
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,350
I'm fine.

486
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,860
â™«Bit by bit, day by day, year by year, fragments of memoriesâ™«

487
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,920
Ziye is

488
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,550
fine now.

489
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,630
You should

490
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,910
â™«Gatherings, separations, joy and sorrow, the myriad facets of lifeâ™«

491
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,300
go rest in your room.

492
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,430
Take good care of yourself

493
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,950
so her efforts to save you aren't in vain.

494
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:25,950
â™«Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regretsâ™«

495
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,830
Got it, Granny.

496
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,830
Mr. Seven.

497
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,150
Chief's warm bed

498
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:22,950
is burnt 24 hours a day.

499
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,750
She won't need so much firewood.

500
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,420
You should go back and rest for a while.

501
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,610
Besides, you havenâ€™t recovered.

502
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,010
Just take care of Chief.

503
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,210
Don't worry about me.

504
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,870
No!

505
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,990
Chief, youâ€™re awake.

506
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,510
Chief.

507
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,350
Youâ€™re awake.

508
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,390
Do you feel unwell?

509
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,120
Are you okay?

510
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:04,880
Chief.

511
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,840
Are you cold?

512
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,640
Here.

513
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,070
Careful.

514
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,470
Chief.

515
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,080
Iâ€™ll get you some water.

516
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,110
Mr. Huo!

517
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,430
Mr. Huo.

518
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,950
Chief is awake!

519
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,030
How long was I in a coma?

520
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,390
Itâ€™s been a while.

521
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,840
You were shouting "No."

522
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
Did you have a nightmare?

523
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,710
Did you dream of

524
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,110
the Mo Family Villagers?

525
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,200
â™«As the wind blows and the snow falls, the scent of plum blossoms sighsâ™«

526
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,350
I'm cold.

527
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,150
So cold.

528
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,080
â™«You nestle close, your whisper slow and tenderâ™«

529
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,670
Cold?

530
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,830
The warm bed is hot.

531
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,790
How could it be cold?

532
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,190
I...

533
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:10,330
â™«In the shadow, the stories of the heart remain untoldâ™«

534
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,930
My cold disease

535
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,540
is getting worse.

536
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,260
â™«The bright moon in clouds reminds me of yesteryearâ™«

537
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,750
Chief Xue!

538
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,610
â™«Drifting like smoke, I journey into the long nightâ™«

539
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:28,370
â™«In so deep, I'm trapped in the whirlpool of fateâ™«

540
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,949
â™«In this world, light takes your formâ™«

541
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,770
While you were in a coma,

542
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,370
Mr. Seven guarded you day and night,

543
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,239
â™«Following your direction, together we tread this pathâ™«

544
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,630
cutting firewood

545
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,239
and heating up the warm bed.

546
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,830
He never stopped.

547
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,510
â™«Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hateâ™«

548
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:51,610
â™«Eyes reddened, love etched on the heartâ™«

549
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,650
You've recovered?

550
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,710
How is your cold disease?

551
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,070
I'm fine.

552
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,410
Don't look at me like that.

553
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,110
I'm not dead.

554
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
It's all my fault.

555
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,280
It is all because of you.

556
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,190
I told you that

557
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,650
you just needed to save Long and the kids,

558
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,090
nothing else.

559
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,660
Why didn't you listen?

560
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,870
Fourth and Eight Brothers

561
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,800
were there then.

562
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,070
I knew they could guarantee

563
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,190
the kids' safety.

564
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,630
I also knew that

565
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,230
Yuan Yi Palace was involved.

566
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,020
But I didn't find out the truth in the end.

567
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,230
I even dragged you down.

568
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,310
Sorry.

569
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,550
So you

570
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,400
should pay with your life.

571
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,230
You saved my life.

572
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,250
You can do whatever

573
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,470
you want with me.

574
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,630
It was just a joke.

575
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,310
Don't worry about it.

576
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,160
We haven't found the truth,

577
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,350
but we gained one more clue.

578
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,750
I believe

579
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,310
the truth will

580
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,030
be revealed eventually.

581
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,190
But your health...

582
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,880
But what?

583
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,680
I hate

584
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,790
owing people favors.

585
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,310
This time,

586
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,070
we're even now.

587
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,600
In Apothecary Valley,

588
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,950
we enjoy all four unique seasons

589
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,410
with endless beautiful scenery.

590
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,950
Anyway,

591
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,390
I still owe you a big favor.

592
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,670
If you need me,

593
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,520
I'll do anything to help...

594
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,800
Although I've been in a coma for days,

595
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,430
I woke up at the right time.

596
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,810
Based on my calculations,

597
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,250
the epiphyllum

598
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,450
should bloom tonight.

599
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,440
You usually talk the most.

600
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,270
Today,

601
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,030
don't disturb the blooming of epiphyllum.

602
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,300
â™«Who is brewing the medicine, as the fragrance slowly filters through the window?â™«

603
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,980
â™«You lower your gaze, grinding herbs, your hand gently brushing my woundâ™«

604
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,810
â™«Following your eyes, I see the flowers fall softly into my palmâ™«

605
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,470
Have you seen epiphyllum bloom?

606
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,050
â™«I wish to speak, yet my thoughts remain unspokenâ™«

607
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:18,940
No.

608
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,850
What about you?

609
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,440
â™«White moonlight peers over the courtyard walls, spreading frost upon the groundâ™«

610
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,760
My grandfather always took me

611
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,070
to wait for epiphyllum to bloom.

612
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,250
â™«The night is long, and you adorn yourself behind the gauzeâ™«

613
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,350
Worried that a kid like me couldn't sit still,

614
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,110
he'd first go to

615
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,240
â™«The swaying shadows of the trees stir my heartâ™«

616
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,530
the market in the capital

617
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,710
and buy me lots of rice cakes...

618
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,650
â™«As we share stories of our pastsâ™«

619
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,270
so I could eat while waiting.

620
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,800
â™«Beneath the starlightâ™«

621
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,000
But every time,

622
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,710
I fell asleep

623
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,550
while eating.

624
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:48,400
â™«We exchange glances, like medicine simmering slowly over timeâ™«

625
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,050
I've seen epiphyllum many times,

626
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,830
but I've never

627
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,910
seen it bloom.

628
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,070
â™«In the dim light, the person in my dream remains sereneâ™«

629
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,750
Now that I think about it, it's quite funny.

630
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,010
â™«Your dark hair cascades over your white robesâ™«

631
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,210
I always made a scene about seeing it,

632
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,590
but I missed it time and again.

633
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,780
â™«From this moment on, the distance between us will be as long as time itselfâ™«

634
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,880
â™«New medicine heals old wounds, aged wine cools with timeâ™«

635
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,990
You will see it today.

636
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,580
I hope so.

637
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,030
â™«A melody fills the air, and the one before me stands unmatchedâ™«

638
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,590
Seeing this epiphyllum,

639
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,350
I'm getting hungry.

640
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,430
â™«The evening breeze invites the sunset, and rouge gently blushes beneath the moonâ™«

641
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,630
It reminds me of

642
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,650
the rice cakes my grandpa bought me.

643
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,730
â™«Though fate is uncertain, I shall always remember your faceâ™«

644
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,990
If it's fresh

645
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,750
with chewy skin

646
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,750
and soft filling,

647
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,060
it's really good.

648
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,130
The capital is only forty miles away.

649
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,960
If you're really craving it,

650
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,080
I'll bring it back to you next time.

651
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,190
Rice cakes only taste good

652
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,530
when freshly made.

653
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,810
Don't bother.

654
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,240
What's wrong?

655
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,170
They really bloomed!

656
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,290
Beauty that makes your heart flutter

657
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,390
is just a brief moment of epiphyllum blooming.

658
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,570
It's very brief

659
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,470
but very memorable.

660
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,370
Rosy clouds are fleeting

661
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,960
and glass shatters easily.

662
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,580
Good things in this world

663
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,270
are all fragile.

664
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,100
Don't act tough anymore.

665
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,330
This time, it landed you

666
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,800
in a days-long coma.

667
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,270
If you didn't wake up in time,

668
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,110
you would've missed

669
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,440
the moment of blooming.

670
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,190
What if you

671
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,400
act tough again and miss something

672
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,000
next time?

673
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,390
So naggy.

674
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,070
I'm serious.

675
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,020
Okay, okay.

676
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,690
No matter who it is next time,

677
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,080
no matter what happens,

678
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,790
I won't lend a helping hand.

679
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,590
Happy?

680
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,560
It's a pity how brief

681
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,190
the blooming is.

682
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,680
Dispersed clouds will reconvene.

683
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,750
If glass is handled with care,

684
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,910
it won't shatter.

685
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,510
But when flowers bloom is fixed.

686
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,450
It's destined to be a brief encounter.

687
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,230
If a brief moment

688
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,600
is etched on your heart,

689
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,450
it's also eternal.

690
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,670
There's a time to bloom

691
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,320
and a time to wither.

692
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,240
There's no turning back.

693
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,690
But as long as you grasp the moment of beauty,

694
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,800
there'll be no regrets.
