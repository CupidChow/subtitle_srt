00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,280
She and I reached an agreement.

5
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,830
When Laughing at the World is ready,

6
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,910
I'll go back to drink with her.

7
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,160
It seems you and I are alike.

8
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,730
We both belong somewhere.

9
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,160
What do you plan to do

10
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,390
when this is over?

11
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,950
Why don't you go back to Guazhou Town with me

12
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,240
and be neighbors

13
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,829
with me and your sister-in-law?

14
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,120
They'll run a clinic together.

15
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,110
We'll farm

16
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,190
and fish together.

17
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,870
It's indeed an idyllic life.

18
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,030
But I don't know

19
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,810
if it's the life she wants.

20
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,510
She has a cold disease.

21
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,070
She can't go too far.

22
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,130
I'm afraid her body can't take it.

23
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,850
Then you...

24
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,560
I will return to the Apothecary Valley

25
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,990
and stay by her side.

26
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,830
I hope

27
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,960
on every year's Mid-Autumn Festival,

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,510
I can go to the market

29
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,350
and enjoy fireworks with her.

30
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,710
I hope I can witness

31
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,390
every blossom of the epiphyllum with her.

32
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,520
Every time it snows,

33
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,390
the sun goes down, and the moon rises,

34
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,650
I hope I can be with her,

35
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,750
waiting for the moon,

36
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,400
listening to the sound of snow,

It will.

41

All right.

42
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,550
Have a drink with me

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,480
or go back to rest early.

44
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,310
Okay.

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480

No offense.

92
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,330
I need to check all the herbs

and tools.

94
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,060
You want to check my medicine box?

95
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm just worried

96
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,630
you still have

97
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,590
something like

98
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,720
Tenacious Needles.

99
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,870

at his bedside,

101
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,990
I need to ensure nothing will go wrong.

102
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,270
What if I refuse?

103
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,660
Then I'm sorry.

104
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,510
I can't believe you.

105
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,350
If I really want

106
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,390
to poison him,

107
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,070
I would use something like the Soul Devouring Powder.

108
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,160
Since you don't believe me,

109

please send me back

110
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,790

You,

120
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,720
stay here.

121
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,230
Yes.

122
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,310
Go.

123
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,830

Okay.

Doctrine Leader.

128
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,110
Chief Xue,

129
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,550
you're finally here.

130
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,200
Let me check your pulse first.

131
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,870
Come on.

132
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,990
How is it?

133
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,030
Your illness

134
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,450
stems from improper practice of cold-natured internal skills,

135
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,220
resulting in a disturbance of your inner balance.

136
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,780
It's been a month and 17 days.

137
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,760
Your internal Chi is out of control and leaking.

138
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,790
Your Triple Burner meridians are in disarray,

139
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,670
and every acupuncture point is swollen.

140
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,070
Every midnight, it feels

141
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,190
as if thousands of needles are piercing you,

142
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,650
causing unbearable pain.

143
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,310
Am I right?

144
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,680
You're indeed a miracle-working doctor.

145
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,950
Since the onset of your illness,

146
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,710
you must have tried

147
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,910
various treatments.

148
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,360
But sadly, none of them was effective,

149
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,490
and your condition has deteriorated.

150
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,670
Tell me.

151
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,350
How long will it take to cure me?

152
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,510
You should ask

153
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,050
whether you can be cured first.

154
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,910
Is that necessary?

155
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,910
You're a miracle-working doctor from the Apothecary Valley.

156
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,220
If you can't cure me,

157
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,750
I guess my death is fated.

158
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,630
Yeah.

159
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,790
You have mastered

160
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,770
your mental technique very well.

161
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,030
In this world,

162
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
there should be

163
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,470
no other method that can harm you.

164
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,310
If it weren't for the disturbance of your inner balance,

165
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,190
I guess

166
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,900
there truly is nothing

167
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,630
that could pose a threat to you.

168
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,630
Stop beating around the bush!

169
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,270
Tell me!

170
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,070
Can you cure me or not?

171
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,670
I...

172
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,110
I can.

173
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,310
Okay.

174
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,590
I knew it.

175
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,050
You won't let me down.

176
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,980
The Apothecary Valley's medical expertise is top-notch.

177
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,590
I won't be disappointed.

178
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,230
Chief Xue,

179
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,130
let's continue.

180
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,470
Then I'll use golden needles to restore the acupuncture points

181
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,750
based on the Apothecary Valley's secret book

182
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,150
to smooth the meridians all over your body.

183
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,270
Doctrine Leader, please keep your promise.

184
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,330
After you recover,

185
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,590
let me out of here.

186
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,490
Chief Xue, don't worry.

187
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,900
I'll keep my promise.

188
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,590
Okay.

189
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,590
This is the Zijin Meridian Powder,

190
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,190
which can smooth meridians.

191
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,040
Please take it immediately.

192
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,350
It will take effect

193
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,550
in 15 minutes.

194
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,830
Then I can use golden needles on you.

195
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,790
Feng.

196
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,940
This is Benzoin,

197
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,840
known for its soothing and analgesic effects.

198
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,100
Please burn it in the incense burner now.

199
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,040
Doctrine Leader, please turn around.

200
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,890
Let's get started.

201
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,390
Please relax your meridians.

202
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,080
You have to stop your inner breath.

203
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,150
Scary?

204
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,310
It's not that easy

205
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,470
to obtain this position.

206
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,180
Chief Xue,

207
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,910
let's begin.

208
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,910
Doctrine Leader is receiving treatment inside.

209
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,110
Don't

210
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,210
disturb him.

211
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,950
Everyone, leave.

212
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,590
Leave.

213
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

214
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,470
Lastly, the acupuncture points on your spine

215
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,600
have been smoothed.

216
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,350
All the golden needles are ready.

217
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,070
Almost done.

218
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,620
Almost done.

219
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Only one step left.

220
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,430
Done.

221
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,430
So soon?

222
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,930
Jerk!

223
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,030
This is for

224
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,910
the villagers

225
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,060
of the Mo Family Village killed by you!

226
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,910
Feng,

227
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,110
you also...

228
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,610
Doctrine Leader, please don't kill her.

229
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,110
Do you want her to kill me?

230
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,960
No.

231
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,130
Chief Xue, you…

232
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,670
Sorry.

233
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,000
You...

234
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,710
Jerk,

235
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,550
I advise you not to use your Chi.

236
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,230
Or you'll die sooner.

237
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,420
So you've conspired with each other.

238
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,470
Yes!

239
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,550
Go to hell!

240
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,350
It's really not easy

241
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,070
to kill you.

242
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,710
Xue Ziye is responsible

243
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,310
for sealing your meridians.

244
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,390
I'm responsible for finding a chance

245
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,430
to kill you.

246
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,560
I wanted

247
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,890
to capture Miao Feng when he was

248
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,930
about to save you.

249
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,550
But the person he wanted to save

250
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,710
was not you.

251
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,670
You deserve it.

252
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,750
The children you raised with your own hands

253
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,550
will betray you sooner or later.

254
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,030
You want him to save you?

255
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,070
He can't save you.

256
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,190
You're like a devil.

257
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,850
You should have died long ago!

258
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,000
It takes the poison of the Dragon Blood Pearl

259
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,050
to kill you!

260
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,350
Why?

261
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,810
You're asking me why?

262
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,910
You're asking me why?

263
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,990
What, Doctrine Leader?

264
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,820
Have you killed so many people in this life

265
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,960
that you can't remember clearly?

266
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,270
21 years ago,

267
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,820
Sang State was destroyed overnight

268
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,280
near Luopu.

269
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,630
Have you forgotten?

270
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,870
You are not from Yuzhou.

271
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,660
I'm from Sang State.

272
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,910
You are...

273
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,710
Princess Shan Mi.

274
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,790
Now you remember.

275
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,830
My father was defeated by Yuzhou that year.

276
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,310
The people of Sang State

277
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,240
had to abandon the city and escape.

278
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,650
You took money from Yuzhou Lord.

279
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,230
You sent assassins, who disguised as bandits,

280
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,150
to exterminate my clan.

281
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,800
I escaped alone

282
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,830
and became a slave in a foreign land.

283
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,030
But when I was 15,

284
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,510
you bought me.

285
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,190
It's fate, isn't it?

286
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,750
Even God wants me to kill you!

287
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,200
For this moment,

288
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,890
I've put up with you for so many years

289
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,480
and I've suffered so much

290
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,230
hardship and torment!

291
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,120
Old jerk!

292
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,350
Today,

293
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm going to avenge

294
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,930
the people of Sang State!

295
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,270
Remember,

296
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,970
the last thing you see before you die

297
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,600
is the smiling face of a Sang State's citizen.

298
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,550
I should have... killed you.

299
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,670
You no longer have a chance.

300
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,750
Old jerk.

301
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,110
Sister.

302
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,950
Envoy Miao Feng,

303
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,040
since Doctrine Leader is dead,

304
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,200
you don't need

305
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,830
to stay alive either, right?

306
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,430
Miao Shui!

307
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,710
Miao Shui!

308
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,870
You promised me

309
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,410
you wouldn't kill him.

310
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,620
Miao Shui.

311
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,310
Chief Xue,

312
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,260
I admire your courage.

313
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,990
But your stupidity

314
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,650
makes me want to laugh!

315
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,310
You don't know martial arts.

316
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,170
What do you have to make an agreement with me?

317
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,430
An agreement is upheld

318
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,310
through power.

319
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,390
Otherwise, it would just be empty talk.

320
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,150
Understand?

321
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,990
You...

322
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,320
And I really don't understand.

323
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,680
You already know

324
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,950
Miao Feng was the reason

325
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,090
why you fell into the icy river back then, right?

326
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,570
Why do you want to save him?

327
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,990
He's just...

328
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,990
a sword

329
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,270
used by someone.

330
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,750
Just like you and Mingjie.

331
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,910
The target

332
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,830
of the sword

333
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,780
is decided

334
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,790
by the one holding the sword.

335
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,310
Fine.

336
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,060
I admire you.

337
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,340
But even though you don't want to kill him,

338
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,310
I will take his life.

339
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,750
No.

340
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,230
-Stop!
-Envoy Miao Feng.

341
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,520
Don't blame me for killing you.

342
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,390
If I let you live,

343
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,350
I won't have a way out.

344
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,350
At this point,

345
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,870
it would be great if we can end everything

346
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,390
like this.

347
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,710
What exactly is on your mind?

348
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,110
After I die,

349
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,630
can you let Chief Xue go?

350
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,910
She's not a threat to you.

351
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,910
If you need a doctor

352
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,990
in the future...

353
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,780
I really don't understand you two.

354
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,430
You're going to die,

355
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,630
but you're still defending each other.

356
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,710
Feng,

357
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,950
how come I never knew

358
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,720
besides Doctrine Leader,

359
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,030
there is another person

360
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,950
in this world

361
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,310
you care about so much?

362
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Please let her go.

363
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,990
I'll be grateful.

364
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,510
It depends...

365
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,910
on my mood.

366
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,510
Ya Mi!

367
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,860
What did you call him?

368
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,340
What did you call him?

369
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,400
Ya Mi.

370
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,620
That's his real name.

371
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,670
Miao Feng?

372
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,220
Impossible.

373
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,900
Impossible.

374
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,740
You're not Ya Mi.

375
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,540
How could you be Ya Mi?

376
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,830
Impossible.

377
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,310
My brother was very timid.

378
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:23,930
He...

379
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,950
He couldn't even hold a sword well.

380
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,630
He was so timid.

381
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,650
How could he become

382
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,170
a killer like you?

383
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,990
You're not him.

384
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,060
You're not him.

385
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,550
I accepted the enemy as my father

386
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,780
and helped him do bad things.

387
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,050
Sister, I ignored

388
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,070
your suffering.

389
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,050
At this point,

390
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,310
why bother to reunite?

391
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,550
Yes.

392
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,590
Ya Mi did die a long time ago.

393
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,140
I lied to you.

394
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,750
Watch out!

395
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,090
Sister, watch out!

396
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,820
Ya Mi!

397
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,910
Ya Mi!

398
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,270
Ya Mi!

399
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,150
Ya Mi!

400
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,070
Ya Mi! Ya Mi!

401
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,110
My brother.

402
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,680
I didn't recognize you earlier.

403
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,370
Ya Mi!

404
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,670
Don't move.

405
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,550
Let me see.

406
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,480
It's been more than 20 years.

407
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,250
I raised you and taught you.

408
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,350
But in the end,

409
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,560
you both want me to die,

410
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,950
right?

411
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,430
Fine.

412
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,670
Kids,

413
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,110
die with me!

414
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,950
Miao Shui.

415
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,790
Miao Shui!

416
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,610
Sister!

417
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,230
You...

418
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,390
Ya Mi.

419
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,790
Ya Mi!

420
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,950
No.

421
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:09,550
Chief Xue.

422
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,150
Ya Mi.

423
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,270
Don't...

424
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,600
Don't do anything stupid.

425
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,429
Ya Mi.

426
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,590
Just now,

427
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,030
you and your sister refused to reunite

428
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,560
because you were thinking for each other.

429
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,980
Now she's gone.

430
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,909
Maybe to her,

431
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,449
it's a way to break free.

432
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,110
You...

433
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,550
You should stay alive.

434
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,420
I want to go down there

435
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,550
to collect her body.

436
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,230
Leave here first.

437
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,270
Come back to collect her body

438
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,190
when the time is right.

439
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,170
What your sister wanted the most

440
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,710
is that you

441
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,030
can leave here safely.

442
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,270
You already know

443
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,650
I was the one who made you

444
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,180
and Xuehuai fall into the icy river back then.

445
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,190
Why did you save me?

446
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,970
I spent a lot of time

447
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,670
thinking about it.

448
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,910
If you really wanted

449
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,810
to kill that carter,

450
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,530
you wouldn't have given him

451
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,770
an ingot of silver.

452
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,110
You just knocked him out.

453
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,630
Right?

454
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,750
Chief Xue.

455
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,800
The Soul Devouring Powder?

456
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,830
You transferred the Soul Devouring Powder

457
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,030
from Eye to yourself!

458
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,140
You've always been aware of Eye's identity?

459
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,350
He's my brother.

460
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,830
You were Chang Wujue's pawn,

461
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,180
just like Mingjie.

462
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,360
The one who should be blamed

463
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,030
is the mastermind.

464
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,380
I told you I would protect you.

465
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,640
But I...

466
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,790
But…

467
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,570
Chief Xue!

468
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,740
I've regained

469
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,240
all my power?

470
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,030
Chief Xue.

471
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,040
The Apothecary Valley.

472
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,890
The Apothecary Valley.

473
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,560
The Apothecary Valley.

474
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,730
-The Apothecary Valley.
-I'm going to take you back now.

475
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,830
Bad news!

476
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,950
Doctrine Leader is dead!

477
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,230
Doctrine Leader is dead?

478
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,460
-Doctrine Leader is dead?
-Doctrine Leader...

479
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,320
-Miao Feng!
-Doctrine Leader...

480
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,670
Miao Kong.

481
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,290
Doctrine Leader is dead.

482
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,630
The palace will surely be in chaos.

483
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,020
You stay and take charge of the overall situation.

484
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,880
What about you?

485
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,630
I need to send Chief Xue back

486
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,290
to the Apothecary Valley now.

487
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,200
Get out of my way!

488
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Let them go.

489
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,990
It's good that you want to leave.

490
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,890
It can save trouble for both of us.

491
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,150
Chief Xue.

492
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,650
Are you feeling better?

493
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,380
Don't worry.

494
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,610
We're about to arrive at Yueya Vale soon.

495
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,410
Hang in there.

496
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,310
We can arrive at the Apothecary Valley soon!

497
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,140
Miao Kong?

498
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,550
What are you doing here?

499
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,630
I'm here to make a deal with you.

500
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,750
There's nothing

501
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,150
to talk about between us.

502
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,330
Chang Wujue is dead.

503
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,880
How did he die?

504
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,810
Miao Feng, Miao Shui,

505
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,270
and Chief Xue

506
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,800
from the Apothecary Valley

507
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,350
killed him together.

508
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,000
Chief Xue?

509
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,130
Where is she?

510
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,510
She has left the palace safely.

511
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,020
Chang Wujue is dead.

512
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,120
I will help you become the Doctrine Leader.

513
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,150
What?

514
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,160
Are you not interested in being

515
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,650
the Doctrine Leader just because

516
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,390
you failed once?

517
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,480
What is your condition?

518
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,120
Help me get rid of the Seven Swords.

519
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,910
After it's done, we'll dominate the martial world together.

520
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,430
I want to be

521
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,270
Sword Sect's chief.

522
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,480
Sword Sect?

523
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,310
Who on earth are you?

524
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,730
I'm Envoy Miao Kong of the Yuan Yi Palace.

525
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,270
I'm also

526
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,050
the sixth disciple of Sword Sect.

527
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,740
You're the sixth disciple of Sword Sect,

528
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,390
Xu Chonghua?

529
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,710
I haven't heard

530
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,110
of this name for a long time.

531
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,360
Why should I trust you?

532
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,070
The Seven Swords of Sword Sect

533
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,630
are on their way here.

534
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,990
They will not let you go.

535
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,120
Collaborating with me

536
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,030
is your best choice now.

537
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,310
The Seven Swords?

538
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,520
Huo Zhanbai, right?

539
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,800
You hold a deep grudge against Huo Zhanbai.

540
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,590
You've always wanted to kill him, right?

541
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,750
But

542
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,470
his life

543
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,710
is mine.

544
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,350
Why do you want to kill him?

545
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,810
That is between me and him.

546
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,360
I can't tell you.

547
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:27,910
Anyway,

548
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,430
when the Seven Swords arrive here,

549
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,140
I need you to use your Eye Magic

550
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,070
to help me.

551
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,320
Okay.

552
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,770
Deal.

553
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,200
There is someone ahead!

554
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,350
I think it's Five Sages from the Yuan Yi Palace.

555
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,550
It's Envoy Miao Feng!

556
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,510
Stop him!

557
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,590
The Spring Breeze mental technique.

558
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,850
Be careful, everyone!

559
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:31,790
Be careful!
