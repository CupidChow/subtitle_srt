00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,460
The Moon Sect

5
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,720
had bamboo slips with records about the Mo Family Village?

6
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,910
That's right,

7
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,550
but in the fight that day,

8
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,820
I cut those bamboo slips.

9
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,670
I don't know if there are any clues left.

10
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,550
You've been to the Apothecary Valley many times.

11
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,280
Has Chief Xue never mentioned anything about it?

12
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,270
What are you thinking about?

13
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,520
If you don't tell me,

14
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,079
I'll go ask Chief Xue directly.

15
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,010
Fourth Brother.

16
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,710
Don't go.

17
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,370
Even if you're not curious,

18
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,610
I am.

19
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,550
Actually,

20
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,770
I once asked her

21
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,990
how she ended up in the Apothecary Valley.

22
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,710
But it seemed that it was very private,

23
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,710
and she didn't want to talk about it.

24
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,829
It's already not gentlemanly

25
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,270
for us to make assumptions.

26
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,930
We shouldn't ask her about it.

27
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:02,990
Alright.

28
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,240
You're a gentleman,

29
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
and I'm not, okay?

30
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm just trying to help you.

31
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,750
With what?

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,760
Figure it out yourself!

33
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,070
When I was 14 years old,

34
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,329
I fell into an icy river

35
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,750
and caught a chill.

36
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,190
His name is Xuehuai.

37
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,630
Without him,

38
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,890
I'd have become a pile of ashes…

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,280
or been eaten by fish.

40
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,660
That day…

41
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,230
was just as cold as this.

42
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,130
Every time my cold disease relapses,

43
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,790
I wonder…

44
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,420
when he was

45
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,630
soaking in the icy river alone,

46
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,190
if it was hundreds of times more painful and colder

47
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,690
than how I feel.

48
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,230
Master,

49
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,470
how have you been lately?

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,140
I need to ask you about something.

51
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,430
On New Year's Eve of the fourth year of Huijia,

52
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,390
in a village called the Mo Family Village,

53
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,190
over 100 people died overnight.

54
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,630
That village is located in the territory of the Celestial Alp Sect.

55
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,510
I wonder if you

56
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,350
have ever heard about it.

57
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,870
If you have any clues,

58
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,010
please write a letter to the Apothecary Valley.

59
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,750
Best wishes, your disciple, Zhanbai.

It's early in the morning. Where did you…

64
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,240
I went out last night

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,300
and just came back.

66
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,310
Is Chief Xue up?

67
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,390
Chief just returned from collecting Rootless Water.

68
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,120
She's in the Summer Garden now.

69
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,290
You want to see her?

70
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,270
No.

71
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,430
Seven, you're back.

72
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,540
When I opened my eyes

73
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,600
and didn't see you,

74
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,080
I thought you had gone down the mountain.

75
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,390
No.

76
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,360
I just went for a walk.

77
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,420
Are you still thinking about Chief Xue's matter?

78
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,240
You're leaving?

79
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,570
If I stayed any longer,

80
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
I'd be too insensitive, wouldn't I?

81
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,340
I just learned from Feng Lyu

82
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,050
that Chief Xue has been using the money she got paid

83
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,560
to treat the villagers nearby

84
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,750
and provide them with medicine.

85
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,970
She also uses the money

86
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,300
to take care of orphans.

87
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,540
Although Chief Xue resides in the Apothecary Valley,

88
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,800
she cares so much for the people outside.

89
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,470
I misunderstood her before,

90
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,070
thinking she was mercenary.

91
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,280
Turns out I jumped to conclusions.

92
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,610
Before I leave,

93
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,670
I need to say goodbye properly

94
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,710
to her.

95
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,870
Let me remind you,

96
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,470
don't mention

97
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,430
the Mo Family Village massacre in front of her.

98
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,600
You've already said

99
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,310
that's a personal thing.

100
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,630
Why would I be so thick-skinned

101
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,830
and bring it up again?

102
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,630
Although

103
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,750
I'm indeed very curious.

104
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,230
I think you'd better not go.

105
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,560
I don't think you can hold it in.

106
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,810
I'm just about to set off

107
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,950
to search for the next herb.

108
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,010
I'll pack up in a bit

109
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,090
and leave with you.

110
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,070
You should just stay here

111
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,270
for recuperation.

112
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,070
Don't leave until Chief Xue

113
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,070
allows you to.

114
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,590
Come in.

115
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,740
Chief wants you

116
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,230
to go to the medicine hut for a check-up.

117
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,060
If everything's fine,

118
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,460
you've fully recovered.

119
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,970
I'll be right over.

120
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,940
I'll go with you.

121
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,490
If you have anything to say,

122
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,750
I can pass it on for you.

123
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,419
You said you're afraid

124
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,030
I'll mention the Mo Family Village massacre,

125
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,740
but that's just an excuse, isn't it?

126
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,870
It's a serious matter.

127
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,669
How could I possibly joke about it?

128
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,360
I just…

129
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,750
You just think we shouldn't

130
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,610
pry into Chief Xue's private affairs,

131
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,070
right?

132
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,950
Alright.

133
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,790
Off you go.

134
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,150
There's nothing you want to say to her?

135
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,870
No.

136
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,840
30 minutes as usual.

137
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,070
You're usually very talkative.

138
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,690
Why are you so quiet today?

139
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,910
Nothing.

140
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,550
It turns out

141
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,150
she's endured so much alone.

142
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,680
If you want to ask something, go ahead.

143
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,110
Nothing.

144
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,020
You've been acting strange these past few days.

145
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:21,830
I…

146
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,430
I'm just getting impatient.

147
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,220
Can't wait to go search for the next herb.

148
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,580
I'm getting impatient too.

149
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,030
After all, you and your brother

150
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,750
have stayed in the valley for so long.

151
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,010
It's been quite noisy.

152
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,830
You've almost fully recovered.

153
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,090
You can finally leave.

154
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,550
Then,

155
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,730
I'll set off

156
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,880
to get the next herb.

157
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,270
Qianyu will leave the valley with me.

158
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,920
He asked me to say goodbye to you on his behalf.

159
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,670
If he's willing

160
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,110
to continue repaying your debt,

161
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,640
the Apothecary Valley welcomes him anytime.

162
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,480
What's this?

163
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,230
The herb Dragon's Tongue grows on steep cliffs.

164
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,030
If you want to get it, bumps and scratches are inevitable.

165
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,870
I made this medicine for wounds myself.

166
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,470
If you're slightly injured,

167
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,270
you can use it.

168
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,790
Thank you.

169
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,530
No need.

170
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,470
I just don't want

171
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,470
to exhaust myself saving you again.

172
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,510
The cliffs are dangerous.

173
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,220
Don't die.

174
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,660
You haven't paid off your debt yet.

175
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,480
Fourth Brother,

176
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,450
after you go back,

177
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,050
give my regards to the chief.

178
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,030
Okay.

179
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,360
You just focus on collecting herbs for Mo.

180
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,400
I'll handle the affairs

181
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,390
of the Sword Sect.

182
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,740
Okay.

183
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,590
Thank you in advance, Fourth Brother.

184
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,430
It's fine.

185
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,320
Actually,

186
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,310
back in Yangzhou,

187
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,570
I kind of took it out on you.

188
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,350
I know.

189
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,110
You know?

190
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,470
It was because of Fifth Brother.

191
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,390
I know that you

192
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,950
and Fifth Brother, Wei Fengxing,

193
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,510
roamed

194
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,590
the martial world together since childhood.

195
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,230
You're known as the White Feather Swordsman

196
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,430
and he as Mr. Dashing.

197
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,310
Your stories

198
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,070
are known to everyone in the martial world.

199
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,600
It's just that Fengxing

200
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,440
suddenly changed his mind.

201
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,350
It's said he got married and had children,

202
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,210
became a good husband and father,

203
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,770
and vanished from the martial world.

204
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,490
Not long after he disappeared,

205
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,950
I killed Chonghua.

206
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,030
In just half a year,

207
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,190
the Sword Sect

208
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,320
lost two of its eight major disciples.

209
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,510
I know that

210
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,470
you've always valued brotherhood,

211
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,360
so you must feel very upset.

212
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,650
Fengxing is the worst.

213
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,870
It's fine that he didn't tell you all,

214
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,730
but he should've at least told me.

215
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,600
Alright.

216
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,510
Anyway, once I have news about Fengxing,

217
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,830
I'll tell you immediately.

218
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,600
Who cares?

219
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,590
Tell me if you want.

220
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:26,850
He still owes me

221
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,310
several hundred taels of silver for drinks.

222
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,430
Seven.

223
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,670
Stop looking.

224
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,720
There's plenty of time in the future.

225
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,270
Let's go.

226
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,790
Chief.

227
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,190
Come in.

228
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,270
What's it?

229
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,310
Chief,

230
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,750
Mr. Seven and Mr. Xia

231
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,910
have left the valley.

232
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,420
When I was cleaning the guest room just now,

233
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,560
I found that Mr. Seven had left

234
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,690
his wine flask here.

235
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,750
How careless.

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,670
Chief, did you think of something?

237
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,670
You look so happy.

238
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,150
Nothing.

239
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,940
[Ping'an Inn]

240
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,990
-Huo!
-Brother Meng.

241
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,590
Mrs. Meng.

242
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,060
Look at him.

243
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,790
Huo.

244
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,390
Come on, have a seat inside.

245
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,250
What a lovely surprise to see you!

246
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,910
Make him feel at home.

247
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,440
Sit down.

248
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,470
Let me

249
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,800
bring you some wine.

250
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,550
No need.

251
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,070
I'll just have some hot tea

252
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,400
and get back on the road.

253
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,470
Huo,

254
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,550
it's been so long since you last visited.

255
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,150
Let me

256
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,710
warm some wine

257
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,470
and stew some mutton for you.

258
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,930
You can leave after you eat it.

259
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,790
You're so kind.

260
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,270
Forget that.

261
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,480
Go stew some mutton.

262
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,870
Alright, I'm on it.

263
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,990
Dad, Mom,

264
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,260
come out.

265
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,510
What's wrong?

266
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,300
What happened?

267
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,750
I was chopping wood just now

268
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,390
and fell.

269
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,350
Tai tried to protect me

270
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,990
and injured his leg.

271
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,400
I'm fine. It's not serious.

272
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,040
I hope the bone is fine.

273
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,150
Tai,

274
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,350
let me take you to see a physician.

275
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,880
Let's go.

276
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,710
Brother Meng.

277
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,660
I happen to have some medicine.

278
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,350
Here.

279
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,890
It's a wound-healing medicine.

280
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,150
It's very effective for treating external injuries.

281
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,970
Thank you, Mr. Huo.

282
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,570
Thank you.

283
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,350
It may hurt.

284
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,000
Here.

285
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,510
It's alright.

286
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,000
Hang in there.

287
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,430
Hang in there.

288
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,260
Does it hurt?

289
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:28,670
No.

290
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,760
Here's the mutton stew.

291
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,710
Here.

292
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:33,790
Huo.

293
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,830
You guys enjoy it.

294
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,170
Thank you, Mrs. Meng.

295
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,470
You may go.

296
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,530
Eat while it's hot.

297
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,790
Tai and Chu

298
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,510
just got married last month.

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,800
A few days ago,

300
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,460
they went to see a physician.

301
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,990
He said she's pregnant.

302
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,900
That's great news.

303
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:51,970
Yes, indeed.

304
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,650
Here. Congratulations.

305
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,910
Thank you.

306
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:01,950
Thank you

307
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,790
for that medicine today.

308
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,690
You should thank

309
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,220
the person who gave it to me.

310
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,390
Well,

311
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,200
year after year,

312
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,490
you've been running around everywhere.

313
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,869
It's good.

314
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,150
Having a place to settle down

315
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,109
is good.

316
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,910
Even birds know to build nests.

317
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,960
People also need a shelter.

318
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,630
That's what we call home.

319
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,420
Right.

320
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:31,870
Home.

321
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,990
This year,

322
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,110
my wife

323
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,150
made a lot of October White, a king of wine.

324
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,270
When you leave,

325
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,850
take some with you.

326
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,750
Is that friend of yours

327
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,150
a man or a woman?

328
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,550
A woman,

329
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,120
but she also likes to drink.

330
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,830
Great!

331
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,550
Then bring her a jar of it.

332
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,150
Let her try it too.

333
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,830
Give me your wine flask later.

334
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,870
I'll fill it up for you.

335
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,270
Okay.

336
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,990
Thank you, Brother Meng.

337
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,320
Here,

338
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,430
try this.

339
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,920
You're saying

340
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,220
you killed everyone

341
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,480
in the Celestial Paradise?

342
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,160
Yes.

343
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,690
I selected those people personally.

344
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,250
You just killed them on a whim?

345
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,440
Doctrine Leader, you once said

346
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,770
I could do as I pleased with those people.

347
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:15,670
Eye.

348
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,340
Do you know

349
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,950
the flower

350
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,820
called the blue poppy?

351
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,230
It takes ten years for it

352
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,090
to sprout and bloom.

353
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,200
But unfortunately…

354
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,230
Unfortunately,

355
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,490
this kind of flower

356
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,420
only blooms once in its lifetime.

357
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,010
After the fleeting splendor,

358
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,830
it wilts quickly

359
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,960
and dies.

360
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,310
Eye.

361
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,880
Those people should be very grateful to you.

362
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,240
Because it's you

363
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,050
who let them bloom once in this life.

364
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,140
I wasn't wrong about you.

365
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,470
Rise.

366
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,630
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

367
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,070
As for those nutrients…

368
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,280
Miao Kong,

369
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,390
take those nutrients

370
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,470
to my garden.

371
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,910
Let them nourish my flowers.

372
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,510
Yes.

373
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,240
Now that the White Cloud Palace's

374
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,700
Seven Star Sword Formation has been broken,

375
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,630
isn't it time

376
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,870
we pay a proper visit

377
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,330
to the Celestial Alp Sect?

378
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,940
Good idea, Doctrine Leader.

379
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,010
For many years,

380
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,510
the Sword Sect, the White Cloud Palace, and the Celestial Alp Sect

381
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,020
have been closely allied.

382
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,110
When one is in trouble, the other two will provide support.

383
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,440
To break this alliance,

384
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,260
you destroyed the White Cloud Palace's

385
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,790
Seven Star Sword Formation

386
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,950
and sowed discord between the White Cloud Palace

387
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,100
and the Sword Sect.

388
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,590
Then you killed Qiushui He from the Celestial Alp Sect.

389
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,470
This way,

390
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,730
when the Sword Sect is in trouble,

391
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,190
the White Cloud Palace and the Celestial Alp Sect

392
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,320
will be too preoccupied to offer help.

393
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,510
The Sword Sect will inevitably end up

394
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,710
in an isolated and helpless situation.

395
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,230
Feng.

396
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,470
You know me better than anyone else.

397
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,270
Then I'll give this important task

398
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,670
to Ming Li, Miao Huo, and Miao Shui.

399
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,870
You'll go together.

400
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,440
We won't

401
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,970
fail you, Doctrine Leader.

402
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,260
Oh no!

403
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,670
This was the birthday gift Senior Zhanbai

404
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,270
gave to our chief two years ago.

405
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,000
Chief has always cherished it.

406
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,590
Please punish me, Chief.

407
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,760
I broke

408
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,710
the teacup

409
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,190
Senior Zhanbai gave you

410
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,550
by accident.

411
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,430
It's alright.

412
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,950
Get up.

413
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,230
Yes.

414
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,150
Are you hurt?

415
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,200
Chief,

416
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,190
just a small scratch, nothing serious.

417
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,520
Go apply some medicine.

418
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,110
Someone else will take care of this.

419
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,950
But...

420
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,830
Go.

421
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,750
Thank you, Chief.

422
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,630
Chief.

423
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,330
Senior Zhanbai has sent a letter.

424
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,490
The Mo Family Village?

425
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,990
[Mount Jun, Dongting]

426
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,590
Master?

427
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,710
Zhanbai?

428
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,200
Greetings, Master.

429
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,190
Good.

430
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,390
Master,

431
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,320
why are you here?

432
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,420
I came here to look for an herb for Mo.

433
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,350
Dragon's Tongue?

434
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,150
Yes.

435
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,510
Zhanbai,

436
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,320
all these years,

437
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,630
to cure Mo,

438
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,520
you've gone through a lot.

439
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,610
It's completely fine.

440
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,020
I know you.

441
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,910
Even if it was hard, you wouldn't say it.

442
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,630
I know, in the past few years,

443
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,420
you've been running around

444
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,990
and doing everything you can

445
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,670
for Mo.

446
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,920
I really appreciate it.

447
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,230
I

448
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,220
planned to pick the herb Dragon's Tongue

449
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,280
and send it to the Apothecary Valley.

450
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,240
But since I've met you here,

451
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,110
I'll let you

452
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,390
take it to the Apothecary Valley.

453
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,350
Thank you, Master.

454
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,230
Don't mention it.

455
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,080
As Mo's grandfather,

456
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,070
I should've done something for Mo long ago.

457
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,110
Mo is my family too.

458
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,750
To save him,

459
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,370
I'll certainly do my best.

460
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,670
Moreover…

461
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,260
Zhanbai.

462
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,540
When I brought you into the Celestial Alp Sect,

463
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,570
you were only three years old.

464
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,350
In my eyes,

465
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,160
you and Yin are the same.

466
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,110
You're both my children.

467
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,170
Yin has gone through a lot.

468
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,070
I suppose she

469
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,070
has already moved on.

470
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,680
The road ahead is treacherous.

471
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,260
I don't want you

472
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,190
to move forward

473
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,910
with such a heavy burden.

474
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,020
It's time

475
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,280
for you

476
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,950
to let go.

477
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,430
I understand.

478
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,680
It's been a long time since I met Yin and Mo.

479
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,350
To be honest,

480
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,170
I really miss them.

481
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,190
Junior Yin and Mo

482
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,480
should be in the valley for a follow-up now.

483
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,990
Master,

484
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,310
why don't you go back to the valley with me

485
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,110
to see Mo?

486
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,910
Is that so?

487
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,640
They're in the Apothecary Valley too?

488
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,790
Yes.

489
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,350
Okay.

490
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,030
Then I'll go with you.

491
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,410
By the way, Master,

492
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,470
in my previous letter,

493
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,960
I mentioned the massacre at the Mo Family Village.

494
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,820
Have you found anything about it?

495
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,530
The Mo Family Village?

496
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,870
Zhanbai.

497
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,670
Sorry

498
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,050
that I have to disappoint you.

499
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,710
I sent people out to investigate it for a long time,

500
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,470
but they found nothing.

501
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,390
That village was wiped out quietly,

502
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,530
and it happened so many years ago

503
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,760
without leaving a single clue behind.

504
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,590
As a righteous sect in the martial world,

505
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,950
we should see it as our duty

506
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,390
to uphold justice.

507
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,590
Rest assured.

508
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,040
Such a tragedy happened

509
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,290
in the martial world.

510
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,480
I'll get to the bottom of it.

511
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,590
By the way,

512
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,270
how did you come to know about this?

513
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,950
Do you have any clues?

514
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,870
I was on my way to get a herb

515
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,010
when I passed by that village.

516
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
I saw traces of burning and killing.

517
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,960
After inquiring,

518
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,890
I learned what happened back then.

519
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,670
I see.

520
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,520
I'll keep an eye out.

521
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,760
As soon as there's any news,

522
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,400
I'll tell you immediately.

523
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:04,870
Okay.

524
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,540
Good.

525
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,320
Let's go.

526
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,910
Chief Xue,

527
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,550
how is Mo's condition?

528
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,910
His condition is stable.

529
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,320
I'll give him some nourishing medicines.

530
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,190
They can calm his mind and replenish his energy.

531
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,390
Thank you, Chief Xue.

532
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,470
Mo,

533
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,990
thank Chief Xue.

534
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,730
Thank you.

535
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,710
By the way,

536
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,170
every time I came to the valley for a follow-up,

537
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,900
my senior wasn't in the valley.

538
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,860
I wonder when he left the valley

539
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,940
this year.

540
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,630
Is he coming back soon?

541
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,430
Every time he returned with a herb,

542
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,350
he only stayed in the valley

543
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,350
for a month or two.

544
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,230
After recovering from his injuries,

545
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,430
he'd leave in a hurry to search for the next herb.

546
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,630
If you want to see him,

547
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,870
just stay in the valley

548
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,800
and wait for him.

549
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,550
That'd be an imposition.

550
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,350
I'll take Mo

551
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,470
to the Longmen Village at the foot of the mountain

552
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,800
and find a place to stay.

553
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,280
No need for that.

554
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,470
Mrs. Qiushui,

555
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,710
having a beautiful lady like you

556
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,470
in the valley

557
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,030
and seeing you every day

558
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,450
would be quite a pleasure.

559
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,250
So stay as long as you like.

560
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,320
Thank you very much, Chief Xue.

561
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,750
Zhanbai.

562
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,360
Be careful. It's poisonous!

563
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,270
You're poisoned.

564
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,150
Chief,

565
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,320
are you alright?

566
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:17,790
I'm fine.

567
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:39,960
Let's hurry back.

568
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,310
Okay.

569
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,190
Chief.

570
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,040
What are you looking at?

571
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,440
Mr. Seven is back.

572
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,830
Looks like

573
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,120
he's seriously injured again.

574
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,350
Miss, you have an extraordinary aura.

575
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,830
You must be Chief Xue.

576
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,850
I'm Qiushui He.

577
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,630
Pleasure to meet you.

578
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,190
Qiushui He?

579
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,630
You're the chief of the Celestial Alp Sect,

580
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,890
Huo Zhanbai's master?

581
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,550
Zhanbai is severely injured.

582
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,310
Don't just stand there.

583
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,710
Take him into the valley.

584
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,160
This time, you didn't bring back a herb

585
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,930
but brought back your master.

586
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,810
Father?

587
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,190
Yin?

588
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,910
Mo.

589
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,030
Mo,

590
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,160
this is your grandpa.

591
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,990
Grandpa, Grandpa,

592
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,320
what are you doing here?

593
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,030
I'm here to see you, Mo.

594
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,110
Let me see.

595
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,610
Have you grown taller?

596
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,230
Have you grown stronger?

597
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,490
He's grown taller.

598
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,270
You've grown taller.

599
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,310
Chief Xue.

600
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,990
Is Zhanbai alright?

601
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,230
His condition

602
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,240
has stabilized.

603
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,430
I need to wait for him to wake up

604
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,160
before continuing treatment.

605
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,550
Father,

606
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,160
what happened?

607
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,430
Zhanbai went to the Celestial Alp Sect

608
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,680
to find me

609
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,190
and get Dragon's Tongue.

610
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,390
I heard that you and Mo

611
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,880
are also in the Apothecary Valley,

612
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,890
so I decided to come back with him

613
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,700
to see you.

614
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,670
Unexpectedly,

615
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,310
on our way back,

616
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,370
we met assassins from Yuan Yi Palace.

617
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,090
Zhanbai got severely injured

618
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
trying to save me.

619
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,430
I brought this upon him.

620
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,070
This is Dragon's Tongue.

621
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,400
Before Zhanbai lost consciousness,

622
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,130
he told me to give it to Chief Xue for safekeeping.

623
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,380
It was for the herbs again.

624
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,010
Over these past few years,

625
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,950
I've watched him return

626
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,680
with herbs time and time again,

627
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,950
either poisoned

628
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,150
or covered in blood,

629
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,139
as if he'd never get tired.

630
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,840
My master…

631
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,120
Your master is fine.

632
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,670
Dragon's...

633
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,600
Dragon's Tongue

634
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,600
has been placed in the ice cave.

635
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,850
How did you know…

636
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,230
How did I know what you wanted to ask?

637
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,210
You're still so caring and selfless,

638
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,330
Mr. Seven.

639
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,750
After waking up,

640
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,670
you first asked about your master,

641
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,670
then about the herb that can save Mo.

642
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,190
You only thought about yourself at last.

643
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,280
Why can't I speak properly?

644
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,890
Your throat is damaged.

645
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,550
It's a permanent disability.

646
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,750
When speaking,

647
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,190
you'll sound like you did just now,

648
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,470
and your throat will hurt like it's being cut by a blade.

649
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,890
You'll also be short of breath

650
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,380
with a hoarse and unpleasant voice.

651
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,150
Maybe

652
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,210
you'll become mute in the future.

653
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,830
But that's not so bad.

654
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,910
In the past,

655
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,760
you talked too much every day,

656
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,510
harming yourself without realizing it.

657
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,150
From now on, you can talk less,

658
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,470
which is not only less noisy

659
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,110
but also can earn you a good reputation

660
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,870
for selflessly seeking herbs to save someone.

661
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,670
It's worth it.

662
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,030
You want to ask

663
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,490
when you can fully recover

664
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,590
so you can seek the next herb for Mo?

665
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,050
You'll need to stay in the valley for a while.

666
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,570
I just said it was a permanent disability

667
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,730
to scare you a bit,

668
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,050
but you were not scared at all.

669
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,470
When I said you couldn't leave to collect herbs for now,

670
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,000
you became very concerned.

671
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,950
This time,

672
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,110
you shouldn't be in a hurry to leave.

673
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,710
Mo and Mrs. Qiushui

674
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,000
are in the valley now.

675
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,120
Turn around.

676
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,120
Show me your shoulders.

677
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,910
Your hair.

678
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,370
Stay still.

679
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,110
Turn around.

680
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,960
♫As the wind blows and the snow falls, the scent of plum blossoms sighs♫

681
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,850
♫You nestle close, your whisper slow and tender♫

682
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:33,100
♫In the shadow, the stories of the heart remain untold♫

683
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,040
♫The bright moon in clouds reminds me of yesteryear♫

684
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,370
♫Drifting like smoke, I journey into the long night♫

685
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:51,340
♫In so deep, I'm trapped in the whirlpool of fate♫

686
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,750
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

687
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,650
♫Not to make my mark, just to make it all worth it♫

688
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,380
♫Traveling through hustle, you became my hope♫

689
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,390
♫Try to hide tears; how can I ever forget you?♫

690
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,100
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

691
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,380
♫Following your direction, together we tread this path♫

692
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,650
♫Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hate♫

693
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,150
Gua sha isn't just about using brute force.

694
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:33,750
♫Eyes reddened, love etched on the heart♫

695
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,540
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

696
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,290
♫Following your direction, together we tread this path♫

697
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:50,560
♫Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hate♫

698
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,990
♫Eyes reddened, love etched on the heart♫

699
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,440
That cough sounded smooth.

700
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,510
It seems you've recovered a bit.

701
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,800
Try saying something.

702
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,010
You're a bad woman.

703
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,470
I kindly saved you,

704
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,200
and that's what you want to say?

705
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,740
Although my voice is back,

706
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,820
why does it still hurt so much when I speak?

707
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,190
No way.

708
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,030
Looks like your injuries are very serious this time.

709
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,710
You'll need to stay in the valley for a few more months,

710
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,840
perhaps half a year.

711
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,070
It doesn't hurt anymore.

712
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,710
It stopped hurting instantly.

713
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,110
It doesn't hurt anymore?

714
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,970
No, it doesn't.

715
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,860
Chief Xue, you're a wonderful doctor

716
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,720
with miraculous medical skills.

717
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,040
Thank you very much.

718
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,350
I heard that this time

719
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,830
you were injured trying to save

720
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,560
your master.

721
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,610
I was an orphan when I was young.

722
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,630
Master adopted me

723
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,710
and gave me a second home.

724
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,950
I see him as my father.

725
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,350
When he was in danger,

726
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,920
I naturally had to do my best

727
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,780
to protect him.

728
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,030
All these years,

729
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,550
you've risked your life to collect herbs for Mo.

730
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,230
Is it really worth it?

731
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,610
As long as Mo can recover,

732
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,790
everything is worth it.

733
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,510
You're seriously injured this time.

734
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,510
You need to rest for the next few days.

735
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,310
Remember to take your medicine.

736
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,650
Don't use my inner energy.

737
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,910
I know.

738
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,910
Thanks.
