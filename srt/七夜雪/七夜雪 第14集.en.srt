4
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,130
When I was dying,

5
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I know

6
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,820
Chief Xue

7
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,090
saved my life.

8
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,829
I'm guilty.

9
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,550
I don't deserve this.

10
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,790
It's all my fault.

11
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,370
I was too stubborn.

12
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,110
I feel guilty towards Chief Xue.

13
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,070
Zhanbai.

14
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,040
Tell Chief Xue that

15
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,710
I’m willing to reveal

16
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,670
my crimes against the Mo Family Village

17
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,070
and accept my punishment.

18
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,350
The people from the Sword Sect are here too.

19
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,950
Okay.

20
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,510
But

21
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,030
before they

22
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,990
take me away,

23
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,950
I have another

24
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,420
important thing to do.

25
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,560
It's me.

26
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,399
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,800
Death is not enough to atone

28
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,170
for the sin I've committed.

29
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,630
I'm willing

30
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,560
to go to the Sword Sect

31
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,030
and accept my punishment,

32
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,030
and expose my sins

33
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,870
to the public

34
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,310
to be criticized by the people.

35
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,730
I only hope your souls in heaven

36
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,830
can rest in peace.

37
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,710
Master.

38
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,160
Chief Qiushui.

39
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,280
We'll get the horse ready.

40
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,740
Zhanbai.

41
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,590
Do you remember

42
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,830
when you were nine,

43
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,190
you said you'd be

44
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,950
a hero in the future?

45
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,120
I asked you then

46
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,230
if you knew

47
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,750
what a hero was.

48
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,630
How could I not remember?

49
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,870
I was young and ignorant.

50
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,000
You patiently explained things to me.

51
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,470
A hero

52
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,430
does good deeds

53
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,830
and upholds justice.

54
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,990
Because of my greed,

55
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,140
I committed a huge sin.

56
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,350
That is already unforgivable.

57
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,590
Then I wanted

58
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,950
to cover up the evil deed

59
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,710
and intended to harm someone.

60
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,160
Fortunately, Chief Xue

61
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,670
and you

62
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,590
stopped my evil thoughts.

63
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,190
Zhanbai.

64
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,080
I know you value relationships and bonds.

65
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,990
Don't blame yourself for this.

66
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,950
I won't blame you.

67
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,190
Rather, I'm glad that

68
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,590
you made up your mind

69
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,510
to hand me over to the Sword Sect.

70
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,030
Remember,

71
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,670
no matter what happens,

72
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,070
you must put justice first.

73
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,430
I'll keep that in mind.

74
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm afraid

75
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,070
I have to break my promise.

76
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,990
I must trouble you to seek

77
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,990
the herbs yourself now.

78
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,070
Let's part here.

79
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,020
Seven, don't worry.

80
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,150
We'll take good care of

81
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,010
Chief Qiushui.

82
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,590
When we reach the Sword Sect,

83
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,920
I'll send you a message.

84
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,150
Thank you.

85
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,450
Xiao Cheng.

86
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,870
This horse loves

87
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,750
the grass here.

88
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,470
Xiao Cheng,

89
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,630
prepare more for it later.

90
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,430
Look, its fur is dark and bright.

91
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,380
Chief.

92
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,790
Chief.

93
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,640
How is it?

94
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,710
Almost done.

95
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
By the way, Chief,

96
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,510
you spent a small fortune

97
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,990
on this horse a few years ago.

98
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,430
It’s a pity to just give it

99
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,830
to Mr. Seven.

100
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,470
Yes, Chief.

101
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,990
This horse is very smart.

102
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,430
It's a good horse.

103
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,270
Such a good horse.

104
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,710
It would be a pity

105
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,630
to keep it confined here.

106
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,210
I seldom leave the valley.

107
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,110
I might as well

108
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,590
entrust it to a good master.

109
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,990
You're right.

110
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,550
Besides, this horse

111
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,230
knows the way back to the Apothecary Valley.

112
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,830
If Mr. Huo is really injured,

113
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,470
this horse

114
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,330
will bring him back to the valley.

115
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,870
It’s almost time.

116
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,580
Send it out of the valley.

117
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,830
-Yes.
-Yes.

118
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,990
By the way.

119
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,510
If Mr. Seven asks,

120
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,950
tell him the horse was a gift from a patient.

121
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,630
Why?

122
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,030
Yes. Why?

123
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,970
Why, Chief?

124
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,440
There’s no reason.

125
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,030
You talk too much.

126
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,350
Come and work.

127
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,970
Drinking when you're upset is the most harmful to your health.

128
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,270
Have some ginger soup

129
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,400
to warm yourself up.

130
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,720
Thank you.

131
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,830
In this world,

132
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,000
beyond right and wrong,

133
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,270
good and evil,

134
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,860
there's also emotion.

135
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,250
He is your master after all.

136
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,760
I should thank you instead.

137
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,430
Chief.

138
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,950
-Mr. Huo.
-Mr. Huo.

139
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,070
A patient didn't have enough medical fees,

140
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,000
so he paid with this horse instead.

141
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,470
Chief said

142
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,910
the trip to Qingling for Snow Poppy

143
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,770
is long and far.

144
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,710
You can ride it.

145
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,070
This is obviously a prized horse

146
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,390
from the Western Region.

147
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,920
It's highly sought-after.

148
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,110
Who was willing to use this horse

149
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,030
to pay the debt?

150
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,750
Someone who isn't shameless, obviously.

151
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,830
Unlike someone

152
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,550
who doesn't even think about paying off

153
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,880
his long-overdue debt.

154
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,000
Aren't I working at the orphanage

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,910
whenever I'm free

156
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,970
to pay off the debt?

157
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,540
Your work

158
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,850
isn't enough to pay the interest.

159
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,350
It is said that this horse can travel a thousand miles a day

160
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,610
and connect with its master's feelings.

161
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,550
If it can help you

162
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,610
avoid some danger,

163
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,630
it'll save me the trouble of healing you.

164
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,180
And you won't have to incur new debts

165
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,980
before you settle your old debt.

166
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Thank you.

167
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,800
I told you someone else used it to pay the debt.

168
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,070
Feng Lyu.

169
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,390
These are the herbs

170
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,430
for Brother Meng.

171
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:03,950
And this.

172
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,030
This safety lock

173
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,090
is for Chu's child.

174
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,630
It's so precious.

175
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,910
I’ll thank you

176
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,030
in Chu's place.

177
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,890
That's enough.

178
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,210
It’s late. Why are you still here?

179
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,550
[Ping'an Inn]

180
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,470
So pretty.

181
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,910
Brother Meng.

182
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,320
Here.

183
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:07,910
The friend

184
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,440
I mentioned to you last time

185
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,970
said she drank Chu's wedding wine

186
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,910
and liked it a lot.

187
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,710
So she got me to bring some gifts.

188
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,550
She's being too polite.

189
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,030
Father.

190
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,040
This gift box

191
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,400
is from Brother Huo too.

192
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,350
I heard that

193
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,820
the cold medicine from the Apothecary Valley

194
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,630
is very effective.

195
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,230
All sects give this

196
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,480
to each other as gifts.

197
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,390
It's getting cold lately.

198
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,450
What a timely gift.

199
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,120
Thank you, Brother Huo.

200
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,070
It's my pleasure.

201
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,870
Bring the wine over.

202
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,710
Go now.

203
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,270
Okay.

204
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:34,690
Okay.

205
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,510
The wine I gave you last time

206
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,030
was brewed by my wife.

207
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,830
She can brew as much wine

208
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,570
as you want.

209
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,160
If your friend likes it,

210
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,830
you can bring her along.

211
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,750
Unfortunately, she has a cold disease.

212
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
She can't leave her house for too long.

213
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,150
You're here, aren't you?

214
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,550
If she likes it,

215
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,670
you can send it to her.

216
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,350
You are right, Brother Meng.

217
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,360
I warmed the wine.

218
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,000
It's perfect to drink now.

219
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,380
Pour it for him.

220
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,230
It's okay.

221
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,260
I'm not a stranger,

222
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,590
no need for formalities.

223
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,310
Alright, off you go.

224
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,830
Okay.

225
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,110
Okay.

226
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,790
Enjoy your wine.

227
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,210
I'll go check if the mutton my wife

228
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,690
is cooking for you is ready.

229
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,150
Okay.

230
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,950
The valley has a suture contest every year

231
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,010
and Shuang Hong is always the winner.

232
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,660
Chief,

233
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,230
why don’t we change the contest

234
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,829
next year?

235
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,960
What do you want to change it to?

236
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,180
How about knife skills?

237
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,900
We'll cut the tofu here.

238
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,829
After you master suturing,

239
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,910
we can have the knife skills contest.

240
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,190
Stop.

241
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,590
The stitches are skillful

242
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,470
and tidy.

243
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,750
Feng Lyu was right.

244
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,430
The first place this year

245
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,600
must be Shuang Hong.

246
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,310
Thank you, Chief.

247
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,600
Shuang Hong.

248
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,260
This box of silver needles has been with me for years.

249
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,890
Today, I'll give it to you.

250
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,710
I’ll entrust you with the valley's suturing work

251
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,630
in the future.

252
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,350
Thank you, Chief.

253
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,920
Check out this hand warmer.

254
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,870
Take it.

255
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,430
Okay.

Hand warmers for sale.

257
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,030
Steamed buns.

258
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,590
Miss, come and take a look.

259
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,190
Let me see.

Hand warmers for sale.

261
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,810
Newly-made hand warmers.

262
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,030
Sir,

263
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,510
you look strong.

264
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,910
You don't need a hand warmer.

265
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,840
Are you buying it for someone else?

266
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,270
Is it for someone you like?

267
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,000
It's for a friend

268
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,350
who is more important than normal friends.

269
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,590
I apologize.

270
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,510
The four of you together

271
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,350
failed to kill Qiushui He?

272
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,070
Doctrine leader.

273
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,850
This time, that Huo Zhanbai

274
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,870
who pretended to be my father

275
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,630
intercepted again.

276
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,490
If not, I alone could...

277
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,510
I don't want to hear

278
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,770
your excuses anymore.

279
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,590
I didn't do my job well.

280
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,590
Please punish me.

281
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,590

282
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,830
Miao Huo.

283
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,630
Go to the Snow Prison to receive your punishment.

284
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,310
Yes.

285
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,780
Eye.

286
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,510
This is your second failure.

287
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,290
I'm willing to make up for my mistake

288
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,710
and make Qiushui He disappear forever.

289
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,350
No need.

290
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,230
Qiushui He has entered the Sword Sect.

291
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,990
The Sword Sect is heavily guarded.

292
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,750
It's not easy

293
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,070
to kill him.

294
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,190
Then I will go south immediately

295
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,150
and wait for the chance

296
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,030
to kill him.

297
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,830
Eye.

298
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,310
I have the final say

299
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,230
on who you must kill.

300
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,990
Understand?

301
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,760
Reflect on yourself under the sun.

302
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,470
Yes.

303
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,350
I have something important to report to you.

304
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,210
It's about the Mo Family Village.

305
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,430
Tell me.

306
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,750
During the Mo Family Village massacre,

307
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,680
apart from the survivor we know of,

308
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,840
there was actually another survivor.

309
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,550
Who?

310
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,780
Xue Ziye, Chief of the Apothecary Valley,

311
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,690
When Xia Qianyu and Zhou Xingzhi, the fourth

312
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,110
and eighth disciples of the Sword Sect,

313
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,030
took Qiushui He from the Apothecary Valley,

314
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,900
they didn't seem to be asking him

315
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,420
to participate in something important.

316
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,030
On my way back,

317
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,550
I carefully investigated

318
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,150
and found out what happened.

319
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,310
I didn't do my job well back then.

320
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,670
Please punish me.

321
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,950
Looks like another one

322
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,910
got away.

323
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,350
Now the whole martial world thinks

324
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,070
that Qiushui He massacred the Mo Family Village.

325
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,230
Then we'll let

326
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,520

327
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,750

330
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,830
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

331
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,500
You brought back

332
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,830
such interesting news.

333
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,390
Consider it making up for your mistake.

334
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,310
Rise.

335
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,110
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

336
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,950
Do you need me

337
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,030
to get rid of her?

338
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,430
No need.

339
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,790
She managed to save Qiushui He

340
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,990
from Eye's grasp.

341
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,150
As expected from the martial world's

342
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,280
miracle healer Xue.

343
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,690
We'll let her live for now.

344
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,700
One day, I will make her regret

345
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,720
that she didn't die on that New Year's Eve.

346

[Young Miao Feng]

Emissary Miao Feng.

348

Are you regretting it?

349
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,230
Do you regret that

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,990
you took

351
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,390
so many lives back then?

352
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,550
Do you regret hurting

353
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,250
your chess friend?

354
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,290
Emissary Miao Feng.

355
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,610
Don't forget that

356
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,030
the reason you can

357
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,590
learn the Spring Breeze mental technique

358
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,750
is because your mind

359
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,440
is extremely simple and pure.

360
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,710
Besides the Doctrine Leader's safety,

361
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,350
you have no distractions.

362
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,180
According to the Doctrine Leader,

363
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,780
you have to watch the sun for 12 hours this time.

364
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,550
If you fail again in the future,

365
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,550
I'm afraid the time will be doubled.

366
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,550
Eye.

367
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,990
Aren't your most proud

368
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,390
of your eyes?

369
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,790
But eyes

370
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,760
can't fight against the sun.

371
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,150
Enjoy it.

372
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,030
Didn't you want to make up for your mistake?

373
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,830
Xiaoyao Villa

374
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,140
refused to submit to Yuan Yi Palace

375
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,340
and heed the Doctrine Leader's orders.

376
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,500
Go

377
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,430
and get the head

378
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,160
of the Xiaoyao Villa's chief.

379
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,030
Mr. Li?

380
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,270
Mr. Li.

381
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,220
Why are you here?

382
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,550
My body is hopeless.

383
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,230
My head

384
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,950
is hurting again.

385
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,360
Let's go.

386
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,470
Enter the valley.

387
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,510
Okay.

388
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,550
Mr. Li.

389
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,370
Seriously...

390
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,710
Let's go.

391
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,070
Next time,

392
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,520
just ask Long or someone else

393
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,130
to come up and call for me.

394
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,430
Don't come up here alone again.

395
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,710
Also,

396
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,420
your sweet potatoes

397
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,680
are really delicious.

398
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,230
Shuang Hong and the others love them.

399
00:26:59,230 --> 00:26:59,910
But

400
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,790
don't give us more next time.

401
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:02,810
Otherwise,

402
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,970
I won't treat you anymore.

403
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,270
Okay.

404
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,420
My son

405
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,950
who passed the exam

406
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,110
sent me a letter.

407
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,830
How is he?

408
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,950
It's been a long time since you saw him, right?

409
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,990
Yes.

410
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,880
It's been three years.

411
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,510
He said

412
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,790
he was sent

413
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,830
to Qingling for work.

414
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,750
It's far away.

415
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,710
But in my heart,

416
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,230
I'm happy.

417
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,470
So happy.

418
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,530
Thank you so much.

419
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,880
If it weren't for the

420
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,560
funds you provided for him

421
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,300
to take the exam at the capital,

422
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,110
we wouldn't have...

423
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,440
I told you, it's a loan.

424
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,590
Yes, yes.

425
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,140
You said

426
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,480
your son went to

427
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,750
Qingling for work.

428
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,430
How is the weather there?

429
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,750
Cold.

430
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,790
Very cold.

431
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,750
It's extremely cold.

432
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,790
In his letter, he wrote that

433
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,830
there was a snowstorm that lasted for days

434
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,710
and even an avalanche.

435
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,150
Many people died.

436
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,710
Is your son alright?

437
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,230
He’s an official now,

438
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,270
so he must go to the scene to help.

439
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,430
I know him.

440
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,710
With his temper,

441
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,500
whenever something happens,

442
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,700
he will be the first one to rush forward.

443
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,790
I'm always

444
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,310
worried about him.

445
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,870
Don't worry.

446
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,670
He will surely come back safely.

447
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,710
Yes.

448
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,790
You're right.

449
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,990
He will surely come back safely.

450
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,850
Let's go.

451
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,870
Back to the Apothecary Valley.

452
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:06,000
♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

453
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,690
♫Plum blossoms are about to fall; I'll see you here♫

454
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,540
♫Why are you late and why is it about to snow again?♫

455
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,770
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

456
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,880
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

457
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:40,090
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

458
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,940
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

459
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:17,920
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

460
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:24,990
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

461
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:31,920
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

462
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,320
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

463
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,750
Chief.

464
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,550
Did anyone enter the valley?

465
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,670
No.

466
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,390
Huo Zhanbai?

467
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,920
Huo Zhanbai?

468
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,710
Chief.

469
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,430
My eyes...

470
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,790
My eyes!

471
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,190
I can't see!

472
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,150
I can't see!

473
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,790
Calm down.

474
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,180
Calm down.

475
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,880
This is snow blindness.

476
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,670
It’s just temporary.

477
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,870
Chief Xue.

478
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,430
I…

479
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,360
I thought you were

480
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,490
planning to tease me

481
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,350
and tell me I'd be blind forever.

482
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,110
So...

483
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,750
I was playing along.

484
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,110
Looks like

485
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,910
you not only hurt your eyes

486
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,350
but also your head.

487
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,690
By the way, Chief Xue.

488
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,560
Planning to ask how long it'll take

489
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,090
for you to recover and go herb-seeking again?

490
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,250
I just wanted to ask

491
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,630
what day it is today.

492
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,630
After getting the Snow Poppy,

493
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,830
I fainted on the horse

494
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,800
and don't remember anything else.

495
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,790
It's the seventh day of the first month.

496
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,650
It's already the first month?

497
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,950
Now that I think about it,

498
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,350
I have to thank your horse

499
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,110
for knowing the way back to the Apothecary Valley.

500
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,280
Without it,

501
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,030
I would have died on the way.

502
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,150
By the way, Chief Xue.

503
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,710
I left the Snow Poppy on the horse.

504
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,510
Did you see it?

505
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,150
Shuang Hong and the others

506
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,670
have put it in the ice cave.

507
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,430
Okay.

508
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,200
That's good.

509
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,240
That's good.

510
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,690
I heard there was an avalanche

511
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,100
in Qingling.

512
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,870
Good thing I'm good at martial arts

513
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,330
and the flying technique.

514
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,700
I rushed down the mountain in time.

515
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,220
See?

516
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,950
I'm completely fine.

517
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,340
I think it's all because of luck.

518
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,070
Luck is a part

519
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,010
of one's capability as well.

520
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,210
What about next time?

521
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,920
Will you be so lucky next time?

522
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,570
Can't you hope the best for me?

523
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,520
Stop looking for the herbs.

524
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,550
Why?

525
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,510
Have you found another way

526
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,800
to cure Mo?

527
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,390
No.

528
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,410
Then...

529
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,820
I told you before that

530
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,590
I cannot confirm

531
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,590
the effectiveness

532
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,790
of the prescription.

533
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,310
You're risking

534
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,230
your life

535
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,790
for an uncertain prescription.

536
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,080
♫As the wind blows and the snow falls, the scent of plum blossoms sighs♫

537
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,240
What if one day

538
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,750
you really lose your life?

539
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,980
♫You nestle close, your whisper slow and tender♫

540
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,760
No matter what,

541
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:20,130
♫In the shadow, the stories of the heart remain untold♫

542
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,230
as long as I'm alive,

543
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,590
I can rush back to the Apothecary Valley.

544
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,520
I trust that you,

545
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:18,830
Chief Xue,

546
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,470
can drag my life

547
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,950
back from hell, can't you?

548
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,070
♫The bright moon in clouds reminds me of yesteryear♫

549
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,400
♫Drifting like smoke, I journey into the long night♫

550
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:38,370
♫In so deep, I'm trapped in the whirlpool of fate♫

551
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,270
Chief Xue?

552
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,870
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

553
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,390
I'm sorry.

554
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,890
I thought you left.

555
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,150
♫Following your direction, together we tread this path♫

556
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,420
♫Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hate♫

557
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,190
Is something bothering you, Chief Xue?

558
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,050
You can tell me.

559
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,190
Yes.

560
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,710
I think you're planning to

561
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:01,520
♫Eyes reddened, love etched on the heart♫

562
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,170
become a freeloader here.

563
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,230
Although your previous debt

564
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,230
has been settled,

565
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,870
I just

566
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,930
saved you again.

567
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,020
Judging from what you said just now,

568
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,710
you want me to save you a few more times.

569
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,440
The price is 100,000 per visit.

570
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,230
Are you really going to pay back with your body?

571
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,670
My ear suddenly

572
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,720
can't hear anything.

573
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,650
What’s going on?

574
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,730
Please show mercy, Chief Xue.

575
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,790
Please show mercy.

576
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,590
Your temporary blindness

577
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,650
needs three months

578
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,150
to recover.

579
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,010
After that,

580
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,680
I will come to give you a massage every day

581
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,810
with medicinal wine

582
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,660
to boost blood circulation and disperse clots.

583
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,630
It takes three months?

584
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,790
I guess my injury this time

585
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,950
isn't just temporary blindness.

586
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,550
Of course.

587
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,590
Although your blindness is temporary,

588
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,230
your head injury

589
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,990
is caused by blood stasis in your head.

590
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,030
If you can't wait,

591
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,720
there is also a fast way.

592
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,750
I can use acupuncture to forcibly

593
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,810
restore your sight

594
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,510
and temporarily

595
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,150
suppress the blood stasis in your head.

596
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,470
But after you recover,

597
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,550
if you fight again

598
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,190
during your herb search

599
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,220
and receives a concussion,

600
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,990
the blood stasis in your head can move at any time.

601
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,950
If you're lucky, you'll be blind forever.

602
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,190
If not, you will die.
