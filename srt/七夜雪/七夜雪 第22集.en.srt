4
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,750
Look at me.

5
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,210
Do you really want to save him that badly?

6
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,990
Yes.

7
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,740
Although he is your brother,

8
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,630
he...

9
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,290
I'm afraid that after he wakes up,

10
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,420
he might turn on you.

11
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,270
He'll hurt you,

12
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,870
you know?

13
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,490
I'm not afraid.

14
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,710
It seems

15
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,090
we can't convince each other.

16
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,310
You should go.

17
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,710
I'll do it.

18
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,350
Do what?

19
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
To remove the third needle from him.

20
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,710
You know about it?

21
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,070
Yes.

22
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,470
But...

23
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,000
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

24
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,329
Because...

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,750
I trust you.

26
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,750
Listen.

27
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,110
I'm doing this for Xue Ziye.

28
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,150
If you kill again in the future,

29
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,590
I will not let you go.

30
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,730
Let's do it.

31
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,350
Let go of me!

32
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,800
I could use all my strength

33
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,320
to end this quickly,

34
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,310
But I'm worried he might struggle violently

35
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,040
and hurt you.

36
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,390
Just do it.

37
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,760
Mingjie!

38
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,870
Mingjie, hang in there.

39
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,730
It'll end soon.

40
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,750
Hang in there.

41
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,990
I'm here.

42
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,050
It'll end soon!

43
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,310
Mingjie!

44
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,940
It'll end soon.

45
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,360
You'll be fine soon.

46
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,230
Hang in there.

47
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,270
Let go of me!

48
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,470
Little monster,

49
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,630
do you want to die?

50
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,190
How dare you!

51
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,330
The last time he killed,

52
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,630
we barely managed to cover it up.

53
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,110
But this time, he killed someone from our village.

54
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,150
What should we do?

55
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,830
Yes.

56
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,190
He's a murderous monster.

57
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,310
He's a demon child!

58
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,680
Yes, he is a demon child!

59
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,390
Everyone, stop it.

60
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,000
Actually,

61
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,500
he's just a child.

62
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,580
Last time, he killed

63
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,230
because he had no choice.

64
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,940
But now,

65
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,350
he kills as he pleases.

66
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:40,930
Well...

67
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,030
What should we do?

68
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,830
Chief,

69
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,909
you can't be soft-hearted anymore.

70
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,070
This demon child

71
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,610
will...

72
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,250
will drag the entire village down to hell.

73
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,530
That's right!

74
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,000
We must gouge out his eyes

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,950
to prevent future threats!

76
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,460
Don't gouge out his eyes!

77
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,890
Don't gouge out my eyes!

78
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,710
Don't gouge out my eyes!

79
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,650
Ye!

80
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,190
Grandpa,

81
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,150
please don't gouge out

82
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,920
Mingjie's eyes.

83
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
He's not a bad person!

84
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,870
Please don't take his eyes!

85
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,620
-Don't take his eyes!
-Grandpa!

86
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,220
You can't take his eyes!

87
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,150
Xuehuai,

88
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,090
the adults are talking here. It's none of your business!

89
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,320
Grandpa, don't take his eyes!

90
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,890
Grandpa!

91
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,190
Ye!

92
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,830
Matters of our Mo Family Village

93
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,090
are not for outsiders to interfere with!

94
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,870
Three days later,

95
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,770
we'll hold a village meeting.

96
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,830
Take him away.

97
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,510
Come with us!

98
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,790
Move!

99
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,250
Sister!

100
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,190
Move!

101
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,630
Move!

102
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,160
Mingjie!

103
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,830
Sister!

104
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,150
Mingjie!

105
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,070
Let go of me!

106
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,600
Let go of me!

107
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,950
Don't tie me up.

108
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,510
Don't take my eyes.

109
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,150
Please let me go!

110
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,960
I don't want to be locked up!

111
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,870
Please don't take my eyes!

112
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,550
Unlock the chains!

113
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,590
Don't take my eyes!

114
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,830
Please don't take my eyes!

115
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,620
Unlock the chains!

116
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,310
Unlock the chains!

117
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,910
Just leave.

118
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,730
Stop looking.

119
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,840
Mingjie!

120
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,520
Mingjie!

121
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,350
Those damn adults said

122
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,630
your eyes can kill.

123
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,650
But why is it that when I look at them, nothing happens to me?

124
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,310
Mingjie,

125
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,350
you were locked up because of me.

126
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,390
I've already talked to Xuehuai.

127
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,030
If...

128
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,480
If they really

129
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,340
take your eyes,

130
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,290
we'll each gouge out one of our own to give to you.

131
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,390
Mingjie, don't be afraid.

132
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,110
Mingjie.

133
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,860
Mingjie, come here.

134
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,790
Come to me.

135
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,670
Mingjie,

136
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,320
don't worry.

137
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,390
I won't let them

138
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,190
hurt you.

139
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,390
Give me your hand.

140
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,870
Trust me.

141
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,990
Sister Ye.

142
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,640
Do you want to go out?

143
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
These despicable fools

144
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,000
don't understand your power.

145
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:46,880
Only I

146
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,840
can awaken

147
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,990
your real power.

148
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,880
Do you want to go with me?

149
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,350
I want to go out.

150
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,870
I want to go out.

151
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,350
Okay.

152
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,550
I'll take you out.

153
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,990
But

154
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,750
you must submit to me

155
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,950
and become my Eye.

156
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,160
Are you willing?

157
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,310
Or...

158
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,560
would you rather continue to be despised,

159
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,670
imprisoned,

160
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,370
have your eyes gouged out,

161
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,350
and live in darkness for the rest of your life?

162
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,570
I want to go out.

163
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,070
As long as you take me out.

164
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,390
Okay.

165
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,350
Sister Ye!

166
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,190
Xuehuai!

167
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,070
Don't abandon me!

168
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,030
Sister!

169
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,790
Sister Ye!

170
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,320
See?

171
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,380
They don't care about you at all.

172
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,760
They abandoned you.

173
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,070
Chief,

174
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,470
let me take care of Mr. Mingjie.

175
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,950
As soon as he wakes up,

176
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,950
I'll let you know.

177
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,470
Go back and get some rest,

178
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,990
okay?

179
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,190
I want to wait for him to wake up.

180
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,350
Mingjie.

181
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,910
Mingjie,

182
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,640
are you feeling alright?

183
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,700
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

184
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,450
Does your head still hurt?

185
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,930
I will cure you.

186
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,710
You've been asleep for so long.

187
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,770
You must be hungry.

188
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,870
The yellow rice cakes and food

189
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,950
have gotten a bit cold.

190
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,220
I'll warm them up for you.

191
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,350
It'll be ready soon.

192
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,470
Sister Ye.

193
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,160
What did you call me?

194
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,910
Say it again.

195
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,620
Sister...

196
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,110
Ye.

197
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,030
You remember?

198
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,790
You remember now!

199
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,070
Great!

200
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,590
That's great!

201
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,000
Look at me.

202
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,670
I...

203
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,630
Why am I crying?

204
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,470
I should be happy.

205
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,590
I had a dream.

206
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,030
I dreamt

207
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,830
that I killed all my companions.

208
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,230
I was just Chang Wujue's dog,

209
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,470
so I survived.

210
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,610
For over ten years,

211
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,990
I had no past,

212
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,590
no future,

213
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,230
and no connection to this world.

214
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,550
I never imagined

215
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,130
that you've been through so much.

216
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,310
Being alone all these years

217
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,520
must have been hard for you.

218
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,870
Mingjie,

219
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,910
now that you're back,

220
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,270
I've always wanted

221
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,790
to say sorry to you.

222
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,590
Back then,

223
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,630
that night,

224
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,470
I didn't make it back in time to save you.

225
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,380
It was my fault

226
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,150
that you had to suffer so much.

227
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,340
You were only six years old and were locked up

228
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,070
in that dark room because of me.

229
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,020
I always treated you

230
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,430
like my own brother.

231
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,470
I also swore

232
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,070
I would always be good to you.

233
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,190
But I...

234
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,060
I failed to keep that promise.

235
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,180
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,920
It was all my fault.

237
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,030
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,620
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,990
I know.

240
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,540
I know you didn't mean it.

241
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,670
Back then,

242
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,960
I failed to protect you.

243
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,710
But from now on,

244
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,230
no matter what happens,

245
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,990
I will face it with you

246
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,520
and bear it together.

247
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,750
I won't let you

248
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,210
go back to that dark place.

249
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,330
From now on,

250
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,410
you can stay in the valley

251
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,750
and do whatever you like,

252
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,720
as long as you're happy.

253
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,950
Is that okay?

254
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,430
But I killed too many people.

255
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,450
You were controlled because of the golden needles

256
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,410
in your head.

257
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,750
Killing wasn't your intention.

258
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,990
But their blood

259
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,589
is on my hands.

260
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,510
What has happened

261
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,869
cannot be undone.

262
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,470
As long as you are willing to turn back,

263
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,869
it's never too late.

264
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,510
I will be with you

265
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,550
as we atone for the mistakes of the past.

266
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,030
It was he who helped me

267
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,240
remove the golden needles for you.

268
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,390
Thank you.

269
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,580
You've been fighting for years,

270
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,420
leaving many old injuries

271
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,100
and hidden illnesses on your body,

272
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,190
which need to be taken care of properly.

273
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,250
Especially your chronic headaches.

274
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,190
The golden needles were in your brain for many years,

275
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,920
and your brain is very fragile.

276
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,260
Combined with the forced use of the Eye Magic,

277
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,790
you often experience unbearable headaches.

278
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,400
Your eyes can also trigger these headaches?

279
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,590
Why were your eyes

280
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,920
frequently irritated?

281
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,290
Because of the failed missions.

282
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,790
Every time I failed,

283
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,280
Chang Wujue locked me in a dog cage,

284
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,370
fed me raw meat,

285
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,400
and made me crawl like a dog.

286
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,680
Sometimes, he even forced me to stare directly at the sun

287
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,340
until I started hallucinating.

288
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,630
Mingjie,

289
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,720
I will definitely cure

290
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,600
your headaches

291
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,480
and free you from all those pains forever.

292
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,390
I will use moxibustion

293
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,650
to warm and stimulate the meridians around your eyes.

294
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,730
Then, step by step,

295
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,200
I'll try to clear

296
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,790
the blocked channels in your brain.

297
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,030
Tell me immediately

298
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,000
if you feel any discomfort.

299
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,980
Are you feeling alright?

300
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,630
Is there any discomfort?

301
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,140
Don't be afraid.

302
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,020
I'm here.

303
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,350
Relax.

304
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,140
Relax.

305
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,340
It's okay.

306
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,380
Close your eyes.

307
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,710
Good.

308
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,640
After that catastrophe,

309
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,110
my master took me

310
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,570
back to Mo Family Village,

311
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,470
where we collected the remains

312
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,750
of every villager

313
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,220
and buried them there.

314
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,790
Because of my cold disease,

315
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,990
I couldn't stay out of the valley for too long,

316
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,630
so

317
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,990
we built cenotaphs here.

318
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,760
Every year, during the festivals,

319
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,670
I come here to pay my respects.

320
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,750
Mingjie,

321
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,950
do you still remember them?

322
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,950
In the past,

323
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,650
I always made Chief angry.

324
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,710
He chased me

325
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,590
all around the village every few days.

326
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,110
Yes.

327
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,330
Xuehuai mentioned this to me before,

328
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,170
saying you were the naughtiest one

329
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,370
in the village.

330
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,880
always playing tricks on the chief.

331
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,970
Back then, the villagers

332
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,230
must not have liked me.

333
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,750
Why do you think so?

334
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,150
Because

335
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,410
I always caused trouble

336
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,270
in the village.

337
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,150
Actually,

338
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,150
they just saw you

339
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,170
as a playful and mischievous child.

340
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,550
Even after you went to the small wooden house,

341
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,430
the folks

342
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,890
often asked Xuehuai and me

343
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,630
how Mingjie was doing.

344
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,110
They asked about me only because

345
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,370
they were afraid of me.

346
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,990
Do you remember

347
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,230
when you were little,

348
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,290
you loved yellow rice cakes the most?

349
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,040
Every time

350
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,270
I brought them to you,

351
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,990
you would

352
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,290
stare straight at them

353
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,360
and almost start drooling.

354
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,750
However,

355
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,950
you always held back

356
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,350
and gave me the first bite.

357
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,510
Back then,

358
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,240
it was so cold,

359
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,670
but the yellow rice cakes were warm.

360
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,020
Back then,

361
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,070
life felt very hard for me.

362
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,050
But I always remember

363
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,670
that the first bites of the yellow rice cake were sweet.

364
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,360
Mingjie.

365
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,160
Mingjie!

366
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,790
Sister Ye, you're here.

367
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,520
Mingjie,

368
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,510
guess what delicious food

369
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,310
I brought you?

370
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,290
Yellow rice cakes?

371
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,970
They're from Ms. Guo.

372
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,630
I heard from Xuehuai

373
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,590
that you love yellow rice cakes the most.

374
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,120
Eat them while they're hot.

375
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,170
Sister, you eat first.

376
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,910
I brought them specially for you.

377
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,710
You eat first.

378
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,990
No, Sister.

379
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,610
I'll eat after you finish.

380
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,270
Okay, I'll eat first.

381
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,210
Actually, those yellow rice cakes

382
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,770
were specially made for you

383
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,850
by the folks.

384
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,350
If they really

385
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,400
didn't like you,

386
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,630
then why did they secretly

387
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,590
slip them into my pockets every time

388
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,910
for me to bring to you?

389
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,730
I'm glad you're alive.

390
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,840
That's good enough.

391
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,410
Today, I'll have some people

392
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,670
remove this cenotaph.

393
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,320
[My Brother, Wu Mingjie]
[His Sister, Xue Ziye]

394
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,950
Keep it here.

395
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,640
Let it keep the villagers company.

396
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,670
After all, they went through this

397
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,840
because of me.

398
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,920
But I was the one who least deserved

399
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,110
to survive.

400
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,530
You didn't do anything wrong.

401
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,340
The destruction of the village wasn't your fault.

402
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,400
But those villains

403
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,790
came to Mo Family Village

404
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,190
because of the Eye Magic.

405
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,040
And the Eye Magic is part of me.

406
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,320
Maybe the things

407
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,890
I've gone through all these years

408
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,140
are what I'm destined to endure.

409
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,150
No one is destined

410
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,300
to endure anything.

411
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,720
Mingjie,

412
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,960
I also used to want to

413
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,590
uncover the truth of the past

414
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,670
and seek justice for the villagers.

415
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,550
Gradually,

416
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,990
it became an obsession

417
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,750
that consumed all my energy.

418
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,550
Before, that obsession was like a crutch,

419
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,510
supporting me.

420
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,230
But it wasn't until later,

421
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,630
when I nearly lost someone important to me,

422
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,670
that I realized

423
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,960
if you rely too heavily on that crutch,

424
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,070
one day

425
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,040
you'll forget how to walk.

426
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,550
That crutch

427
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,230
will then become chains,

428
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,820
trapping you

429
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,430
in the past forever.

430
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,910
Since you survived,

431
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,950
just live well.

432
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,510
Let the past

433
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,230
be the past.

434
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,580
I know

435
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,930
it might take some time.

436
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,350
I'll be with you.

437
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,480
You two just reunited.

438
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,590
Shouldn't you be having a long, heartfelt conversation?

439
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,560
Why are you here?

440
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,710
In Apothecary Valley,

441
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,910
I can go wherever I want.

442
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,260
If you want to drink with me,

443
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,200
just say it.

444
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,310
Don't flatter yourself.

445
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,080
I do want to drink,

446
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,490
but not with you.

447
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,650
Well,

448
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,360
since it's just me here,

449
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,550
you'll have to settle

450
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,750
for drinking with me.

451
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,740
Although the golden needles have been removed,

452
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,080
Eye, the assassin from the past,

453
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,090
may not have died.

454
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,830
Are you really confident

455
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,360
that you can warm his heart?

456
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,390
Isolating himself from people

457
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,870
and not knowing

458
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,220
how to respond to normal feelings—

459
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,460
these are wounds left

460
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,740
by his past.

461
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,270
He hasn't even recovered

462
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,360
from the needle marks on his head,

463
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,030
let alone

464
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,360
the wounds in his heart.

465
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,070
He is not just my brother now;

466
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,660
he is also my patient.

467
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,910
I will do everything I can to heal him,

468
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,100
slowly but surely.

469
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,580
Besides...

470
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,350
Besides?

471
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,630
Besides,

472
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,790
I also need this time

473
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,630
to get used to facing a brother

474
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,430
who is completely different

475
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,760
from the one in my memory

476
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,580
and to find a new way

477
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,000
to get along with him.

478
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,480
Since you've thought it through,

479
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,030
I won't

480
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,990
go against you anymore.

481
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,150
However,

482
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,300
during this time, your safety

483
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,500
will be my responsibility.

484
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,610
Thank you.

485
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,960
Don't you think

486
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,250
you've thanked me a bit too often lately?

487
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,110
Well, I owe you.

488
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,110
If anything, I'm the one who owes you.

489
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,150
In that case,

490
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,140
let's call it even.

491
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,020
We're even.

492
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,350
Aren't you going to have a cup of Laughing at the World?

493
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,150
Sister Ye,

494
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,010
I can't turn back.

495
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,870
How is it?

496
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,270
I haven't got the Dragon Blood Pearl yet.

497
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,870
Miao Huo,

498
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,330
you came early.

499
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,030
It's not that I came early;

500
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,090
it's that you took too long to return.

501
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,830
What have you been doing

502
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,690
in this valley?

503
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,310
Are you going to learn medicine?

504
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,710
Are you gathering herbs?

505
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,670
With your usual style,

506
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,420
you should have just

507
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,730
killed everyone in the valley

508
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,060
and snatched the Dragon Blood Pearl back.

509
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,990
What's wrong?

510
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,910
Are you feeling soft-hearted this time?

511
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,240
No.

512
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,190
Huo Zhanbai is here,

513
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,480
so it's a bit tricky.

514
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,670
Damn it.

515
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,710
That troublesome guy again.

516
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,920
What happened to the twelve silver wings you brought?

517
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,320
They were all killed by him?

518
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,070
I'll make him pay for it.

519
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,710
Don't worry about him for now.

520
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,530
The most important thing now

521
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,840
is to get the Dragon Blood Pearl.

522
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,770
After we kill the Doctrine Leader,

523
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,750
we'll have plenty of time to deal with Huo Zhanbai.

524
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,750
I'm just reminding you.

525
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,910
We've been out

526
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,610
for a month and a half already.

527
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,830
The Doctrine Leader's seclusion

528
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,960
is about to end soon.

529
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,300
Miao Shui sent news saying that

530
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,800
the Doctrine Leader asked about you.

531
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,350
The Doctrine Leader is coming out of seclusion?

532
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,210
Did he find out?

533
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,990
No.

534
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,560
Miao Shui was on duty.

535
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,820
She answered

536
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,030
according to the plan

537
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,300
we prepared,

538
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,110
saying

539
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,750
you went to Mount Changbai's

540
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,230
Skypool

541
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,550
to assassinate the Skypool Hermit.

542
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,950
The Doctrine Leader has a grudge against him.

543
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,440
Upon hearing that you were going to kill him,

544
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,510
he seemed rather satisfied.

545
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,570
What a foolish pig.

546
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,560
That's good.

547
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,970
Not really.

548
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,630
You need to hurry.

549
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,010
I feel something is off

550
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,670
this time.

551
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,790
What's wrong?

552
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,590
In the past,

553
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,910
when the Doctrine Leader was in seclusion,

554
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,640
he would occasionally summon Miao Shui at night.

555
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,040
It can be considered a way to recuperate.

556
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,830
This time, he didn't see her.

557
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,110
He only saw Miao Feng.

558
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,510
Everyone is starting to suspect

559
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,660
that something went wrong

560
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,860
with this seclusion.

561
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,950
All factions are probing for information.

562
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,780
Within the sect, there are both open and covert conflicts and rivalries.

563
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,670
The Third Saintess

564
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,910
can't hold back any longer.

565
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm afraid she might take action soon.

566
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,460
We have to hurry up.

567
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,150
If the Doctrine Leader really

568
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,230
notices something wrong,

569
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,930
he'll send people over

570
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,260
to flatten this valley.

571
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,790
I see.

572
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,620
I'll be quick.

573
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,550
Don't be soft-hearted anymore.

574
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,310
Hurry up.

575
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,750
This...

576
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,140
This is...

577
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,550
Xuehuai?

578
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,070
Mingjie.

579
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,070
Sister Ye?

580
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,420
Why are you here?

581
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,900
I was just curious.

582
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes.

583
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,270
I should have brought you over

584
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,929
to see Xuehuai a long time ago.

585
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,670
Why did he become like this?

586
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,830
To save me.

587
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,550
Mingjie,

588
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,110
if Xuehuai knew that

589
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:47,960
you are alive

590
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,070
in this world,

591
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,020
he would be extremely happy.

592
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,110
And you wouldn't have to

593
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,750
watch me and Xuehuai play together

594
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,500
and set off fireworks in the small wooden house anymore.

595
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,340
The three of us

596
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,550
would live together happily

597
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,510
and never be apart.

598
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,110
Right,

599
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,280
Xuehuai?

600
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,990
Sister,

601
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,160
please give me the Dragon Blood Pearl.

602
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,350
What do you need the Dragon Blood Pearl for?

603
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,230
Are you going to take it back

604
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,090
to Chang Wujue?

605
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,590
Yes.

606
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,850
Are you going back to Kunlun?

607
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:38,830
No.

608
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,100
In this mission,

609
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,360
Chang Wujue assigned Miao Huo and me

610
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,360
to retrieve the Dragon Blood Pearl.

611
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,190
If we don't bring it back,

612
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,950
Miao Huo will die.

613
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,790
I can forgo returning to Yuan Yi Palace.

614
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,310
Sister,

615
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,120
please give me the Dragon Blood Pearl.

616
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,570
I will rush to the capital

617
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,980
and give it to Miao Huo,

618
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,360
and then I'll come back.

619
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,990
But the Dragon Blood Pearl

620
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,920
was found by Huo Zhanbai.

621
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,070
If you find it difficult,

622
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,520
I can think of another way myself.

623
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,860
Even without the mission for the Dragon Blood Pearl,

624
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,710
if Chang Wujue finds that I have delayed

625
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,270
returning to Yuan Yi Palace,

626
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,330
he will look for me.

627
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,430
At that point, the Apothecary Valley will be implicated,

628
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,890
and that would not be good.

629
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,050
It's my oversight.

630
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,630
There should indeed be a contingency plan.

631
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
He may have already made a decision.

632
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,590
Mingjie

633
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,320
did not come back eventually.

634
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,230
Tomorrow,

635
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,830
if I still can't obtain the Dragon Blood Pearl,

636
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,220
I will have to use force.

637
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,230
Mingjie,

638
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,810
are you asleep?

639
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,670
Not yet.

640
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,700
Can I come in?

641
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,390
Come in.

642
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,810
The yellow rice cakes are cold, and you haven't eaten them.

643
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,520
You don't like

644
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,780
yellow rice cakes now?

645
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,850
They're too sweet.

646
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,910
Well, what do you like to eat?

647
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,760
I can have Shuang Hong and the others make it.

648
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,290
If you have anything to say,

649
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,750
just say it.

650
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,300
On the way here just now,

651
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,810
I thought about it.

652
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,790
The safest way

653
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,240
is for you to send

654
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,960
the Dragon Blood Pearl to the capital.

655
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,650
Don't you have difficulties?

656
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,470
Why are you suddenly

657
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,070
willing to give me the pearl?

658
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,910
This trip

659
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,270
will not just be about escorting the pearl.

660
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,790
As you said,

661
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,470
if you don't return to Yuan Yi Palace for a long time,

662
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,500
Chang Wujue will definitely become suspicious.

663
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,380
You must

664
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,190
get past this hurdle.

665
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,170
I want you to use the opportunity

666
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,500
of delivering the pearl

667
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,070
to stage a fake death.

668
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,790
Only when Chang Wujue believes

669
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,070
you are really dead

670
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,240
will he stop searching for you.

671
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,880
That way, you can finally gain true freedom.

672
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,290
However,

673
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,750
you will also lose your identity

674
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,790
as Eye forever.

675
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,090
Are you willing?

676
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,950
Of course.

677
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,470
Alright.

678
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,190
In that case,

679
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,310
tomorrow,

680
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,170
I'll give you the Dragon Blood Pearl.

681
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,320
Be careful while escorting it.

682
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,370
Thank you, Sister.

683
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,710
I'll go back now.

684
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,570
You should rest early.

685
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,790
Sister Ye,

686
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,090
I'm here.

687
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,840
Come in.

688
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,870
You're here.

689
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,700
The Dragon Blood Pearl is on the table.

690
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,030
Go get it yourself.

691
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,500
Thank you, Sister Ye.

692
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,380
I'll be back shortly.

693
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,890
You won't leave for Kunlun

694
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,940
and never return, right?

695
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,900
Of course not.

696
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,940
Don't worry, Sister Ye.

697
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,590
Mingjie.

698
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,760
Mingjie!

699
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,150
I haven't told you

700
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,410
how to fake your death,

701
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,190
and you're just going to leave like this?

702
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,010
I have already sealed

703
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,410
your Ren and Du meridians

704
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,380
with needles laced with anesthetic powder.

705
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,260
You can't move

706
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,380
or use any martial arts.

707
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,230
Sister Ye,

708
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,990
what are you doing?

709
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,150
Mingjie,

710
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,710
there's no need to pretend anymore.

711
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,160
I know you won't return

712
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,110
this time.

713
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,770
It was also a lie that you need the Dragon Blood Pearl

714
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,130
to save Miao Huo, right?

715
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,110
It seems

716
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,100
you don't trust me anymore.

717
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,790
Mingjie,

718
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,230
you've suffered so much torment

719
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,550
in Yuan Yi Palace.

720
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,480
Why do you still want to go back?

721
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,840
Chang Wujue only sees you

722
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,200
as a tool for killing.

723
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,910
Why do you want to put yourself in danger

724
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,040
for the person who's been harming you?

725
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,550
Do you know that there's a high possibility

726
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,010
that he is the main culprit

727
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,130
behind the massacre of Mo Family Village back then?

728
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,050
Mo Family Village had nothing to do with me.

729
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,980
Its destruction

730
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,830
was also none of my business.

731
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,390
Also,

732
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,180
don't call me Mingjie anymore.

733
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,390
I'm not Mingjie.

734
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,570
No matter what you say,

735
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,110
I will not let you

736
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,010
return to Yuan Yi Palace, that den of demons, today.

737
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,230
Trust me.

738
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,420
I can't trust you.

739
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,570
I only trust myself.

740
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,210
Is your chief in the room?

741
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,510
She is

742
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,390
resting inside now.
