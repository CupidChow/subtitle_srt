00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,760
[Episode 28]

4
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,289
Out of the Seven Swords of the Sword Sect,

5
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,550
I am only missing Fifth Brother's

6
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,430
reply letter.

7
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,270
He must be indecisive

8
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,630
because of me and Bao.

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,190
If you have time,

10
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,510
go see him in person.

11
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,750
Although Mr. Dashing has retired from the martial world,

12
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,750
his heart

13
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,190
has never forgotten the martial world.

14
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,960
I understand.

15
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,550
A few years ago,

16
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,070
I heard Fengxing

17
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,270
praise you before.

18
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,590
He said you're loyal

19
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,750
and courageous.

20
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,190
After what happened,

21
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,710
although you're thousands of miles apart from them,

22
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,110
you still managed to strategize

23
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,770
and handled everything well.

24
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,920
At the same time, you were taking care of Mrs. Qiushui.

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,430
You're indeed the best candidate

26
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,960
for the Sword Sect's chief.

27
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,970
You flatter me.

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,710
During this time,

29
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,870
without you,

30
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,660
I couldn't

31
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,910
have done it on my own.

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
Now, Mrs. Qiushui

33
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,750
has almost recovered.

34
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,300
After she completes her medication,

35
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,220
I will leave.

36
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,740
Thank you

37
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,030
for your care these days.

38
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,890
No need to thank me.

39
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,950
This is my promise to Ziye.

40
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,590
I won't break my promise.

41
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,530
Speaking of which,

42
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,750
it's been a while since Snow Harrier delivered the letter.

43
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,280
Why hasn't it come back yet?

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,700
I was thinking of

45
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,430
seeing her as soon as possible.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,390
But now,

47
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,510
the plan to eliminate Yuan Yi Palace

48
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,570
cannot be delayed.

49
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,270
I have to go.

50
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,150
You will reunite eventually.

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,170
We'll definitely reunite.

52
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,590
She's still waiting for me

53
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,720
to drink together under the plum tree.

54
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,630
Bye.

55
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,510
Seven.

56
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,680
Fourth Brother.

57
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,010
How is it going?

58
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,810
All's good.

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,810
I have to admit that

60
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,870
you predicted every move perfectly.

61
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,090
Where's Chief?

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,360
He's waiting for you.

63
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,920
Let's go

64
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,409
inside.

65
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,950
Okay.

66
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,790
Chief.

67
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,150
I'm here to apologize to you.

68
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,030
Apologize?

69
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,620
For what?

70
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,560
I summoned the Seven Swords

71
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,110
to deal with Yuan Yi Palace

72
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,510
without asking for your permission first.

73
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,990
Therefore, I apologize.

74
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,630
Are you here to receive

75
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,010
a punishment or a reward?

76
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,390
On your feet.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,720
You did a great job

78
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,550
dealing with the Yuan Yi Palace.

79
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,050
I just want to know

80
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,190
what your next plan is.

81
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,110
Making use of the internal conflict in Yuan Yi Palace,

82
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,330
we'll gather the Seven Swords,

83
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,590
travel to West Kunlun,

84
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,470
kill Chang Wujue,

85
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,360
and destroy Yuan Yi Palace.

86
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,550
For the martial world

87
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,090
and also for the...

88
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,710
Now is the best time to strike.

89
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,390
Indeed.

90
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,070
Now is the best time.

91
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,230
Follow me.

92
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,830
Look at this.

93
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,550
Eye rebelled?

94
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,230
No wonder he risked his life

95
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,960
to take the Dragon Blood Pearl.

96
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,470
I think he has long wanted to rebel

97
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,970
and needed it to poison Chang Wujue.

98
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,390
Here is a map.

99
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,730
This is Yuan Yi Palace.

100
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,430
This is

101
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,510
the entrance to Yuan Yi Palace.

102
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,190
Chief,

103
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,830
is the information and the map accurate?

104
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,790
Who sent it?

105
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,030
The source is very accurate.

106
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,240
The previous information about Qin Tiancheng

107
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,070
and Yuan Yi Palace abducting children

108
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,670
was also sent by this person.

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,030
As for their identity,

110
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,210
You'll know once you reach

111
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,390
Yuan Yi Palace.

112
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,390
Yes.

113
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,720
Now,

114
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,870
the Yuan Yi Palace is in chaos

115
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,030
and has been weakened unprecedentedly.

116
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,110
Zhanbai.

117
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,270
Summon the Seven Swords in three days

118
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,110
to go to West Kunlun immediately.

119
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,950
Take this opportunity

120
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,610
to annihilate Yuan Yi Palace.

121
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:05,930
Yes.

122
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,120
Fourth Brother.

123
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,270
There's no time to lose.

124
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,350
Let's gather the Seven Swords

125
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,750
and set out immediately.

126
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,150
More like Six Swords.

127
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,230
We don't know

128
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,560
where Five is at all.

129
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,870
How can we summon him?

130
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,190
Let's go to Yangzhou first.

131
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,550
Yangzhou?

132
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,430
Snow Harrier?

133
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,909
Your master has left.

134
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,520
[Chief has gone to Yuan Yi Palace in Kunlun. - Shuang Hong]

135
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,680
Chief has gone to Yuan Yi Palace in Kunlun.

136
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,860
She's crazy.

137
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,570
Why would she go to Kunlun with her weak body?

138
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,970
Does she have a death wish?

139
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,410
Chief Xue, please alight.

140
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,610
Are we here?

141
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,750
That's right.

142
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,230
I heard that Kunlun

143
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,560
is a sacred mountain in the west and

144
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
the Heavenly Queen Mother's residence.

145
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,980
It's like the abyss

146
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,170
or a land of the extreme north.

147
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,590
I heard that the sky there

148
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,030
has seven colors.

149
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,350
The ice surface

150
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,080
reflects the colors as if they are everchanging.

151
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,510
It's so beautiful, it's dreamy.

152
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,500
The Ice Silkworm Poison must be acting up again.

153
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,430
I'll perform acupuncture for you.

154
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,430
No need.

155
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,150
From now on,

156
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,990
you should rest well

157
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,430
to treat the Doctrine Leader later.

158
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,790
Did the Doctrine Leader

159
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,190
drug you with something?

160
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,590
I want to save you.

161
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,350
Why don't you take it seriously?

162
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,410
So you can still feel pain.

163
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,480
Let's go.

164
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,150
Hold on.

165
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,870
Where is Yuan Yi Palace?

166
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,430
Ya Mi, you...

167
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,210
We're here.

168
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,780
Did you really kill

169
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,710
that carriage driver?

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,270
You...

171
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,750
You killed him!

172
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,200
Why did you do that?

173
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,280
He was just

174
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,970
an ordinary carriage driver.

175
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,110
He came all the way here

176
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,270
to make a living.

177
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,460
How could you kill him?

178
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,390
You lunatic!

179
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,630
If not,

180
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,910
we can't guarantee that he won't reveal

181
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,840
the way to Yuan Yi Palace to others.

182
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,590
Besides,

183
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,570
I only promised to give him money.

184
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,630
I didn't promise not to kill him.

185
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,790
You lunatic.

186
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,830
Do you know

187
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,130
how much effort it costs me

188
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,650
to save a life?

189
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,160
But you took a life

190
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,590
just like that!

191
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,960
Are you still human?

192
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,790
I told you

193
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,990
you'd regret

194
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,990
saving me.

195
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,830
I am a murderer.

196
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,030
We're polar opposites.

197
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,430
Please

198
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,870
go to Yuan Yi Palace with me

199
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,330
to treat the Doctrine Leader.

200
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,310
I want to save you.

201
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,310
But what should I do

202
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,550
to cure you,

203
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,750
Ya Mi?

204
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,910
I’m fine.

205
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,890
Please don't bother.

206
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,050
Envoy Miao Feng.

207
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,390
You're finally back.

208
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,370
Doctrine Leader ordered

209
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,430
for you to report to

210
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,270
Yuan Yi Hall as soon as you're back.

211
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,730
What happened in the sect?

212
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,070
Something serious happened.

213
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,800
Sun Saintess and Eye rebelled.

214
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,790
How is the Doctrine Leader?

215
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,590
He is fine.

216
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,360
Go up

217
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,510
and get Chief Xue’s luggage.

218
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,910
Yes.

219
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,350
Envoy Miao Feng.

220
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,280
Envoy Miao Shui.

221
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,750
You're finally back.

222
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,390
The Doctrine Leader has been waiting for you.

223
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,550
I met the Eight Elites of the Asura Field on my way here

224
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,080
and was delayed for a while.

225
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,190
Are you injured?

226
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,350
Chief Xue.

227
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,470
We meet again

228
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,980
after our encounter at Longmen Village.

229
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,350
So cold, Chief Xue.

230
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,710
Envoy Miao Feng.

231
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,610
How strange.

232
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,870
Why has your smile

233
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,870
disappeared?

234
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,860
What a pity.

235
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,760
Who...

236
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,110
Took it away?

237
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,150
Let's go.

238
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,640
I want to see your Doctrine Leader.

239
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,790
[Yuan Yi Palace]

240
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,270
Feng.

241
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,260
Come in.

242
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,270
Are you Chief Xue?

243
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,200
Yes.

244
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,550
Feng.

245
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,120
You're back.

246
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,930
Greetings, Doctrine Leader.

247
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,270
My child.

248
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,030
As expected,

249
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,910
you brought her back on time.

250
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,550
I raised you well.

251
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,870
Get up.

252
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,070
Chief Xue.

253
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,250
Feng is a good boy.

254
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,990
He's obedient and sensible.

255
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,350
Unlike Eye.

256
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,630
Eye

257
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,020
is more like a venomous snake.

258
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,510
A venomous snake that is always

259
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,570
thinking of killing its benefactor.

260
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,210
When do you wish to start your treatment?

261
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,150
It seems that you're

262
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,670
more anxious than me.

263
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,590
You only have me as a doctor.

264
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,160
But you are not the only patient I have.

265
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,230
But only I

266
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,480
can let the Chief of the Apothecary Valley

267
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,810
travel here to treat me.

268
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,080
Chief Xue,

269
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,070
you should know that

270
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,530
the Yuan Yi Palace is an enemy to

271
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,730
the martial world of the Central Plains.

272
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,650
Why are you willing to

273
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,030
to treat me?

274
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,310
The Apothecary Valley

275
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,590
never gets involved in the affairs of the martial world.

276
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,070
As long as you have the Fate-Reversal Token and money to pay me,

277
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,350
why can’t I come?

278
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,030
Since you are here,

279
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
do me another favor.

280
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,850
Look at him.

281
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,880
Can he still be treated?

282
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,070
He can be saved

283
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,750
if you can afford it.

284
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,869
Chief Xue.

285
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,869
Please.

286
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,430
Chief Xue.

287
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,270
Chief Xue,

288
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,670
you're truly a kind healer.

289
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,110
Unfortunately,

290
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,790
Eye is a traitor who

291
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,430
tried to assassinate me.

292
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,530
It's only natural for me

293
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,680
to rid my place of traitors.

294
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,430
I’m afraid you’re used to

295
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,230
joking with your subordinates.

296
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,410
You're treating me like

297
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,870
a member of Yuan Yi Palace.

298
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,470
If you're not in a hurry to be treated,

299
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,310
please send me back

300
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,750
to the Apothecary Valley as soon as possible.

301
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,910
I have something to do.

302
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,190
Don’t worry.

303
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,000
I can start the treatment anytime.

304
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,430
Okay.

305
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,760
Don't save him.

306
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,260
He is a devil.

307
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,210
How dare he disrespect the Doctrine Leader?

308
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,990
Chief Xue,

309
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,550
I’m sorry for being so unsightly in front of

310
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,550
a distinguished guest like you.

311
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,230
Guards.

312
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,310
Drag this traitor

313
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,230
out of here.

314
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,820
Don't stain my palace.

315
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:40,990
Yes.

316
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,390
It's been a tiring trip

317
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,250
for me.

318
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,110
When can I rest?

319
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,990
Chief Xue,

320
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,710
aren’t you going to diagnose me first?

321
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,750
Doctors need to be observant.

322
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,470
Your voice

323
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,150
seems peaceful and calm,

324
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,190
but there's a bit of breathlessness.

325
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,060
I'm already 50% sure.

326
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,830
Okay.

327
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,590
I can leave after

328
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,270
I treat you, right?

329
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,870
Of course.

330
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,590
As long as I can

331
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,140
regain my previous health,

332
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,180
I’ll reward you handsomely

333
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,670
and get someone

334
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,270
to send you back

335
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,130
to the Apothecary Valley safely.

336
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,190
It's a deal.

337
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,630
Feng.

338
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,590
You stay.

339
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,390
Yes.

340
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,590
Chief Xue.

341
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,770
This way, please.

342
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,350
Doctrine Leader.

343
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,870
What took you so long?

344
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,230
On my way here,

345
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,490
I was ambushed by the Eight Elites sent by Eye.

346
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,890
That's why I was delayed.

347
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,870
What about the Eight Elites?

348
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,510
They all died on the snowfield.

349
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,870
Feng.

350
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,640
It's been tough for you.

351
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,400
On the way,

352
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,390
did your Ice Silkworm Poison

353
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,350
act up?

354
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,410
Chief Xue gave me acupuncture

355
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,270
to relieve the pain.

356
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,670
It seems

357
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,430
you and Chief Xue

358
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,270
went through a lot

359
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,500
on this journey.

360
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,630
I only focused on

361
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,870
bringing her back to Yuan Yi Palace safely.

362
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,710
Anything wrong with her?

363
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,190
I tested her.

364
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,390
She doesn't seem to know

365
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,920
about Eye's real identity.

366
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,510
She has no way to know

367
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,570
who massacred the village back then.

368
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,230
Indeed.

369
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,530
I tried several times just now.

370
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
But that woman

371
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,030
didn't react to Eye's situation

372
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,510
at all.

373
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,200
Why did you arrange for

374
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,510
Eye to meet Chief Xue?

375
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,510
This was a risky move.

376
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,230
I just wanted to see the sight

377
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,090
of loving siblings incapable

378
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,660
of recognizing each other.

379
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,200
If Xue Ziye knew

380
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,670
Eye was her brother from the Mo Family Village

381
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,800
how interesting would that have been?

382
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,030
Unfortunately.

383
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,030
Seven days later,

384
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,150
the poison of the Soul Devouring Powder

385
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,210
will penetrate the brain from the eye

386
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,530
and gradually consume his mind.

387
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,190
At that time,

388
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,960
she can only

389
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,990
watch him die.

390
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,710
When I recover,

391
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,160
I must let them

392
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,910
reunite

393
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,240
and be buried in Mount Kunlun forever.

394
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,710
I'll tell her before she dies.

395
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,780
Before that,

396
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,800
she’s still useful.

397
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,000
Chief Xue may be useful in the future.

398
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,900
Why don’t you spare her life?

399
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,660
Are you pleading for her?

400
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,930
My sincere apologies,

401
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,750
please spare her life.

402
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,790
Feng.

403
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,470
What are you doing?

404
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,710
How dare you speak for

405
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,570
someone who is unfavorable to me?

406
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,720
Since you came in,

407
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,680
I've noticed it.

408
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,590
Who took away

409
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,070
your smile?

410
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
That woman

411
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,730
broke your Spring Breeze Technique!

412
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,270
On the way,

413
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,870
Chief Xue saved me many times.

414
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,910
All this time,

415
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,320
besides you,

416
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,750
no one had

417
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,410
ever saved me.

418
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,640
I...

419
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,470
I...

420
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,830
I just don't want to see her die.

421
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:10,790
You...

422
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,670
Doctrine Leader!

423
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
I see.

424
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,190
I see.

425
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,110
Feng.

426
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,100
For the past 20 years,

427
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,790
this is the first time you've cared

428
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,590
about someone else's survival.

429
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,220
If I insist on killing her,

430
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,830
what would you do?

431
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,190
I...

432
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,960
I don't know

433
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,220
what I would do either.

434
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,170
How dare you talk to me like that?

435
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,290
I treat you as my own child,

436
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,780
but you threaten me like this!

437
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,710
You bastards!

438
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,800
You've grown up.

439
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,560
You've really grown up.

440
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,390
Feng.

441
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,230
For the past 20 years,

442
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,150
this is the first request

443
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,210
you proposed to me.

444
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:53,990
Alright.

445
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,390
I promise you.

446
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,220
That woman

447
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,930
sure is something.

448
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,960
Doctrine Leader...

449
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,710
Don't spill it.

450
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,620
Slow down.

451
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,650
Bao, you're great.

452
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,030
Why are you here?

453
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,880
If it weren't for Seven,

454
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,960
I wouldn't have known that

455
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,670
you've been hiding in Yangzhou

456
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,750
for so many years.

457
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,790
Seven and I

458
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,270
only met by chance a few days ago.

459
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,070
Then why did you

460
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,350
leave without saying goodbye?

461
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,080
Why didn't you

462
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,070
tell me?

463
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,200
I wrote you a letter

464
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,910
and invited you to drink with me.

465
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,910
Where have you been all these years?

466
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,550
You wrote to me?

467
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,920
I didn't receive it!

468
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,950
You must have thought that

469
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,190
the letter was from a lady

470
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,590
and threw it away without reading it.

471
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,310
How is that possible?

472
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,990
Why not?

473
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,540
Enough.

474
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,430
Either you fight it out

475
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,230
or get down to business.

476
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,540
We have to wait for my wife to return

477
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,670
and discuss with her

478
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,130
before making a decision.

479
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,250
Fifth Brother.

480
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
Senior Liao said

481
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,830
you can make your own decision.

482
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,630
If you agree,

483
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,910
she will agree.

484
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:49,990
Seven.

485
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,750
I can't go.

486
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,510
Why can't you?

487
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,750
Although you've

488
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,070
left Sword Sect for many years,

489
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,710
the position of the fifth disciple has never been changed.

490
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,640
You're still the Fifth Master Wei.

491
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,930
The Fifth Master of the Sword Sect

492
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,550
should uphold morality

493
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,190
and justice in the martial world.

494
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,920
Even if I have to give up my life,

495
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,630
I would go with you.

496
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,870
It's just death.

497
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,270
There's nothing to fear.

498
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,070
But now,

499
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,270
apart from the justice of the world,

500
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,670
I also have my own family.

501
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,910
Now,

502
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,550
I just want to grow old together with Qingran

503
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,350
and watch Bao grow up healthily.

504
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,950
This is the only wish

505
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,880
in my life.

506
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,760
I can only choose one

507
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,640
between justice and my family.

508
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,730
Fifth Brother.

509
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,710
To be honest,

510
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,710
I envy you

511
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,900
for having a happy family.

512
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,350
I also hope

513
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,680
your wish can come true.

514
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,710
But

515
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,280
if justice isn't upheld,

516
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,840
how can families be protected?

517
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,070
All these years,

518
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,590
everywhere that Yuan Yi Palace has reached

519
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,020
has suffered tremendously.

520
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,910
Many people

521
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,030
are like you,

522
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,750
who just want to protect their families

523
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,150
and live a peaceful life.

524
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,430
But when have the people of Yuan Yi Palace

525
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,430
ever let them be?

526
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,310
Their children

527
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,750
were abducted to Yuan Yi Palace

528
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,550
and forced to become assassins.

529
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,750
So many children

530
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:12,990
could have

531
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,990
lived a peaceful life

532
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,020
with their parents' protection

533
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,420
and grow up without fear.

534
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,850
But they had no choice.

535
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,670
If we don't take this opportunity

536
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,270
to eliminate Yuan Yi Palace,

537
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,050
Chang Wujue

538
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,300
will create more

539
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,700
bloodshed in the future.

540
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,520
If the world is in chaos,

541
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,060
no one can live in peace.

542
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,870
I know.

543
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,120
As Senior Liao's friend,

544
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,800
I received a lot of help from her

545
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,470
and shouldn't be here

546
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,530
persuading you with righteousness.

547
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,080
But I have a selfish motive.

548
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,390
A few years ago,

549
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,110
a remote village was massacred.

550
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,270
One of my friends was involved.

551
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,350
She narrowly escaped death

552
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,750
and survived thanks to

553
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,720
Senior Liao.

554
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,670
But all these years,

555
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,940
she has been suffering from sickness

556
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,270
and countless regrets.

557
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,990
Are you talking about

558
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,190
Qingran's disciple?

559
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,830
Yes.

560
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,430
Mo Family Village was massacred overnight.

561
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,420
This must have something to do

562
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,550
with Yuan Yi Palace.

563
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,910
I also want to seek justice

564
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,970
for the villagers.

565
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,720
I've said everything I need to say.

566
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,470
If you insist on not going,

567
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,750
both of us

568
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,310
won't force you.

569
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,590
Say no more.

570
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,600
Where are we going next?

571
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,110
You're the only disciple left.

572
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,680
Seven!

573
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,350
Eldest Brother is waiting ahead!

574
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,030
Seven!

575
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,200
Eldest Brother is waiting ahead!

576
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,330
Eldest Senior.

577
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,830
-Eldest Brother.
-You're here.

578
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,510
Eldest Senior.

579
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,510
After so many years,

580
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,910
we've finally reunited.

581
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,630
Yeah!

582
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,740
All these years,

583
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,310
we've been traveling around solo

584
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,720
to get rid of evil too.

585
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,440
But it's not as great as

586
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,510
fighting together as a team.

587
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,430
Back then,

588
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,610
[The Second Disciple of Sword Sect, Nangong Mo]

589
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,610
[The Third Disciple of Sword Sect, Xu Ting]

590
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,130
the Sword Sect's Eight...

591
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,430
Eight Swords...

592
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,070
All right.

593
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,870
Six is gone.

594
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,590
We're still alive,

595
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,990
and we can't ruin

596
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,830
the reputation of the Eight Swords of the Sword Sect.

597
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,030
For the battle ahead,

598
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,020
we have to fight to our heart's content.

599
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,630
All these years of disputes in the martial world

600
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,290
were caused by Yuan Yi Palace.

601
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,600
The annihilation of Yuan Yi Palace

602
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
can be considered

603
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,150
an explanation to Sixth Brother, the civilians,

604
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,350
and the martial world

605
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,930
of the Central Plains.

606
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,350
[The First Disciple of Sword Sect, Ye Tianzheng]

607
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,450
This trip to Yuan Yi Palace

608
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,780
must be very dangerous.

609
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,440
The consequences are unpredictable.

610
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,720
No matter how dangerous it is,

611
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,570
to eliminate the treacherous

612
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,070
and protect the people,

613
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,720
even the worst danger

614
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,790
will not

615
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,020
deter us.

616
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,750
I need to find out

617
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,870
where Mingjie is locked up

618
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,630
before making plans.

619
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:48,630
Chief Xue.

620
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,790
Chief Xue.

621
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,850
Doctrine Leader has ordered that

622
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,330
you can't leave this yard.

623
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,580
I just want to take a walk.

624
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,870
Chief Xue.

625
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,870
Chief Xue.

626
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,560
Please go back to your room.

627
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,390
Your Doctrine Leader invited me here

628
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,470
to treat him.

629
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,960
Is this how you

630
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,050
treat your guests?

631
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,470
Chief Xue.

632
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,680
Envoy Miao Shui.

633
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,290
If Chief Xue wants to take a walk,

634
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,530
I’ll accompany her.

635
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,310
If the Doctrine Leader asks,

636
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,990
I'll take the responsibility.

637
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,590
Yes.

638
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,190
Please.

639
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,430
How are the children of

640
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,450
Longmen Village?

641
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,070
Thanks to you,

642
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,060
they are fine.

643
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,870
That kid Long

644
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,860
must have grown taller.

645
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,670
Why do you want to see me?

646
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,610
Just say it.

647
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,640
Can't I chat with you

648
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,670
because I want to?

649
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,910
Don’t go, Chief Xue.

650
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,110
Shall I read your palm?

651
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,750
I can do it.

652
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,310
Chief Xue,

653
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,630
your palm reading

654
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,920
is quite troubling.

655
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,430
This is a broken palm.

656
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,670
A person with such a palm

657
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,650
is usually smart

658
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,910
but exceedingly stubborn.

659
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,060
Your life is full of ups and downs,

660
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,780
and you often cannot help it.

661
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,590
Your destiny line is not bad.

662
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,670
Although it broke halfway,

663
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,550
there's a small branch on it.

664
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,360
It shows that you once escaped from death.

665
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,520
But see here,

666
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,590
your marriage line isn't very optimistic.

667
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,430
Envoy Miao Shui, there's no need for you to talk so much to me.

668
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,490
It's getting late.

669
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,960
I need to go back to rest.

670
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,310
Chief Xue.

671
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,470
Are you going to bed early

672
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,180
to recuperate

673
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,000
and treat the Doctrine Leader?

674
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,590
Yes.

675
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,010
You have excellent medical skills.

676
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,530
Of course you can cure him.

677
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,590
But

678
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,270
I'm afraid saving him

679
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,150
would be dishonoring

680
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,650
the Mo Family Village that was brutally massacred.

681
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,640
In one night,

682
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,510
everyone was killed.

683
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,270
What do you mean by this?

684
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,670
Chief Xue,

685
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,270
you are so smart.

686
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,670
Do you really think that

687
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,400
the Mo Family Village massacre

688
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,890
was done by the Chief of Celestial Alp Sect,

689
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,410
Qiushui He?

690
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,960
He has admitted to

691
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,280
his crime back then.

692
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,190
Yes.

693
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,230
I'm afraid Qiushui He

694
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,660
would never find out that

695
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,310
he just fell for the Doctrine Leader's trap

696
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,790
and became his scapegoat.

697
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,510
Back then, Qiushui He wanted the Eye Magic.

698
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,660
The Doctrine Leader wanted it too.

699
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,990
But he didn't want to alarm the Sword Sect.

700
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,630
So he plotted

701
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,070
for people from Yuan Yi Palace

702
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,000
to mix into the Celestial Alp Sect.

703
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,450
What happened?

704
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,990
[Mo Family Village]

705
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,630
It's time.

706
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,910
Go.

707
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:31,750
Yes.

708
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,270
It was them!

709
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:34,870
Chief!

710
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,270
It was them!

711
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,100
Who are you?

712
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,630
Why did you kill him?

713
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,390
Yes.

714
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,230
Who are you?

715
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,680
Why did you kill him?

716
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,430
Why?

717
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,510
Hold on.

718
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,270
Look!

719
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,330
There's a fire!

720
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,930
The yard is on fire!

721
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,590
They want to burn us to death!

722
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,030
Yes.

723
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,440
They are so evil!

724
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,870
Yes.

725
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,100
You...

726
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,630
You killed our member

727
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,300
and now set the village on fire.

728
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,300
They are trying to

729
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,070
kill us all!

730
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,550
We'll kill them!

731
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,230
You killed and set fire to our village!

732
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,950
They...

733
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,710
The flowers on their swords are snow lotuses!

734
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,310
Are you...

735
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,790
Are you from the Celestial Alp Sect?

736
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,920
Celestial Alp Sect?

737
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,870
Kill!

738
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,620
You're talking nonsense here.

739
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,310
Aren't you afraid that

740
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,990
I’ll report you to the Doctrine Leader?

741
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,800
Be my guest.

742
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,990
But if you want to know

743
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,270
where your Brother Mingjie is,

744
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,990
I advise you not to.

745
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,060
Mingjie is dead.

746
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,470
The cabin

747
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,260
was burning that night.

748
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,470
Before Qiushui He went to the cabin,

749
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,550
the Doctrine Leader

750
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,310
took your brother away

751
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,270
and added to the flames.

752
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,190
He made everyone think

753
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,030
he died

754
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,390
in the fire that night.

755
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,190
Where is Mingjie now?

756
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,190
The Eye you saw today...

757
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,350
is Mingjie.

758
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,560
By the way,

759
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,280
I also heard that

760
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,550
a boy and a girl

761
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,670
fell into the icy river that night.

762
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,910
If my guess was right,

763
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,310
it was you, right?

764
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,390
Chief Xue.

765
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,020
So what?

766
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,490
What an ill-fated relationship.

767
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,360
The person who broke the ice

768
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,720
and made you fall into the icy river back then

769
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,920
is now trying his best

770
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,230
to protect you

771
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,840
and even brought you to Yuan Yi Palace.

772
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,350
Interesting.

773
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,190
How interesting.

774
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,840
What?

775
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,000
It was Miao Feng?

776
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,760
Chief Xue,

777
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,350
you’ll regret it.

778
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,580
Now,

779
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,670
Chief Xue,

780
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,400
do you still want to save the Doctrine Leader?

781
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,360
Envoy Miao Shui,

782
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,070
you must be telling me

783
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,530
these things for a reason.

784
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,430
What do you want?

785
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,830
I'll tell you

786
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,390
what I want tomorrow.

787
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,920
I'll bring you a bargain

788
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,430
that you can’t refuse.

789
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,270
Rest early, Chief Xue.

790
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,550
Chief Xue.

791
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,190
It’s late.

792
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,220
Where did you go just now?

793
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,350
I just walked around.

794
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,630
What's up?

795
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,590
Nothing.

796
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,610
I’m just here to tell you

797
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,230
to have a good rest.

798
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:13,920
Later,

799
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,310
I will take you

800
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,910
to the Doctrine Leader's sleeping hall

801
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,790
to treat him.

802
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,770
Rest early, Chief Xue.

803
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,110
Wait.

804
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,500
Anything else?
