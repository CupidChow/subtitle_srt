In a few days,

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,870
it will be the New Year festival.

6
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,670
If Mr. Huo

7
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,790
is not in a hurry to leave,

8
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,230
we could still have dumplings together.

9
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,890
That's right,

10
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,320
there are still four herbs to collect anyway.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,630
A few more days won't make a difference.

12
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,710
With one more person,

13
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,210
we can have a few more delicious dishes.

14
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,870
You're just thinking about food,

15
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,670
how could you understand his anxiety?

16

Haste makes waste,

18
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,910
I hope Mr. Huo

19
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,610
can find the next herb soon.

20
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,070
That's hard to say.

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,670
He said he was going to Yangzhou.

22
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,720
I've heard Yangzhou is a world of splendor.

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,829
What if he goes there,

24
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,390
gets dazzled by the splendor,

25
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,670
and loses interest in searching for the herbs?

26
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,070
He's not one to indulge in worldly pleasures.

27
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,600
He certainly won't do that.

28
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,240
Chief.

29
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,180
But obtaining the next herb

30
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,250
is indeed difficult.

31
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,630
When we got the previous herb,

32
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,750
it was while Jing

33
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,910
happened to be away from the Moon Sect.

34
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,370
Though it was a close call,

35
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,329
there was still a glimmer of luck.

36
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm afraid that getting this second herb

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,410
will be even more challenging.

38
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,110
Silly bird,

39
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,610
your master has already left the valley.

40
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,810
Why did you come back?

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,230
Chief,

42
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,910
what did Mr. Seven write?

43
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,950
Determination is like a crutch,

44
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,190
helping one break through wind and snow.

45
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,550
That day, in my haste,

46
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,180
I falsely claimed this branch was a hairpin,

47
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,960
which allowed us to break through the storm together and return.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,090
I carved this branch

49
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,430
as an apology

50
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,110
and as mutual encouragement for us.

51
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,920
From: Seven.

52
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,430
So that day,

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
he was carving wood in the courtyard

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,790
for this.

55
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,510
His knife skills are not bad,

56
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,990
albeit a little clumsy.

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,950
That should be about right.

58
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,610
Take a look.

59
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,670
It's quite good.

61

66
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,190
Of course I do.

69

Look,

70

look who's here.

71
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,050
Isn't this the young hero?

72
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,250
Young hero,

73
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,890
my surname is Meng.

74
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm a few years older than you.

75
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,350
From now on,

76
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,700
let's not be so formal.

77
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,510
You can call me Brother Meng.

78
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,070
Then I'll respectfully comply.

79
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,870

The young hero is indeed a straightforward person.

Don't call me

"young hero" anymore.

86
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,030

Alright.

91
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,990
Okay.

92

addressing each other as brothers.

95
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,270
So today,

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,910
you must stay for a drink.

97

98
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,150
I'm really in a hurry to get going.

99
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,070
After I fill up my wine,

100
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,930
I have to leave.

101
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,190
Look, it's already getting dark.

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,590
The road is dangerous at night.

103
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,310
A small delay wouldn't hurt,

104
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,310
would it?

105
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,270
You haven't tried

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,800
my wife's cooking yet, have you?

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,380
That's right.

108
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,750
You absolutely can't leave.

109
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,350
That's right.

110
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,080
You can't go.

111
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,230
Then I'll be imposing on you.

112
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,670
This Seven

113
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,190
not only stole our Moon Sect's sacred object

114
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,860
but also left the ancient tomb in this state.

115
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,260
Chief, please calm down.

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,350
Oh, right.

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,510
I asked you to find

118
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,909
records about the Mo Family Village.

119
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,170
Did you find anything?

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,950
I did find something,

121
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,000
but...

122
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,730
Chief, please take a look.

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,040
How could this have happened?

124
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,170
The bamboo scroll fell into

125
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,110
the pool next to the Seven-Leaf Fungus

126
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,110
and was corroded.

127
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,390
How am I supposed to

128
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,590
explain this to Ziye?

129
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,830
If I may be so bold,

130
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,590
may I know why you're

131
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,810
suddenly investigating the Mo Family Village incident?

132
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,280
When the Mo Family Village was massacred,

133
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,360
our sect's unique arsenopyrite was found there.

134
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,010
Our sect didn't participate in the massacre,

135
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,940
so why did the poison appear there?

136
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,330
The arsenopyrite was always kept in

137
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,310
the medicine room of the Moon Palace.

138
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,950
One year, the medicine room was robbed,

139
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,080
and only the arsenopyrite was stolen.

140
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,230
Which year was that?

141
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,690
The fourth year of Huijia.

142
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,070
Did we find the culprit

143
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,909
behind it?

144
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,350
The disciple guarding the medicine room that day

145
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,790
had a confrontation with the thief.

146
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,980
Where is that person now?

147
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,710
Find her.

148
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,830
Yes.

Why did you abandon me?

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,720
Come back!

351
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,150
Who's going to compensate me for my losses?

352
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,390
I've lost everything.

353
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,150
Fourth Brother,

354
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,080
long time no see.

355
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,080
If you're smart,

356
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,920
you'll let these ladies go.

357
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,890
Otherwise,

358
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,420
don't blame us for being impolite.

359
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,110
Young Master,

360
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,010
it's not that I don't want to release them.

361
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,310
It's just that these ladies

362
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,780
have signed indenture contracts.

363
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,620
They can't leave.

364
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,740
Indenture contracts?

365
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,940
There really are indenture contracts?

366
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,740
It's absolutely true.

367
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,570
Otherwise, look,

368
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,500
I haven't tied them up or anything.

369
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,730
If they wanted to run,

370
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,540
they would have done so already.

371
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,640
Impossible.

372
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,050
I don't believe it.

373
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,910
It's true.

374
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,270
I just bought them.

375
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,630
Look,

376
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,010
it's still warm.

377
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,430
Here.

378
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,950
Young Master, if you don't believe me,

379
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,610
take a look.

380
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,359
My indenture contracts...

381
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,520
What indenture contracts?

382
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,839
I've never seen one.

383
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,089
Indenture contracts.

384
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,790
Young Master,

385
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,849
you've seen it too.

386
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,430
-Alright.
-I’m just the owner of...

387

We won't make things difficult for you.

388
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,500
Keep the money.

389
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,550
As long as we can save

390
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,310
all these ladies from their misery,

391
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,590
it's worth any amount of money.

392
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,320
You all should go home quickly.

393
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,050
Young Master,

394
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,120
this won't do!

395
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,430
If you let them go,

396
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,870
how will my Linglong Flower Realm

397
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,000
continue to do business in the future?

398
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,760
Madam,

399
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,690
let these ladies go.

400
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,630
Those who still have a way out

401

[Courtesan of Linglong Flower Realm: Liu Feifei]

402
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,830
shouldn't be here at Linglong Flower Realm.

403
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,890
Don't force them against their will.

404
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,680
Could you be Liu Feifei, the top courtesan of Linglong Flower Realm?

405
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,030
Since Miss Liu has spoken,

406
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,950
let's do as she says.

407
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,350
Ladies,

408
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,810
you can all go home now.

409
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,780
Ladies,

410
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,950
you may go now.

411
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,190
Wait.

412
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,920
Great.

413
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,470
Which one of you is Ting'er?

414
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,510
I... I am Ting'er.

415
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,150
Hero,

416
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,750
thank you for your great kindness.

417

Hero,

420
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,510
thank you for your immense kindness.

421
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,200
Our entire family

422
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,510
will remember you for eight generations...

423
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:40,790
No,

424
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,620
even in our ancestral graves,

425
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,030
we will never forget you.

426
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,510
Hero.

427
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,030
Old sir,

428
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,010
you're exaggerating.

429
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,590
If we're talking about this,

430
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,330
we should thank these two heroes.

431
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,320
Just thank them.

432
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,580
Thank you,

433
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,870
th-thank you, three heroes.

434
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,030
But my daughter and I

435
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,520
truly have no way to repay you.

436
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,180
It's all because of my illness

437
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,610
that drained our family's savings.

438
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,010
Otherwise, I...

439
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,610
Or maybe...

440
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,170
Hero, do you think my daughter is...

441
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,010
pleasing to the eye?

442
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,730
-Please don't.
-Father.

443
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,510
Old sir,

444
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,650
you absolutely must not

445
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,510
entrust your daughter

446
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,630
to just anyone.

447
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,340
Well...

448
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,750
The two of you

449
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,570
should find a place to stay here.

450
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,230
After things settle down,

451
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,150
find some work.

452
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,430
Things will get better from there.

453
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,230
Alright,

454
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,000
thank you.

455
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,350
Thank you.

456
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,510
We'll be going then.

457
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,040
Let's go.

458
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,600
Let's go.

Wait a moment.

Don't walk so fast!

Seventh Brother,

475
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,150
it's been a long time since we've seen each other.

476
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,280
Let's get together.

477
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,110
Of course, let's go.

478
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,760

Eighth Brother.

482
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,360
Today was truly exhilarating.

483
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,510
It's been about two years

484
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,750
since the three of us last met.

485

Come,

let's have a drink.

487

I won't drink with you.

Miss Liu Feifei.

491
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,750
This time, because of you again,

00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,710
I couldn't see her beautiful face

By the way,

Seventh Brother,

503
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,950
why are you here in Yangzhou?

504
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,170
Is it for the Azure Phoenix Flower?

505
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,440
That's right.

506
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,270
This matter is fraught with difficulties.

507
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,630
As one of the seven disciples of the Sword Sect,

508
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,430
I've naturally come

509
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,430
to lend you a hand.

With your help,

511
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,660
we'll surely be able to stop Qin Tiancheng

from defecting to Yuan Yi Palace.

Qin Tiancheng of the Seven Disciples of White Cloud Palace

514
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,360
is defecting to Yuan Yi Palace?

515
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,050
That is truly despicable.

516
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,390
Indeed.

517
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,950
Not only did Qin Tiancheng defect,

518
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,430
but he also took the sacred object of White Cloud Palace,

519
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,680
the Azure Phoenix Flower,

520

to use it as a token of allegiance.

Yuan Yi Palace has been in retreat in Kunlun for years,

Why have they suddenly appeared in the Central Plains?

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,190
It must be that Chang Wujue's evil ambitions haven't died.

525
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,250
The chief suspects

526
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,470
that Chang Wujue has been practicing

527
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,970
the Iron Horse Glacier technique for years

528
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,510
but has been unable to break through.

529
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,630
This Azure Phoenix Flower

530
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,910
is likely to be of great benefit

531
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,340
to the mental technique he's cultivating.

532
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,510
If the Azure Phoenix Flower really falls

533
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,110
into the hands of Yuan Yi Palace,

534
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,230
the martial arts world of the Central Plains

535
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,230
will likely never know peace again.

536
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,540
As the leader of the righteous sects, the Sword Sect

537
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,990
should naturally assist White Cloud Palace

538
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,650
in preventing this martial world catastrophe.

539
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,040
Eighth Brother,

540
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,710
My intel is not up to date.

541
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,070
Do you know where and when

542
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,230
Qin Tiancheng and the people from Yuan Yi Palace

543
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,670
have agreed to meet?

544
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,830
The chief did indeed provide information.

545
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,090
Fourth Brother.

546
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,590
Seventh Brother,

547
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,630
the chief said

548
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,590
this is a secret message

549
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,510
that Qin Tiancheng sent to Yuan Yi Palace

550
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,170
to arrange the meeting place.

551
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,250
But this is just an ordinary poem.

552
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,500
Neither Fourth Brother nor I could see

553
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,630
the hidden message.

554
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,430
A poem?

555
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,710
On a cold night, the guest is served with tea instead of wine.

556
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,830
The bamboo stove boils, the fire just turning red.

557
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,960
The moon before the window is as usual.

558
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,690
But with plum blossoms, it's different indeed.

559
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,550
In the poem, tea was served in place of wine,

560
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,950
indicating that besides tea,

561
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,120
there should also be wine.

562
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,910
The phrase 'just turning red' is ambiguous,

563
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,640
the 'moon' actually refers to romance,

564
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,670
and the 'flower' actually means courtesan.

565
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,030
The only place in Yangzhou where one can

566
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,750
seek romance in the middle of the night

567
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,410
is the Linglong Flower Realm.

568
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,240
But I must

569
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,520
lead Eighth Brother and the others away.

570
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,510
Qin Tiancheng is being deliberately mysterious.

571
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,170
There must be some hidden meaning in this paper.

572
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,160
The location

573
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,890
is hidden in this poem.

574
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,010
Have you already figured out

575
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,930
the secret?

576
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,710
Here.

577
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,030
Look at this.

578
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,890
This is a poem about drinking tea.

579
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,800
It mentions the moon

580
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,310
and emphasizes

581
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,890
plum blossoms.

582
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,550
The signature dish of this restaurant

583
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,110
is the Nine-Curved Red Plum.

584
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,630
This indicates that the time and place

585
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,430
is tomorrow when the moon rises,

586
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,870
here at the Hesheng Teahouse.

587
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,630
You're not just

588
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,110
making far-fetched connections, are you?

589
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,790
What Seventh Brother said matches perfectly.

590
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,790
It should be this Hesheng Teahouse.

591
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,070
I'll go back and tell

592
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070
the people from White Cloud Palace.

593
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,070
Tomorrow, we'll meet up with them

594
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,950
here

595
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,710
before going to catch the person.

596
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,390
Seventh Brother,

597
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,850
are you coming with us too?

598
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,230
Then I'll

599
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,790
wait for you here tomorrow.

600
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,600
Fourth Brother,

601
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,110
you're going too, right?

602
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm not going.

603
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,200
Why?

604
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,990
This matter is either him or me,

605
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,830
me or him.

606
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,810
You choose.

607
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,520
Fourth Brother,

608
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,140
Yuan Yi Palace's threat

609
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,200
is no small matter.

610
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,910
As disciples of the Sword Sect, it's our duty to eliminate evil and uphold righteousness.

611
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,230
We have no choice but to act.

612
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,030
This is not the time for us brothers to fight among ourselves.

613
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,830
Fight among ourselves, you say?

614
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,430
Who started this internal dispute?

615
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,680
The Sword Sect clearly had eight disciples.

616
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,990
How did it become seven disciples?

617
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,150
Xu Chonghua injured many

618
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,190
elders of the Sword Sect.

619
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,050
Since that day,

620
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,460
he was no longer one of the eight disciples.

621
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,750
I know Sixth Brother betrayed us.

622
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,390
But the chief only ordered

623
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,390
to bring him back.

624
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,070
He didn't say to kill him.

625
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,870
You didn't care about the friendship

626
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,800
between us eight disciples at all.

627
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,550
He used to care for you the most.

628
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,210
You were even sworn brothers.

629
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,930
You could have crippled his martial arts

630
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,260
or cut off one of his arms

631
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,770
and still spared his life.

632
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,110
Why did you have to go to such extremes?

633
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,580
Xu Chonghua betrayed the sect

634
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,740
and severely wounded his masters.

635
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,800
He deserved to die.

636
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,430
Seventh Brother did nothing wrong.

637
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,840
But in this world, there's not just the law,

638
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,100
there's also emotion.

639
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,390
Alright, stop arguing.

640
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:07,960
Shut up.

641
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,510
I...

642
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,720
Those who follow different paths cannot work together.

643
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,570
Eighth Brother...

644
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm leaving.

645
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,530
Fourth Brother...

646
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,590
Sir,

647
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,680
please settle the bill before leaving.

648
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,050
Didn't those two pay the bill yet?

649
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:40,620
Not yet.

650
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,970
I'm not trying to leave.

651
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,230
I'm just going to find someone.

652
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,290
I'll be right back.

653
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,140
Sir.

654
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,590
I've seen many people like you.

655
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,070
If you don't have money, just say so.

656
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,350
Trying to run away without paying

657
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,950
is absolutely not possible.

658
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,390
I'm not trying to skip out on the bill.

659
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,780
I...

660
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,430
Innkeeper,

661
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,910
put Mr. Huo's bill

662
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,760
on my tabs.

663
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,910
You must be

664
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,090
the famous courtesan,

665
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,810
Liu Feifei.

666
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,350
Nice to meet you, Mr. Seven.

667
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,600
You know who I am?

668
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,190
You may have forgotten,

669
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,350
but Mr. Xia had already revealed himself

670
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,440
as the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect.

671
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,630
And that Eighth Brother called you Seventh Brother.

672
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,640
If I didn't have even this much discernment,

673
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,950
then I as a courtesan

674
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,700
would be unworthy of my title.

675
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,150
I see.

676
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,950
Today at the Linglong Flower Realm,

677
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,010
I saw you from afar.

678
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,830
I didn't expect to run into you here again.

679
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,830
What a coincidence.

680
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,160
It's not a coincidence.

681
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,550
I came here

682
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,080
specifically for you, sir.

683
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,750
For me?

684
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,830
Although I am a courtesan,

685
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,070
I still understand right from wrong.

686
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,390
I despise forcing innocent girls into prostitution the most.

687
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,270
To be honest,

688
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,110
before you gentlemen arrived,

689
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,270
I also wanted to rescue

690
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,000
those girls.

691
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,640
But being in this world of courtesans,

692
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,150
I truly had the will but not the means.

693

is the duty of us martial artists.

We shouldn't ask for any reward.

However,

and flay you alive?

787

Your father.

820

The real transaction location

847

is at the Linglong Flower Realm in the east of the city.

848

I have already gone ahead.

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,500
Eighth Brother.

865
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,720
Fourth Brother.

866
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,600
What happened?

867
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,230
The location has changed. I'll explain on the way.

868
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,760
Let's go.

869
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,030
[Linglong Flower Realm]

870
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,040
Please come in, honored guest.

871
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,190
Alright, alright.

872
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,270
Alright, alright!

873
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,590
Mr. Huo.

874
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,550
Can you still run?

875
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,710
I've even stopped to wait for you.

876
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,840
I can't run anymore.

877
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,470
But I still have the strength

878
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,600
to beat you to death!

879
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,660
Your martial arts are inadequate,

880
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,880
but your boasting skills are exceptional.

881
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,830
Are all the people from Yuan Yi Palace

882
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,750
like this?

883
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm different from those useless people.

884
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,950
Do you need to bring so many useless people

885
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,280
to deal with a mere seventh disciple

886
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,070
of the Sword Sect?

887
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,310
If even you

888
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,240
lose to me later,

889
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,910
then your Yuan Yi Palace

890
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,570
would lose face, wouldn't it?

891
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,730
How about this?

892
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,150
Call me your dad

893
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,910
and I'll spare your life.

894
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,750
Screw that! I already have a dad!

895
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,520
Die!

896
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,440
Seven?

897
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,840
You're back.

898
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,670
I'm grateful for your guidance, Seven.

899
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,460
I've thought it through.

900
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,200
I...

901
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,110
I'm already ugly enough,

902
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,870
and you still punched my face.

903
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,630
That's right, I'm pinching your cheek.

904
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,070
-Again?
-What’s wrong?

905
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,730
Let go of me!

906
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Hit me if you dare.

907
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,050
I'll punch you once you let go!

908
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,440
Alright.

909
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm done playing with you today.

910
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,600
When you see me, your dad, again,

911
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,110
remember to kowtow to admit your guilt.

912
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,710
Bullshit.

913
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,690
My dad would never strike my pressure points.

914
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,670
Come back!

915
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,210
Don't you dare leave!

916
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,150
I'll beat you to death one day!

917
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,780
Get out of the way!

918
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,010
Tiancheng!

919
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,200
Tiancheng.

920
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,890
Tiancheng?

921
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,890
Tiancheng!

922
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,230
How could this happen?

923
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,890
Tiancheng.

924
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,470
Wake up.

925
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:06,910
Tell me,

926
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,760
who did this?

927
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,280
Huo Zhanbai...

928
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,870
He stole the Azure Phoenix Flower.

929
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,640
He wanted to kill... kill me.

930
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,470
Just now...

931
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,160
Just now...

932
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,500
Tiancheng?

933
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,690
Tiancheng!

934
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,230
Tiancheng!

935
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,910
Tiancheng!

936
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,360
I will avenge you.

937
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,310
Find Huo Zhanbai.

938
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,140
I want him to pay with his life.

939
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,830
It can't be Seventh Brother.

940
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,470
Chief Lin.

941
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,550
This matter is suspicious and needs further investigation.

942
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,880
Before Tiancheng died,

943
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,060
he personally identified the killer.

944
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,260
How could it be false?

945
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,070
Moreover,

946
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,360
why were we late?

947
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,890
It was because of your dear Seventh Brother.

948
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,500
He deliberately led us to the west of the city

949
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,830
so he could take action.

950
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,710
Just now at the teahouse,

951
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,410
the tea shop owner left you a letter.

952
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,750
After you read it,

953
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,070
you realized the location was wrong.

954
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,400
Who left you the letter?

955
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,040
What did the letter say?

956
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,450
It's just an ordinary letter.

957
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,830
Chief Lin, you're overthinking it.

958
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,950
At this moment,

959
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,340
I can't help but be cautious.

960
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,050
Give me the letter.

961
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,990
Chief Lin,

962
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,570
is there some misunderstanding?

963
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,780
What letter?

964
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,330
Give me the letter!

965
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,750
Look carefully.

966
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,820
It's written in black and white.

967
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,550
Huo Zhanbai wanted to steal the Azure Phoenix Flower.

968
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,270
And the Azure Phoenix Flower

969
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,800
was on Tiancheng's person.

970
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,110
Now the flower is gone, and the person is dead.

971
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,470
How can you defend him?

972
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,210
He failed to steal the flower,

973
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,650
so he killed him for it.

974
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,880
He stole the treasures of the White Cloud Palace,

975
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,350
killed a member of the White Cloud Palace,

976
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,230
and destroyed our Seven Star Sword Formation.

977
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,030
That Huo Zhanbai has some nerve!

978
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,600
Everyone in our White Cloud Palace

979
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,670
will not let this go.

980
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,360
Find Huo Zhanbai

981
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,950
and make him pay with his life!

982
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,550
Yes.

983
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,150
Fourth Brother...
