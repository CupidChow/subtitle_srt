[Episode 29]

4
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,430
You know everything?

5
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,520
Back then,

6
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,030
you used

7
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,630
the darts with arsenopyrite

8
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,100
to hit Xuehuai.

9
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,710
Then you used Spring Breeze

10
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,990
to break the ice,

11
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,870
plunging us into the icy river.

12
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,790
And you

13
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,230
knew

14
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,840
everything you did to us,

15
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,190
right?

16
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,590
In order to obtain the Eye Magic,

17
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,750
you led Qiushui He into the trap.

18
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,720
You burned the village,

19
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,670
killed innocent people,

20
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,310
and escaped unscathed.

21
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,150
If Xuehuai hadn't

22
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,650
taken this dart for me,

23
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,190
I'd have been buried instead.

24
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,910
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,010
I don't want to hear your apology.

26
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,670
Tell me.

27
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,710
Why did you do it?

28
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,270
I don't want to

29
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,750
hear it from others.

30
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,310
I want you to answer me in person.

31
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,070
Why?

32
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,670
Why did you do it?

33
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,790
Did the Doctrine Leader

34
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,710
ask you to do it?

35
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,630
Tell me.

36
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,030
Was it the Doctrine Leader's order?

37
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,829
Why aren't you saying anything?

38
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,800
Answer me.

39
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,790
Why did you do it?

40
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,480
You’re injured.

41
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,220
Don’t worry about me.

42
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,950
It's from the cane.

43
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,190
That bastard leader of yours punished you!

44
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,320
You were so obedient

45
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,120
and loyal to him,

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
why did he hit you?

47
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,400
Chief Xue, don’t be rude to him.

48
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,230
Thank you, Chief Xue.

49
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,670
Is that person

50
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,800
so important to you?

51
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,200
No matter what he asks you to do,

52
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,390
you will agree?

53
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,810
Without the Doctrine Leader,

54
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,150
I would have long turned to dust.

55
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,990
I don't belong to myself.

56
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,310
I only live for the Doctrine Leader.

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,070
I see.

58
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,070
You may leave.

59
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,790
Since you now know the truth,

60
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,110
what would you do?

61
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,030
This is the territory of

62
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,090
the Yuan Yi Palace.

63
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,230
What can I do

64
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,630
alone here?

65
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,570
I hope you understand that

66
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,830
I will always be by the Doctrine Leader's side

67
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,190
to keep him safe.

68
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,910
As long as you

69
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,440
can cure the Doctrine Leader,

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
I will protect you

71
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,920
and the Apothecary Valley.

72
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,280
I want to save you.

73
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,490
What should I do

74
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,500
to cure you,

75
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,750
Ya Mi?

76
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,290
It’s time to end it.

77
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,350
When Chief Xue cures

78
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,870
Doctrine Leader's sickness,

79
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,600
I'll send her off the mountain as soon as possible

80
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,020
to avoid more trouble.

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,590
Up ahead is the

82
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,190
Yuan Yi Palace's territory.

83
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,930
There might be traps.

84
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,590
Be careful.

85
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,350
Let's take a look.

86
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,480
Let's go.

87
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,270
Seven.

88
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,210
Something seems to have happened there.

89
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,990
Eldest Brother.

90
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,370
The Wolf Fang Mace.

91
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
You know this weapon?

92
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,670
This is the famous weapon of Tong Jue,

93
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,550
an assassin of the Yuan Yi Palace's Asura Field.

94
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,610
He once dominated the Western Region

95
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,740
and took many lives.

96
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,270
Later, he became a top assassin

97
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,270
of Yuan Yi Palace,

98
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,690
one of the Eight Elites.

99
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,200
But why

100
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,510
is it found here?

101
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,900
Out of the Eight Elites,

102
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,230
seven of them died here.

103
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,710
Judging from their bodies' placement,

104
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,570
it seems to have been a formation.

105
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,110
Tong Jue.

106
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,870
Zhui Feng.

107
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,480
Nie Jing.

108
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,230
Chen Fu.

109
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,830
Yan Zhi.

110
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,750
These five people

111
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,230
were obviously using Yuan Yi Palace's

112
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,630
Heaven's Net Formation.

113
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,430
The Eight Elites joined forces in an ambush,

114
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,830
but were all killed here.

115
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,870
Their enemy's martial arts skill

116
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,910
is unbelievable.

117
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,710
Looks like we need to

118
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,590
get to Yuan Yi Palace as soon as possible

119
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,120
in case something happens.

120
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,350
What a pity.

121
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,940
The Chief of the Apothecary Valley offended the Doctrine Leader

122
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,210
and was beheaded.

123
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,510
I was lying.

124
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,870
Look how scared you were.

125
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,910
It seems you already know that Xue Ziye

126
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,240
is your old friend from Mo Family Village.

127
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,310
You were afraid to let the Doctrine Leader

128
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,710
know about her identity.

129
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,350
That's why you held back from

130
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,550
recognizing her in Yuan Yi Hall, right?

131
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,610
That's rare.

132
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,020
To think there's someone in this world

133
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
whom you want to protect.

134
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,990
What do you want?

135
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,150
Tell me.

136
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,500
Let's exchange conditions.

137
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,950
As long as you tell me

138
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,480
the entrance to the armory,

139
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,790
I'll give you whatever you want.

140
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,510
The Doctrine Leader has put the Lixue sword

141
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,070
in the armory, right?

142
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,300
You failed once,

143
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,370
but you still want to kill him?

144
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,870
Next time,

145
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,760
you won't be lucky enough

146
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,010
to get away unscathed.

147
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,670
That's none of your business.

148
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,600
If you want to die faster,

149
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,470
just tell me.

150
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,550
Let her go back safely,

151
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,510
and I'll tell you.

152
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,360
Her?

153
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,510
Your sister?

154
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,190
That's right.

155
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,710
Okay.

156
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,410
I promise you.

157
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,720
I didn't expect that

158
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,230
you would

159
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,980
also abandon yourself

160
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,830
to protect her.

161
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,190
The entrance

162
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,910
is in the secret room in the Asura Field.

163
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,510
I always spend time alone in.

164
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,720
The mechanism is under the candlestick.

165
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,280
If you lie to me,

166
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,710
you know

167
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,910
what I will do, right?

168
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,280
And what if you break your promise?

169
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,570
In your current situation,

170
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,890
you can only trust me.

171
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,640
No point being suspicious.

172
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,830
Still, Xue Ziye

173
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,190
is really amazing.

174
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,150
Miao Feng and you

175
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,630
are actually

176
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,670
protecting her with your lives.

177
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,440
Could it be that

178
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,480
she has

179
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,880
some kind of charm on her?

180
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,670
Miao Feng?

181
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,480
Yes.

182
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,710
Speaking of which,

183
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,950
I need to thank her.

184
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,670
Thanks to her,

185
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,110
the Spring Breeze mental technique has been broken.

186
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,950
Now he only has

187
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,190
70% of his power.

188
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,280
The most tricky Miao Feng

189
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,870
is now no longer a threat.

190
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,880
Miao Kong

191
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,510
doesn't care to be in charge.

192
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
Ming Li and Miao Huo are both dead,

193
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,070
and you've become like this.

194
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,510
There's only Miao Feng left.

195
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,730
I'm afraid even without Spring Breeze,

196
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,990
Miao Feng wouldn't be

197
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,650
an easy opponent to deal with.

198
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,650
I don't need your advice.

199
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,090
I have a plan.

200
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,230
Mind your own business.

201
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,190
Chief Xue.

202
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,860
Come in.

203
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,040
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

204
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,630
Okay.

205
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,110
Aren't you going to ask where you're going?

206
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,670
You're holding the Lixue sword.

207
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,120
You've met Mingjie.

208
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,790
I like

209
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,350
dealing with smart people.

210
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,440
Let's go.

211
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,280
Don't worry.

212
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,950
I fed it something.

213
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,030
It won't wake up before dawn.

214
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,950
Let's go.

215
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,950
What's wrong?

216
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,190
That...

217
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:37,670
That is...

218
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,950
To break through the mental technique cultivation,

219
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,280
Chang Wujue needed children born at noon.

220
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,450
So he sent Ming Li to look for some.

221
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,390
One of them was a boy.

222
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,100
The safety pendant

223
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,830
belonged to him.

224
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,620
What about that child?

225
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,490
What about the others?

226
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,200
Chang Wujue sought them

227
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,430
for an attempt.

228
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,640
It failed, unfortunately.

229
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,100
Since the children became useless,

230
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,620
they had to be disposed of.

231
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,350
Just like everyone who made a mistake

232
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,030
in Yuan Yi Palace,

233
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,040
they were buried in the garden.

234
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,070
He found this pendant interesting,

235
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,430
so he kept it

236
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,980
and hung it on his favorite dog.

237
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,780
How ironic.

238
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,350
The safety pendant failed to keep him safe.

239
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,950
This child

240
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,070
can probably

241
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,510
reunite with his family.

242
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,390
What?

243
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,030
Does this boy

244
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,790
have anything to do with you?

245
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,190
This safety lock

246
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,240
is for Chu's child.

247
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,800
Looks like he owes another blood debt.

248
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,790
Where is he?

249
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,070
In the corner.

250
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,150
Mingjie.

251
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,080
Mingjie.

252
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,390
Get lost!

253
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,340
Mingjie.

254
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,710
It's me.

255
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,310
Miao Shui!

256
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,510
What do you want?

257
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,030
What exactly do you want?

258
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,540
Why did you bring her here?

259
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,880
Why did you bring her here?

260
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,990
Why are you yelling at me?

261
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,790
I can be

262
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,430
kindhearted sometimes.

263
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,730
Speaking of which,

264
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,780
I guess you two are reunited now.

265
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,630
Eye.

266
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,230
I've got the Lixue sword.

267
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
You two

268
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,590
should say your goodbyes.

269
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,830
Time is running out.

270
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,150
I'll wait for you by the cage.

271
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,710
Mingjie...

272
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,080
Your eyes...

273
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,150
Leave me alone!

274
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,270
Get lost!

275
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,550
Mingjie...

276
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,630
Mingjie!

277
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,590
It's me, Mingjie!

278
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,690
Your sister is here.

279
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,490
Why are you forcing me like this?

280
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,630
Why did you come?

281
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,580
I left the Apothecary Valley

282
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,710
because I don't want to implicate you.

283
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,980
Why did you come?

284
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,680
Your Mingjie died a long time ago.

285
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,870
He's long dead!

286
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,550
Mingjie.

287
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,440
Mingjie.

288
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,070
Don't...

289
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,630
Don't think that way.

290
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,230
Mingjie.

291
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,070
Mingjie, I know.

292
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,010
No matter what you become,

293
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,910
you'll always be my Mingjie.

294
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,850
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

295
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,030
I will take you away from here.

296
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,110
It's okay.

297
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
It's okay.

298
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,910
Mingjie.

299
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,510
Be good.

300
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,070
It's okay.

301
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,350
Let me look at your wounds.

302
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,540
Let me look at your wounds, okay?

303
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,390
It's useless.

304
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,390
It's useless.

305
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,360
It's useless now...

306
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,370
I was poisoned by Soul Devouring Powder.

307
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,640
Soul Devouring Powder?

308
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,720
I'm going to die.

309
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,210
Leave me alone.

310
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,230
Sister Ye.

311
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,470
I’m here.

312
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,060
I'm here.

313
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,910
I'm right here.

314
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,070
I'm right here with you.

315
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,100
I know now.

316
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,990
You and Xuehuai

317
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,170
have never abandoned me.

318
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,830
Let's not talk about this.

319
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,270
Let's not talk about this anymore.

320
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,750
It's all in the past.

321
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,590
Something like that will never

322
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,390
happen again.

323
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,070
Don't save Chang Wujue.

324
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,990
He will kill you.

325
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,390
Go down the mountain now.

326
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,060
I deserve this.

327
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,240
Don't waste your effort to save me.

328
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,470
Nonsense.

329
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,940
No matter what you did,

330
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,350
as long as I'm alive,

331
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,550
I won't leave you alone.

332
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,830
Sister,

333
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,370
I was poisoned by Soul Devouring Powder.

334
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,590
You are a doctor.

335
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,510
You know what that means.

336
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,220
Leave me.

337
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,510
Go.

338
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,630
Hurry!

339
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,930
Find a way to go down the mountain.

340
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,150
Sister.

341
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,790
Leave me.

342
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,480
Go!

343
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,510
Go!

344
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,950
Go!

345
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,700
Wait for me.

346
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,980
I'll be right back.

347
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,590
Sister.

348
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,320
Where are you going?

349
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,070
Don't worry.

350
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm not leaving.

351
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,890
I'll be right back.

352
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,690
Sister.

353
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,610
Wait for me.

354
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,390
Sister!

355
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,480
Wait for me.

356
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,500
Sister Ye.

357
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,030
Sister!

358
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,230
Wait for me.

359
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,030
Sister, don't go.

360
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,710
Sister, don't go!

361
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,470
Sister, don't go!

362
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,670
Leave!

363
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,380
Sister, don't go!

364
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,110
What?

365
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,830
You're out so soon?

366
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:19,910
I thought

367
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,390
you'd talk more to each other

368
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,320
during your hard-earned reunion.

369
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,160
Give me the key.

370
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,230
What key?

371
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,830
The key to the lock.

372
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,200
Give it to me.

373
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,350
Chief Xue.

374
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,240
Don’t you think that demand

375
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,370
is a little too much?

376
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,560
Why should I give it to you?

377
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,110
Eye is a traitor.

378
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,830
If I do this,

379
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,070
I'd be betraying the Doctrine Leader.

380
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,600
Don't beat around the bush.

381
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,270
I know you want to kill the Doctrine Leader.

382
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,190
Aren’t you afraid I'd kill you

383
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,230
for spouting such nonsense?

384
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,260
You won't.

385
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,520
Because you need me.

386
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,670
Soul Devouring Powder is the best poison in the world.

387
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,190
I can't cure it at all.

388
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,930
I just don't want him

389
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,330
to be locked like a dog.

390
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,360
If you give me the key,

391
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,710
I'll help you.

392
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,670
Tomorrow.

393
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,030
How bold of you.

394
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,530
How confident are you?

395
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,230
I have a higher chance

396
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,310
of success

397
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,240
than you.

398
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,480
I will avenge Mingjie

399
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,970
and the Mo Family Village.

400
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,170
Give me the key.

401
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,630
I'll cooperate with you.

402
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,380
Here.

403
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,670
I'll discuss it with you

404
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,910
after I come back.

405
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,540
Sister.

406
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,670
Sister?

407
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,770
What are you doing?

408
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,190
Sister.

409
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,490
What are you doing?

410
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,670
Mingjie.

411
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,550
Don't move.

412
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,870
I'll treat you.

413
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,390
It's useless!

414
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,730
Sister.

415
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,680
I've told you.

416
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,610
It's useless...

417
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,360
Open your eyes.

418
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,110
All done.

419
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,470
Sister...

420
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,190
Mingjie.

421
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,350
You're alright now.

422
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,360
You're alright now.

423
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,350
Sister.

424
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,470
Sister.

425
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,830
Sister.

426
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,870
The poison has been removed.

427
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,410
I'll apply some snake gallbladder ointment on your eyes.

428
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,670
You'll recover completely by tomorrow.

429
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,930
Can you see the shadow?

430
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,420
"The Soul Devouring Powder is incurable."

431
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,000
That has been proven wrong.

432
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,110
Twenty years ago,

433
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,150
Grandmaster Lin Xia

434
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,210
agonized over this poison for a month

435
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,960
and died from overexhaustion.

436
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,830
But in the end,

437
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,630
she found a cure.

438
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,990
The poison clings to the skin

439
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,890
and spreads rapidly.

440
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,950
But one just needs to use silver needles

441
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,270
to force the poison together in one spot

442
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,610
and let someone who practices medicine

443
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,230
force the poison out with their body as a medium.

444
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,430
Then, it can be cured.

445
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,840
We don't even need

446
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,950
any medicine.

447
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,670
Then you...

448
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,790
I've been suffering from a cold disease for a long time.

449
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,250
Fire poison can't hurt me.

450
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,070
It will be fine.

451
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,910
Really?

452
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,310
Sister.

453
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,590
Sister.

454
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,340
Really?

455
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,090
Mingjie.

456
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,980
I won't let you die.

457
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,590
I won't let you be like Xuehuai

458
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,110
or the whole village

459
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,510
and die in front of me.

460
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,230
Mingjie.

461
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,680
This is the Red Fruit Jade Dew Pill.

462
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,390
You must have heard of it.

463
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,440
It'll help you feel better.

464
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,750
Mingjie.

465
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,050
Take care of yourself.

466
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,400
Don’t worry about the Doctrine Leader.

467
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,710
Your acupoints

468
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,030
will automatically be released

469
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,030
in 16 hours.

470
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,660
When your eyes

471
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,060
can see clearly,

472
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,830
you can leave on your own.

473
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,790
Mingjie.

474
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,790
Listen to me.

475
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,750
Don't kill anymore.

476
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,390
Don't worry.

477
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,470
I will be fine.

478
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,390
Sister.

479
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,390
Sister...

480
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,950
Don't go.

481
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Don't go, Sister.

482
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,830
Don't go...

483
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,310
Why?

484
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,210
Why is this happening?

485
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,110
Why is this happening?

486
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,070
No!

487
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,030
I don't want it!

488
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,370
I don't want anything else!

489
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,530
I only want you!

00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,990
You have never changed.

527
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:51,190
♫A lifetime with one person and one heart, all for a fleeting warmth♫

528
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:57,070
♫Bit by bit, day by day, year by year, fragments of memories♫

529
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:52,990
Chief Xue.

530
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,890
It’s getting late.

531
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,190
Lower your voice.

532
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,130
♫Gatherings, separations, joy and sorrow, the myriad facets of life♫

533
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:11,159
♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

534
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,230
Miao Shui's words

535
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,920
can't be trusted.

536
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,969
♫Bid farewell in the first wasteland♫

537
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,929
♫Only with flaws can it be considered complete♫

538
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,330
♫Bloom or wither, the snow is like me♫

539
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,179
♫Both fearless and brilliant♫

540
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,949
Good boy.

541
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,230
Go to sleep.

542
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:44,250
♫Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destiny♫

543
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,590
When you wake up,

544
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,469
everything will be fine.

545
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,550
♫The past is like an unbearable illusion, yet I remain resolute♫

546
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,560
Everything will be fine.

547
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,949
Sister...

548
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,960
Go to sleep.

549
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,440
♫Toasts exchanged, the world has changed♫

550
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,580
Don't go...

551
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:04,480
♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

552
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:15,020
♫No regrets even when looking back♫

553
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,510
You took too long,

554
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,150
Chief Xue,

555
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,390
Let us

556
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,520
now discuss

557
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,460
how to deal with things tomorrow.

558
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,160
Don’t worry, Doctrine Leader.

559
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,990
After Chief Xue’s treatment tomorrow,

560
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,320
you will fully recover.

561
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,920
But after I fully recover,

562
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,990
I wonder if

563
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,590
we should

564
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,900
keep Miao Shui or not.

565
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,460
As far as I know,

566
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,400
on the day Eye rebelled,

567
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,870
Miao Shui killed

568
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,390
Miao Huo, who was also rebelling,

569
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,450
and protected you.

570
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,710
I think...

571
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,550
Feng.

572
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,550
You used to obey orders

573
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,240
and never asked why.

574
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,070
I'm just...

575
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,150
Miao Shui

576
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,220
is too smart.

577
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,270
We have to guard against her.

578
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,990
Do you know?

579
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,990
When Eye was subdued,

580
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,480
he ratted on Miao Shui too.

581
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,880
Although she didn't admit it,

582
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,190
we cannot be sure that her loyalty that day

583
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,590
was not made based on

584
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,540
the development of the situation.

585
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,340
I didn’t kill her that day

586
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,390
because

587
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,820
you were not by my side.

588
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,960
But after I recover,

589
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,670
Miao Shui should be disposed of.

590
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,400
I understand.

591
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,030
During the treatment tomorrow,

592
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,390
the most important thing for you

593
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,800
is to stay by my side

594
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,150
and never leave me.

595
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,190
Feng.

596
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,550
You have always been

597
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,080
the person I trust the most.

598
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,270
I will definitely protect you.

599
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,750
In Yuan Yi Palace,

600
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,460
everyone is scheming against

601
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,870
each other.

602
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,700
It's my turn to make a move.

603
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Last question.

604
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,530
Aren't you afraid of death?

605
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,560
Yes.

606
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,470
But there's something scarier than death.

607
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:12,990
Okay.

608
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,820
Act according to plan tomorrow.

609
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,770
She's not bad.

610
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,700
I seem to have gotten

611
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,450
a good partner for myself.

612
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,390
Since the deal is over,

613
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,200
you should eat him.

614
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,470
Go.

615
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,470
Gut-rupturing herb?

616
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,920
Xue Ziye.

617
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,060
You are really something.

618
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,030
I'm spent.

619
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,670
I can't move anymore.

620
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,670
Let's take a rest here.

621
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,960
Fourth Brother.

622
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,800
Hold on a little longer.

623
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,350
Seven.

624
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,110
Listen to Four

625
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,040
and take a break.

626
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,310
Even if a person can go on,

627
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,030
the horse can't go on much further.

628
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,510
Besides, the road to the north

629
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,550
is getting colder.

630
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,750
It's hard to walk too.

631
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,960
Let's rest for tonight

632
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
to travel well tomorrow.

633
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,630
Then let's take a night off

634
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,970
and leave tomorrow.

635
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,270
Great.

636
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,470
Take a rest.

637
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,070
Sir,

638
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,110
how many are with you?

639
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,090
Do you need anything?

640
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,580
Seven.

641
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,550
Just

642
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,070
get us some food and drinks.

643
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,150
Okay. Have a seat.

644
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,070
Wait a moment.

645
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,680
[Yueya Vale Posthouse]

646
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,750
She should have

647
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,110
received my letter.

648
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,870
I wonder if she will

649
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,920
wait for me under that plum tree.

650
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,530
Fifth Brother.

651
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,200
Why are you still up?

652
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,570
I can't sleep well.

653
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,340
I didn't see you in the room,

654
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:34,830
so I thought you must be

655
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,760
drinking alone.

656
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,350
Have a sip.

657
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,290
Qingran told me to drink less.

658
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,870
Got it.

659
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,350
Seven.

660
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,210
Are you in such a hurry

661
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,990
because of Qingran's disciple?

662
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,750
Remember to bury a pot of Laughing at the World

663
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,880
under the plum tree.

664
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,830
Let's drink together when I'm back.

665
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,910
I'll surely beat you.

666
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,110
I promised her.

667
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,670
When the wine has aged,

668
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,860
I'll go back and drink with her.
