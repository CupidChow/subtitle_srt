you've been looking at this letter for a while.

30
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,270
Have you noticed anything suspicious?

31

This letter

32
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,880
is indeed in Seven's handwriting.

33
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,030
It's true that it's in Seventh Brother's handwriting.

34
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,470
But Seventh Brother isn't stupid.

35
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,130
If he really intended to kill,

36
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,030
why would he leave a letter

37
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,630
and bring trouble upon himself?

38
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,420
Even if this letter

39
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,829
was left by Seventh Brother,

40
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,950

that he has the Azure Phoenix Flower.

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,990
It doesn't prove

43
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,050
that he killed him.

44
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,670

that you suspect Seventh Brother?

better than anyone.

56

There's no way he could have done this.

60
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,790
It was definitely not caused by Dark Soul Sword.

that the people from White Cloud Palace have already

tracked down Seventh Brother's whereabouts

Right before Mr. Qin died,

70
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,490
he made it clear

71
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,950
that the killer was Seven.

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,990
Chief Lin is convinced it was Seven.

73
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,050
With just this bit of evidence,

74
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,800
how do you expect him to listen to your explanation?

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,060
Then what should we do?

76
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,000
You set off immediately to catch up with them.

77

Once you arrive at the Apothecary Valley,

78

try to hold back Chief Lin temporarily

79
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,990
to prevent him from confronting Seven directly.

80
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,990

82

Well, Fourth Brother,

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,190
where do you plan to start your investigation?

84
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,190
Don't say so much.

The ancestral pulse case states that

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,670
there was no cure for this condition at the time,

91
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,400
and we could only prescribe medication to alleviate the pain.

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,470
However, a patient with the same condition

93
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,870
that I treated last month

94
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,840
has recovered using both acupuncture and medicine.

95
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,450
Therefore, similar difficult cases

96
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,680
can also be cured with this approach.

But I have found another clue.

to obtain the Azure Phoenix Flower?

142
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,670
I originally thought that when I arrived in Yangzhou,

143
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,420
it would take at least half a month

144

to get news about the Azure Phoenix Flower.

145
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,770
I didn't expect

146
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,310

that the Azure Phoenix Flower was right in Linglong Flower Realm.

148

What kind of place is Linglong Flower Realm?

149
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,950
It's a place where men go for entertainment.

As a man of integrity,

151
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,430
how could I go to such a place?

You took the Azure Phoenix Flower from White Cloud Palace.

Do you think they will just let it go?

165
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,350
I will definitely find another opportunity

166
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,670
to personally go to White Cloud Palace and apologize.

167

Chief, bad news!

168

Some people broke in!

169
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,720
It's probably trouble you caused.

170
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,950
I can handle this myself.

171
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,030
Wait.

172
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,510
Later,

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,520
will inevitably have a fierce battle.

175
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,230
If you unfortunately die…

176
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,760
Don't worry.

177
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,270
After all, we have experienced

178
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,630
a near-death night together.

179
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,350
I will handle your remains

180
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,150
and won't let you become a wandering ghost.

181
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,630
It's just that

182
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,650
who is going to pay back the debts

183
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,290
you owe me?

184
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,480
I will try not to trouble you

185
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,570
and will pay the debts myself.

186
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,830
I originally had no intention to get involved.

187
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,650
But you're going to start a conflict

188
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,790
at the entrance of our Apothecary Valley.

189
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,650
Won't that damage my reputation?

190
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,830
So you mean...

191
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,690
Xiao Cheng,

192
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,080
open the valley gate

193
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,230
and treat them with courtesy.

194
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,670
Yes!

195
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,150
Chief Lin.

196
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,950
I presume

197
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,810
you are Chief Lin of White Cloud Palace, right?

198
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,160
I am Lin Tianbao.

199
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,550
I apologize for the disturbance caused by

200
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,480
my coming today.

201
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,530
Greetings, Chief Lin.

202
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,070
Is your grand presence here with so many people

203
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,930
for the Azure Phoenix Flower?

204
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,950
Chief Xue, since you are being so straightforward,

205
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,550
I won't beat around the bush.

206
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,670
Huo Zhanbai snatched the Azure Phoenix Flower

207
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,870
and brought it to the Apothecary Valley.

208
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,630
Chief Xue,

209
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,930
do you know the reason?

210
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,840
If the Apothecary Valley is involved,

211
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,630
I will hold you accountable as well.

212
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,230
Chief Lin.

213
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,590
Chief Lin,

214
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,960
it was indeed my fault for privately taking

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,950
the Azure Phoenix Flower from your sect.

216
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,830
But it has nothing to do with Chief Xue.

217
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,930
Please don't make things difficult for her.

218
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,870
Can a mere few words of apology

219
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,820
absolve you of the crime of murder?

220
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,990
Murder?

221
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,990
You killed and took the flower.

222
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,980
I'll make you pay with your life.

223
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,730
I admit to taking the flower.

224
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,590
But why do you accuse me of murder?

225
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,950
Are you saying...

226
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,920
that Qin Tiancheng is dead?

227
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,000
You're still playing innocent here?

228
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,530
You killed Tiancheng.

229
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
The entire White Cloud Palace

230
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,920
will never let you go.

231
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,110
No wonder there's such a big commotion.

232
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,590
Chief Lin,

233
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,910
I did take the Azure Phoenix Flower.

234
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,500
But I have never killed anyone.

235
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,150
Is there perhaps

236
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,310
some misunderstanding?

237
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,440
Misunderstanding?

238
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,470
What misunderstanding could there be?

239
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,580
If Tiancheng was still alive

240
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,990
after you took the flower,

241
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,540
why would anyone else want to kill him?

242
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,470
If it wasn't you,

243
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,270
then who else could it be?

244
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Seventh Brother,

245
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,310
what exactly happened

246
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,710
when you took the flower?

247
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,470
At that time, I saw Qin Tiancheng

248
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,670
about to give the Azure Phoenix Flower

249
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,600
to Envoy Miao Huo of Yuan Yi Palace.

250
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,350
After

251
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,300
I got the flower,

252
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,160
I left Linglong Flower Realm.

253
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,030
Are there any witnesses?

254
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,630
Besides the people from Yuan Yi Palace,

255
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,000
there are no witnesses.

256
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,950
No witnesses?

257
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,630
Are you telling me that just because of

258
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,070
your reputation in the martial world,

259
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,740
I should believe

260
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,000
your one-sided story?

261
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,290
Everything I said is true.

262
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,020
There are no falsehoods.

263
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,750
Those are just empty words.

264
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,950
Who would believe you?

265
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,750
I believe you.

266
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,670
I know you are not someone

267
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,930
who indiscriminately kills innocents.

268
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,110
However, the Apothecary Valley

269
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,050
never gets involved in the affairs of the martial world.

270
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,710
This matter

271
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,090
needs to be resolved by yourself.

272
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,830
Seventh Brother.

273
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,790
I believe you too.

274
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,110
Mr. Lin,

275
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,350
since you are so certain that I killed him,

276
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,440
then let me ask you:

277
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,910
why did I leave a note to Xingzhi,

278
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,030
telling him that I took the Azure Phoenix Flower?

279
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,990
Wouldn't that be inviting trouble upon myself?

280
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,390
These were all your tricks to obscure the truth.

281
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,870
Fine.

282
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,910
The people from Yuan Yi Palace also wanted to take the flower.

283
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,570
Everyone present knows this.

284
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,800
Why do you not suspect

285
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,840
that they were the ones who killed him

286
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,370
and are so certain it was me?

287
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
Don't try to divert attention.

288
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,550
Before Tiancheng passed away,

289
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,310
he personally identified you as the murderer.

290
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,970
The evidence is irrefutable.

291
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,670
He personally identified me?

292
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,110
Yes.

293
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,910
At that time, Xia Qianyu

294
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,470
and Zhou Xingzhi were both present

295
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,950
and witnessed it with their own eyes.

296
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,680
How can you argue against that?

297
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,760
Apart from the deceased's testimony,

298
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,400
is there any other evidence

299
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,630
that proves it was me?

300
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,790
Aren't these considered evidence?

301
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,270
Yes.

302
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,470
But these are still not enough.

303
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,110
Can you confirm the location, shape,

304
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,110
and size of the wound on the deceased?

305
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,710
Were there any signs of poisoning?

306
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,010
Was the fatal blow dealt by a sword or something else?

307
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,800
Was the wound

308
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,950
caused by my sword?

309
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,590
Chief Lin, can you confirm all of these?

310
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,730
Tiancheng's wound is under his ribs.

311
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,950
The sword wound is indeed not fatal.

312
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,750
He died from excessive blood loss.

313
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,950
This is the key point.

314
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,070
Mr. Lin,

315
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,930
please think about it.

316
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,580
If I had intended to kill him,

317
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,320
I certainly wouldn't have left any evidence

318
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,980
that could lead you back to me.

319
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,650
And I wouldn't have left any opportunity

320
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,510
for Qin Tiancheng to identify me.

321
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,630
Furthermore, my Fourth Brother

322
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,960
has examined the wound.

323
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,550
He said it was not caused by Dark Soul Sword.

324
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,630
Given this,

325
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,750
we need to consider this matter further.

326
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,220
Consider further?

327
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,710
Tiancheng has already been buried.

328
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,570
Are you suggesting I open the coffin for an autopsy?

329
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,750
Chief Xue,

330
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,590
I have always respected the Apothecary Valley.

331
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,280
I know

332
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,970
you have been deceived by him,

333
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,710
so I won't hold you accountable.

334
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,430
But I must ask that the Apothecary Valley

335
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,160
refrain from interfering in the affairs of our White Cloud Palace.

336
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,750
So what if you want

337
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,600
to hold me accountable?

338
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,630
I'm offering friendly advice.

339
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,880
If you don't listen,

340
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,330
don't blame me for turning hostile.

341
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,710
You see,

342
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,960
I am the type who is easily provoked.

343
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,620
The more you try to stop me from doing something,

344
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,490
the more I will insist on doing it.

345
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
So, are you saying

346
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,970
that for Huo Zhanbai,

347
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,340
you will make an exception and interfere

348
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,150
in the affairs of the martial world?

349
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,950
That's right.

350
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,270
Today, I insist on protecting this person.

351
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,710
What can you do about it?

352
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,590
Today, I'll see who dares

353
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,750
to act recklessly in the Apothecary Valley!

354
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,150
You...

355
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,790
Chief Xue,

356
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,830
there are rumors in the martial world

357
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,290
that you like pretty boys.

358
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,470
Are you so protective of him

359
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,670
because you like him?

360
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,310
Chief Lin, please focus on the matter at hand

361
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,970
and do not be rude to Chief Xue.

362
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,360
Since the whole story has been explained,

363
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,270
why not leave this matter

364
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,030
to our Sword Sect?

365
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,890
Leave it to you?

366
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,750
Who knows if the people from the Sword Sect

367
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,990
will collude with each other?

368
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,470
Shut up!

369
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,030
How dare you slander the Sword Sect so casually?

370
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,430
You...

371
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,830
Chief Nangong

372
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,430
is a close friend of mine for many years.

373
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,690
I trust his character.

374
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,350
However, Huo Zhanbai first

375
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,950
deliberately lured me away,

376
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
then snatched the Azure Phoenix Flower

377
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,940
and killed Tiancheng.

378
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,150
Today,

379
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,480
I will not let you go.

380
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,390
Seventh Brother!

381
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,069
Chief Lin,

382
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,640
this matter is not yet settled.

383
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,260
How can you act so ruthlessly?

384
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,060
He wants to prove his innocence.

385
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,390
Do not act rashly.

386
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
Why didn't you dodge?

387
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
I didn't kill him.

388
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,410
Why should I dodge?

389
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,270
Chief Lin,

390
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,480
do you want to continue?

391
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,360
What's going on?

392
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,470
Why are there two Huo Zhanbais?

393
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,680
Something's wrong.

394
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,370
Chief Lin.

395
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,150
Who are you?

396
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,280
Fourth Brother?

397
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,220
Why are there two Huo Zhanbais?

398
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,430
It's me.

399
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,310
Chief Lin.

400
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,030
Disguise technique?

401
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,190
After we parted that day,

402
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,590
I returned to Linglong Flower Realm.

403
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,160
Who is it?

404
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,740
Miss Liu?

405
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,020
Did you come here

406
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,150
about Mr. Huo?

407
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,950
The murderer is not Mr. Huo.

408
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,390
I saw Mr. Huo twice today.

409
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,310
The first time was at 6 p.m.

410
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,200
I remember it very clearly.

411
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,710
I was playing music.

412
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,520
When he walked in and saw me,

413
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,790
he nodded to me politely

414
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,910
and then

415
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,590
went upstairs.

416
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,910
The second time was at 7 p.m.,

417
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,950
but he was completely different,

418
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,210
very cold and distant.

419
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,870
I found it strange at the time

420
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,710
that his demeanor had changed so suddenly.

421
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,510
Now it seems

422
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,470
the person I saw the second time

423
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,950
was not Mr. Huo at all.

424
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,390
So

425
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,310
where did you find these?

426
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,000
After the murder occurred,

427
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,240
I felt something was off,

428
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,310
so I started looking for clues.

429
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,480
I found these in the back alley.

430
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,780
It seems

431
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,990
someone framed him.

432
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,450
Unfortunately, I am just a weak woman

433
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,310
and could only find these clues.

434
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,590
I don't know

435
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,190
if they can help Mr. Huo.

436
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,070
Miss Liu, you're being too modest.

437
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,550
This is a great help.

438
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,720
Fourth Brother,

439
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,070
thank you.

440
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,790
You don't need to thank me.

441
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,630
Just take care of your injuries.

442
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,370
I don't want Sword Sect

443
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,640
to be disgraced because of you.

444
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,570
Fourth Brother.

445
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,670
For now,

446
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,100
I'll trust you.

447
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,390
But that doesn't mean

448
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,870
you're not the murderer.

449
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,910
I will investigate this thoroughly.

450
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,630
If I find out

451
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,310
you've been hiding anything from me,

452
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,240
I will not let you

453
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,270
off the hook, no matter where you go.

454
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,830
Sir.

455
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,350
I have one more favor to ask of you.

456
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,210
I'm listening.

457
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,400
I took the Azure Phoenix Flower

458
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,830
not for myself,

459
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,610
but for my Sixth Brother's child.

460
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,480
My Sixth Brother's child is seriously ill

461
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,490
and needs the Azure Phoenix Flower to save his life.

462
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,950
Chief Lin, could you please

463
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,810
give me the Azure Phoenix Flower?

464
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,310
In the future, if your White Cloud Palace

465
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,310
needs my help,

466
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,710
I, Seven,

467
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,430
will not hesitate

468
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,750
to go through fire and water for you.

469
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,880
Your Sixth Brother?

470
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,600
Xu Chonghua?

471
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,760
Exactly.

472
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,230
Chief Lin,

473
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,450
now, do you understand

474
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,400
why Seven hurried back to the Apothecary Valley

475
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,130
right after he took the flower?

476
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,070
For a deceased friend's child,

477
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,590
he was willing to risk his life to seize the flower.

478
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,790
He can be considered a chivalrous person.

479
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,250
You took the Azure Phoenix Flower

480
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,410
to save that child,

481
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
which was indeed a noble act.

482
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,690
It's much better than it falling into

483
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,040
the hands of those with ill intentions

484
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,700
and aiding their wrongdoing.

485
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,850
Thank you, Sir.

486
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,590
I know that this matter arose because of me.

487
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,630
After I finish gathering the medicine,

488
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,760
I will surely find out

489
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,090
the murderer of Mr. Qin,

490
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,040
restoring justice to the White Cloud Palace.

491
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,830
This matter involves Yuan Yi Palace,

492
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,360
so it may not be that simple.

493
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,710
Chief Lin,

494
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,910
why don't you come back to the Sword Sect with me

495
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,040
to discuss this matter with our chief?

496
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,710
Very well.

497
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,630
Chief Xue,

498
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,790
people in the martial world

499
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,310
all say you have an eccentric personality.

500
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,430
But upon meeting you this time,

501
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,230
I found that you are actually a courageous and righteous person.

502
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,030
I admire that.

503
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,000
Sorry for offending you during our visit

504
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,750
to the Apothecary Valley this time.

505
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,350
Farewell.

506
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,770
You got injured after all.

507
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
Fortunately, it's not serious.

508
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,710
Let's go to the medicine hut.

509
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,640
Fourth Brother,

510
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,320
let's go.

511
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,870
Eight,

512
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,570
you go back first

513
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,470
and tell the chief

514
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,290
that I'll stay here

515
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,610
for a few more days.

516
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,500
Do you think you can enter the Apothecary Valley

517
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,390
as you please?

518
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,510
You must have the Fate-Reversal Token

519
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,910
and pay a fee of 100,000 coins for the consultation.

520
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,330
Although I don't have the Fate-Reversal Token,

521
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,450
I have money.

522
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,070
I'll cover Seven's

523
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,490
medical expenses.

524
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,800
Shuang Hong, I've left it here.

525
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,680
You owe me another debt for the treatment now.

526
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,250
Just put it on my tab.

527
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,110
You drank this without even asking

528
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,750
what it is?

529
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,750
Chief Xue, if you wanted to harm me,

530
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,150
I would've died long ago.

531
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,350
Thank you.

532
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,690
♫Who is brewing the medicine, as the fragrance slowly filters through the window?♫

533
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,370
♫You lower your gaze, grinding herbs, your hand gently brushing my wound♫

534
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,200
♫Following your eyes, I see the flowers fall softly into my palm♫

♫I wish to speak, yet my thoughts remain unspoken♫

♫The night is long, and you adorn yourself behind the gauze♫

539

Chief.

540
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,320
He's lost too much blood.

541
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,870
Go and make a bowl of Eight Treasures Soup.

542
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,630
♫The swaying shadows of the trees stir my heart♫

543
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,660
Yes.

Hell.

♫Though fate is uncertain, I shall always remember your face♫

559
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,170
would've been useless by now.

560
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,470
Shut up.

561
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,610
Stay still.

562
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,510
The effect of the anesthetic powder has just worn off.

563
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,910
You might feel some pain.

564
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,050
Try to bear with it.

565
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,650

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,590
Nothing.

584
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,270
I just want to ask,

585
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,630
when will my injury heal?

586
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,990
This time,

587
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,040
your shoulder bone is injured.

588
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,920
This hole

589
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,480
will need at least three months of rest

590
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,600
here in the valley.

591
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,230
Three months?

592
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,830
Is there any way to heal faster?

593
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,670
It's...

594
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,010
What are you doing?

595
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,790
How about letting Ms. Shuang Hong

596
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,550
treat me?

597
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,720
Chief Xue, don't you need

598
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,030
the Fate-Reversal Token and the consultation fee

599
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,360
to treat me personally?

600
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,900
I've already seen your whole body.

601
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,880
Why are you

602
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,370
suddenly feeling shy now?

603
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,430
Don't worry.

604
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,870
In my eyes,

605
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,320
you're no different from a bronze statue.

606
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,990
What?

607
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,520
Even a bronze statue can feel pain?

608
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,130
You were too rough in treating me.

609
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,640
Someone was too harsh with you.

610
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,550
Someone deliberately set you up.

611
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,150
You should really reflect on

612
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,830
why you have so many enemies.

613
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,230
Perhaps

614
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,670
I'm not the target in this matter.

615
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,600
What do you mean?

616
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,430
Logically,

617
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,840
since Qin Tiancheng has allied with Yuan Yi Palace,

618
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,760
Yuan Yi Palace

619
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,270
certainly wouldn't have killed him.

620
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,110
But it's possible

621
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,630
they might have done the opposite

622
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,710
to deliberately distance themselves.

623
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,830
After all, with Qin Tiancheng dead,

624
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,990
the Seven-Star Sword Formation

625
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,320
of the White Cloud Palace would be broken.

626
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,850
But why did that person

627
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,450
disguise themselves as you?

628
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,150
I don't know.

629
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,600
After all, besides the people of the Apothecary Valley,

630
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,120
no one knew about my plan

631
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,230
to obtain the Azure Phoenix Flower.

632
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,960
You just barely escaped death,

633
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,640
and yet you actually have the energy

634
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,900
to talk nonsense here?

635
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,090
Lie down.

636
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,190
Ladies,

637
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,510
it's been quite a while.

638
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,950
How's my Seventh Brother doing?

639
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,020
The chief hasn't come out yet.

640
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,390
We don't know either.

641
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,890
You said you'd pay Mr. Huo's treatment fee.

642
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,690
Have you paid?

643
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,310
As long as my Seventh Brother is fine,

644
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,110
I'll gladly pay the fee right away.

645
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,390
As long as you pay the fee,

646
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,320
we can guarantee Mr. Huo's safety.

647
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
Miss,

648
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,930
you really are quick-witted.

649
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,130
It seems that in the Apothecary Valley,

650
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,460
it's not just Chief Xue,

651
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,850
but everyone here is quite interesting.

652
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,800
Feng Lyu,

653
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,880
since he's a friend of Mr. Seven,

654
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
stop teasing him.

655
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,180
Mr. Seven is currently fine.

656
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,170
He just needs some time

657
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,010
to recover.

658
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,500
There is one more thing

659
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,770
I'd like to ask you.

660
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,920
Please go ahead.

661
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,110
Just now, Seven said

662
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,190
he took the Azure Phoenix Flower

663
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,670
for Xu Chonghua's child.

664
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,510
Is that true?

665
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,390
Yes.

666
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,130
For the past few years, Mr. Seven

667
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,630
has been searching for medicine for Mo.

668
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,830
When was the first time he entered the valley?

669
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,160
Was it around New Year's Eve two years ago?

670
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,270
Yes.

671
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,190
So,

672
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,930
he started from that time.

673
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,190
Back then, the chief

674
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,910
gave a prescription that required five ingredients.

675
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,530
Including the Seven-Leaf Fungus and the Azure Phoenix Flower,

676
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,490
Mr. Huo has already obtained

677
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,170
two of them.

678
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,880
The Seven-Leaf Fungus and Azure Phoenix Flower

679
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,270
are already extremely rare medicinal ingredients,

680
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,270
yet they are only two of the ones in the prescription?

681
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,310
There's also the Dragon's Tongue

682
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
from the sheer cliffs of Mount Jun in Dongting,

683
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,990
the Snow Poppy from Qingling Snow Mountain,

684
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,510
and the Millennial Cold Dragon Blood Pearl.

685
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,840
These five ingredients

686
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,150
are all rare

687
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,410
and scattered across different places.

688
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,670
To gather them,

689
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,710
one must risk their life.

690
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,390
I had no idea

691
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,590
he's been doing this.

692
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,470
Aren't both of you

693
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,790
one of the seven disciples of the Sword Sect?

694
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,650
How could you not know about this?

695
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,550
Seven.

696
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,070
Seven!

697
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:29,920
Seven.

698
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,510
Seven.

699
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,390
I'm sorry.

700
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:34,960
Seven,

701
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,910
you've been risking your life

702
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,270
searching for medicinal ingredients for Mo.

703
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

704
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,830
If I hadn't come

705
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,700
to the Apothecary Valley today,

706
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,090
I still wouldn't know.

707
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,310
I thought

708
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,470
you didn't care about the matter of Chonghua at all.

709
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,010
I even treated you coldly.

710
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,730
I really...

711
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,840
Fourth Brother,

712
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,880
what good would it do to tell you?

713
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,560
Sixth Brother wouldn't come back to life.

714
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,910
I can only do my best

715
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,950
to keep Mo alive.

716
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,050
After all, Sixth Brother died by my hand.

717
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,580
I'd rather you hate me.

718
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,720
My good brother.

719
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,820
With your shoulder bone injured

720
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,680
and your right arm affected,

721
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,190
you shouldn't move too much.

722
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,270
You need someone to take good care of you.

723
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,830
Shuang Hong.

724
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,430
I'll do it!

725
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,600
I'll take care of him.

726
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,830
Fourth Brother, you just came to the Apothecary Valley.

727
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,790
Why don't we let Ms. Shuang Hong and her companions

728
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,190
do it?

729
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,590
There's no need to trouble the girls in the valley.

730
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,190
Seven,

731
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,740
trust me. I can do this.

732
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,890
Can you handle it?

733
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,530
I can.

734
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,910
Alright then.

735
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,560
Chief Xue, please wait.

736
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,430
I haven't had the chance to introduce myself yet.

737
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,100
I am Xia Qianyu, the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect

738
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,030
and the only son of the Huashan Sect leader.

739
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,420
In the martial world, I'm known by the name

740
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,920
White Feather Sword.

741
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,270
I have long heard of you.

742
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,830
It is truly a fateful encounter

743
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,670
to meet you today.

744
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,190
Drink the medicine

745
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,050
while it's hot.

746
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:29,710
Here.

747
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,110
Drink your medicine.

748
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,429
Let me feed you. Here.

749
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,020
I can do it myself.

750
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,350
I can do it myself!

751
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,150
It's alright.

752
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,360
I'll treat you to a drink tonight.

753
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,090
Sounds good.

754
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,270
Here.

755
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,870
Come on.

756
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,440
Fourth Brother.

757
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,190
this time you should raise your glass with me, right?

758
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,790
Of course.

759
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,900
Here.

760
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,270
Let me.

761
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,590
You're injured.

762
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,430
By the way, Fourth Brother,

763
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,160
there's another thing I want to discuss with you.

764
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,400
Ever since the Yuan Yi Palace was expelled

765
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,900
from the Central Plains by the Sword Sect,

766
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,990
the martial world has been peaceful

767
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,850
for many years.

768
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,430
But this incident with the White Cloud Palace

769
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,760
doesn't seem so simple.

770
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,830
I have the same feeling.

771
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,830
Over these years,

772
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,270
the eight disciples have gradually separated.

773
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,790
Eldest Brother hasn't recovered from his old injuries

774
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,990
and has been resting.

775
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,270
Second Brother is engrossed in martial arts,

776
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,270
studying sword techniques day and night.

777
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,020
Third Brother has started a family.

778
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,790
Five left without a word.

779
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,270
And Six…

780
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,370
And you have been searching for medicine for Mo.

781
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,250
Among us brothers,

782
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,430
only I and Eight

783
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,030
can be dispatched at any time

784
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,630
to go out and handle matters.

785
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,030
The chief

786
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,320
has been quite worried about this.

787
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,240
Fourth Brother,

788
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,210
it was my...

789
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,750
I'm saying this

790
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,740
not to make you

791
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,320
put on a look

792
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,720
of guilt and self-blame.

793
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,550
First,

794
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,310
your search for medicine for Mo

795
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,510
is an act of chivalry,

796
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,950
which deserves respect.

797
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,500
Second,

798
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,840
what difference does it make

799
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,430
if there's one more person in the Sword Sect?

800
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,070
You're not an immortal.

801
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,350
You can't handle

802
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,590
every issue at once.

803
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,070
Third,

804
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,620
I know you too well.

805
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,560
If you were to encounter

806
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,450
any injustice,

807
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,690
with your temperament,

808
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,790
you would be the first to rush out

809
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,050
and fight for justice.

810
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,030
So,

811
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,150
just focus on finding medicine for Mo.

812
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,870
Leave the affairs in the Sword Sect

813
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,630
to us.

814
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,630
I've never seen you

815
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,830
so serious before.

816
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,710
Come on, Fourth Brother,

817
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,070
a toast to you.

818
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,770
Cheers.

819
00:36:59,390 --> 00:36:59,990
Cool!

820
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,510
Let me.

821
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,950
We just agreed on this. Let me.

822
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,590
It's fine.

823
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,430
It's fine. This time, you must let me pour the wine.

824
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,470
But you're injured.

825
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,150
It's fine.

826
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,630
Chief, you truly guessed right.

827
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,160
Mr. Huo is indeed drinking.

828
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,110
And he's even drinking openly

829
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,570
outside the medicine hut.

830
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,350
Let him drink.

831
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,910
Over these years,

832
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,830
he's been traveling all over the world.

833
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,550
It's not easy for him to sit down with his brother

834
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,680
and have a good chat.

835
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,090
[Yuan Yi Palace]

836
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,280
Long live the Doctrine Leader.

837
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,670
With Qin Tiancheng dead,

838
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,030
the Seven Star Sword Formation of the White Cloud Palace

839
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,560
is missing a key component.

840
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,190
As a result,

841
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,970
the White Cloud Palace

842
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,320
is like a trapped beast.

843
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,010
Its complete destruction

844
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,290
is only a matter of time.

845
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,730
Congratulations, Doctrine Leader.

846
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,750
I sent you there for two reasons.

847
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,980
First, to kill Qin Tiancheng.

848
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,030
Second,

849
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,440
to frame the Sword Sect

850
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,710
for the murder,

851
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,310
inciting conflict between the Sword Sect

852
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,790
and White Cloud Palace

853
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,270
and disturbing the balance of the martial world in the Central Plains.

854
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,470
You've accomplished

855
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,440
these two important tasks.

856
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,910
Well done.

857
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,510
However,

858
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,960
it seems the process of completing the mission

859
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,210
didn't go so smoothly, did it?

860
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,710
Making contact with Qin Tiancheng

861
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,120
and then taking the chance to kill him—

862
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
these tasks

863
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,910
were supposed to be handled by you, Miao Huo, weren't they?

864
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,830
So why did Eye handle them?

865
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,150
What's the story here?

866
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Doctrine Leader,

867
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,810
it was all that fake father Huo Zhanbai's

868
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,630
interference.

869
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,430
Otherwise, I—

870
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,910
your humble servant—

871
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,590
would have killed him long ago.

872
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,110
There would be no need for him at all.

873
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,670
Miao Huo,

874
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,840
Miao Huo, what do you mean by this?

875
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,390
Killing him.

876
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,110
I thought you were going to tell me

877
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,760
that you were provoked by Huo Zhanbai,

878
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,270
which is why you chased after him

879
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,350
and ultimately forgot the important mission.

880
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,900
I was wrong.

881
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,250
please spare me, Doctrine Leader.

882
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,150
Miao Huo,

883
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,470
you

884
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,120
really should be thanking Eye.

885
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,550
If it weren't for him,

886
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,330
you wouldn't even

887
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,370
be here today.

888
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,830
Yes.

889
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,170
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

890
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,190
Eye.

891
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,790
In the matter in Yangzhou,

892
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,050
you acted decisively.

893
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,670
Well done.

894
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:52,830
Come.

895
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,550
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

896
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,350
I had foreseen

897
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,570
that Miao Huo, being reckless,

898
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,170
would easily make mistakes.

899
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,920
That's why I sent you.

900
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,680
As expected,

901
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,330
you didn't disappoint me.

902
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,840
It's all thanks to your trust and guidance.

903
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,550
Tell me.

904
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,760
What reward do you want?

905
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,320
I have no other desires.

906
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,030
In that case,

907
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,850
according to the rules of our palace,

908
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,190
go to the Celestial Paradise

909
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,430
and enjoy yourself.

910
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,890
You may do as you please

911
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,990
with anyone inside.

912
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,470
Don't think I'll thank you

913
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,110
just because you didn't snitch.

914
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,750
I'm telling you.

915
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,550
Even if the Doctrine Leader hadn't sent you to Yangzhou,

916
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,430
I could have completed the mission myself.

917
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,750
The reward you received today

918
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,010
should have been mine!

919
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,810
I've already told you,

920
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,910
I just find you unnecessary.

921
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:15,830
What?

922
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,630
You're dispensable,

923
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,390
not worth my effort.

924
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,750
Let go.

925
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,110
I find your clothes dirty.

926
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,560
You brat,

927
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,710
I'm at least

928
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,640
a person, right?

929
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,350
You've barely learned to walk

930
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,660
and you dare bark at me?

931
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,230
Why are you two arguing?

932
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,920
Why are you everywhere?

933
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:43,990
Eye,

934
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,630
our Envoy Miao Huo

935
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,990
has a bad temper.

936
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,320
Please be patient with him.

937
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,200
Where are you going?

938
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,230
The Doctrine Leader has told me

939
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,360
to take you to the Celestial Paradise.

940
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,710
Do you know what kind of place

941
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,280
the Celestial Paradise is?

942
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,280
I don't know,

943
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,440
and I don't want to know.

944
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,770
Why act so high and mighty?

945
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,310
Aren't you even

946
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,310
a little curious?

947
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,670
This is the most indulgent and decadent place

948
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,390
in the world.

949
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,800
Everyone who has been here

950
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,030
becomes captivated and never wants to leave.

951
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,750
You've done a great service today,

952
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,430
and the Doctrine Leader is rewarding you

953
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,490
with a chance to enjoy yourself here.

954
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,990
You'd better be careful

955
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,150
and not let your soul

956
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,390
be taken away by what's inside.
