The fourth year of Huijia…

Yes, the fourth year of Huijia.

Moreover, the previous chief of the Moon Sect

once had plans

Neat trick, Chief Jing.

84
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,080
When you treated me yesterday,

85
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,200
I had a vague feeling that something was wrong.

86

Sure enough, you do have ulterior motives.

87

The one who poisoned me

88
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,520
and lured me into the valley

89
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,070
must be you.

90
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,830
Right.

91
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,100
I tried

92
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,240
various ways

93
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,390
to make you take a slow-acting poison.

94
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,870
The symptoms were not noticeable at first,

95
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,430
but as time passed,

96
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,170
the potency of the poison increased.

97
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,430
I estimated the time when the poison would take effect

98
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,520
and then had someone

99
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,230
put the Fate-Reversal Token

100
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,990
around Lingjiu Mountain.

101
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,680
Then

102
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,700
it fell into your hands seemingly by chance.

103
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,090
Where's the antidote?

104
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,320
You eat it first.

105
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,520
Who on earth are you?

106
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,710
Why are you so concerned

107
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,170
about the massacre at the Mo Family Village?

108
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,390
I survived

109
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,260
that massacre.

110
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,920
The villagers of the Mo Family Village

111
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,430
were brutally slaughtered

112
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,470
in that massacre.

113
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,690
I want to know the truth

114
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,280
and seek justice for those villagers.

115
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,950
I know,

116
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,790
at this point,

117
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,830
you won't spare me.

118
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,670
I only wish

119
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,260
that before I die,

120
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,750
I could learn the truth about that tragedy.

121
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,780
Then,

122
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,330
I can die without regrets.

123
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,130
The massacre at the Mo Family Village

124
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,180
was not the doing of the Moon Sect.

125
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,030
But when I first

126
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,590
performed acupuncture on you, you said

127
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,350
the Moon Sect

128
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,790
had once planned

129
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,470
to carry out a massacre at the Mo Family Village.

130
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,950
The Moon Sect did plan

131
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,390
to attack the Mo Family Village,

132
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,720
but before we could act,

133
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,070
everyone there had already

134
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,130
been slaughtered.

135
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,510
As for who did it,

136
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,160
I don't know either.

137
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,750
How could it be?

138
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,190
You've gone to such great lengths

139
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,430
to uncover the truth.

140
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,870
To be honest,

141
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,330
I admire your determination.

142
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,960
But even so,

143
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,870
I won't let you

144
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,930
walk out that door.

145
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,200
Ziye.

146
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,800
Are you alright?

147
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Don't move!

148
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,390
You came prepared?

149
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,130
You appeared weak just to deceive me!

150
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,170
The Apothecary Valley

151
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,070
is not a place that anyone can intrude upon.

152
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,930
I didn't expect you

153
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,230
to be so cunning.

154
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,440
Since you

155
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,290
don't have the answers I want,

156
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,800
you may leave.

157
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,680
You're actually willing to let me go?

158
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,590
I just want the truth.

159
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,900
I never wanted to take your life.

160
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,230
Also,

161
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,830
what you took just now

162
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,570
was a Gut-Rupturing Pill from my valley.

163
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,390
It's enough to keep you in check.

164
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,510
I'll regularly send you

165

166
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,360
that can suppress this poison.

167
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,790
I hope you can

168
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,230
keep the secret about the Mo Family Village for me.

actually had nothing to do with the Moon Sect.

176
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,850
I'm at a loss now.

177
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,950
What should I do?

178
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,110
Chief.

179
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,080
Chief Jing says she has something important to tell you.

180
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,260
What brought you back?

181
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,690
You could've killed me today,

182
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,390
but you let me go instead.

183
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,950
I don't like being in anyone's debt.

184
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,010
I have to repay you.

185
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,160
The Moon Sect

186
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,030
didn't just establish itself in the martial world with poisons.

187
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,040
We've also collected a lot of

188
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,700
little-known intelligence.

189
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,010
I just remembered

190
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,390
that in my sect's ancient tomb,

191
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,390
there are records about the Mo Family Village.

192
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,670
There may be clues

193
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,530
about the massacre back then.

194
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,430
After I return, I'll look through the bamboo slips

195
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,360
and write to you.

196
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,670
I'm surprised

197
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,870
that you're so straightforward and generous.

198
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,150
Thank you in advance.

199
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,150
We're even now.

200
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,570
No need to thank me.

201
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,830
Wait.

202
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,190
Since you're honest with me,

203
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,370
I can't lie to you anymore.

204
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
I did have someone put something

205
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,910
in your food,

206
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,860
but it wasn't poison

207
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,870
but a tonic.

208
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,630
Tonic?

209
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,790
Then why did I feel unwell?

210
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,820
Just a side effect of excessive nourishment.

211
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,880
It was not harmful.

212
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,300
A healer doesn't kill.

213
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,800
Then what about the Gut-Rupturing Pill

214
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,760
you made me take?

215
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,310
It's also just a tonic.

216
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,480
Well, well.

217
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,060
I actually fell for your tricks twice.

218
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,170
If you really meant to harm me,

219
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,510
you could kill me

220
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,690
any time you want, couldn't you?

221
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,390
You said you're from the Mo Family Village.

222
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,050
That's not a lie, is it?

223
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,550
I wasn't born

224
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,950
in the Mo Family Village,

225
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,270
but the Mo Family Village

226
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,550
was my second home.

227
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,380
Sounds like there's quite a story there.

228
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
11 years ago,

229
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,370
my family suffered a misfortune.

230
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,750
My mother and I ended up in Jiulin

231
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,640
and passed through the Mo Family Village.

232
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,920
Don't be afraid.

233
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,830
Behave yourselves,

234
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,600
or I'll kill you right now!

235
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,030
Take this.

236
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,270
Any other valuables?

237
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,070
Hand them all over!

238
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,310
She doesn't have anything!

239
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,630
She doesn't have anything.

240
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,750
You're so protective of her.

241
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,810
There's definitely something good.

242
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,240
No, no, no!

243
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,870
Get up! Let go!

244
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,070
No!

245
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,870
Let me see what treasures you have.

246
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,830
Come here.

247
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,940
Come on.

248
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,500
Hands off!

249
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,510
Mother!

250
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,030
How dare you bite me?

251
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,090
Trying to run away?

252
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,090
Behave yourself!

253
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,010
Let me go!

254
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,420
Let her go!

255
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,770
Let her go!

256
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,790
You came.

257
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,750
It's so cold today.

258
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,240
Here's the food.

259
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,030
It's still hot. Here.

260
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,750
Here.

261
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,750
Here, eat up.

262
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,990
Eat up.

263
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,240
Xuehuai, in the future...

264
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,470
After my mother died,

265
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,350
I became an orphan.

266
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,730
Sister, have some more.

267
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,030
It was the villagers of the Mo Family Village

268
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,270
who gave me a new home.

269
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,910
They not only took care of my daily needs

270
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,150
but also taught me to read and write.

271
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,780
I became the daughter of the Mo Family Village,

272
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,850
raised by all the families there.

273
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,390
Seven years passed.

274
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,540
During those seven years…

275
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,400
This is for you.

276
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,109
They treated me like their own child

277
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,839
and helped me forget the pain of losing my mother.

278
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,609
It's so beautiful.

279
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,079
Thank you, Xuehuai.

280
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,720
Look. Look at that.

281
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,020
Ming Jie…

282
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,490
Ming Jie is still in the house.

283
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,750
We can't leave him behind!

284
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,030
We can't go back!

285
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,710
Ye,

286
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,670
if we go back now,

287
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,830
none of us can survive!

288
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,190
Ming Jie!

289
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,630
Go!

290
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,190
Ming Jie!

291
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,430
Catch them!

292
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,070
Get up!

293
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,980
[Liao Qingran, the previous chief of the Apothecary Valley]

294
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,530
All the people buried here

295
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,550
were villagers

296
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,500
from back then?

297
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,230
The villagers' remains

298
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,370
were buried in the Mo Family Village.

299
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,350
These are

300
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,950
cenotaphs I built

301
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,320
to remember them by.

302
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,530
It seems that you and I are alike.

303
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,990
We've both suffered a lot,

304
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,800
unable to stay with our loved ones.

305
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,510
You also…

306
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,550
On the day I came to power

307
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,830
and became the chief

308
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,760
of the Moon Sect,

309
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,990
the sect elders, to prevent me from being distracted,

310
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,210
killed him.

311
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,150
Him?

312
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,560
Since I can remember,

313
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,820
I've been the saintess of the Moon Sect.

314
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,680
I had no family,

315
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,700
no friends,

316
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,940
not even a name of my own.

317
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,060
Until I met him.

318
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,000
By the Holy Lake,

319
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,760
he picked a red lotus

320
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,030
and softly called me

321
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,110
"Jing."

322
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,930
From then on,

323
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,330
I had my own name

324
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,180
and learned what love was.

325
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,250
We promised each other

326
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,250
to leave Lingjiu Mountain together

327
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,890
and go somewhere far away

328
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,090
to spend the rest of our lives together.

329
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,110
Unfortunately…

330
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,790
When was that?

331
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,020
The fourth year of Huijia.

332
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,740
No wonder when I gave you acupuncture

333
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,390
and mentioned the fourth year of Huijia,

334
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,720
you became so agitated.

335
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,690
The massacre at the Mo Family Village

336
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,700
also happened in the fourth year of Huijia.

337
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,300
You and I

338
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,110
suffered misfortune in the same year

339
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,440
and lost our loved ones.

340
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,710
It takes one to know one.

341
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,230
Chief Xue.

342
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,390
I like your personality

343
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,920
from the bottom of my heart.

344
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,210
Why don't we

345
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,590
become sworn sisters?

346
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,450
What do you say?

347
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,430
If you're willing,

348
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,670
you can call me Jing from now on.

349
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,830
Okay.

350
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,110
Jing.

351
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,710
Then it's a deal,

352
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,750
Ziye.

353
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,030
Actually,

354
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,750
what I did to you

355
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,840
wasn't honorable.

356
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,590
That massacre

357
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,940
is very important to me.

358
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,590
Due to my cold disease,

359
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,590
I can't be out of the valley for too long.

360
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,190
I had no choice but to do that.

361
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,320
I hope you don't blame me, Jing.

362
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,790
I don't blame you.

363
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,470
I even admire you a bit.

364
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,230
You got me this time,

365
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,670
but I'll keep score.

366
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,940
In the future,

367
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,580
I'll definitely beat you.

368
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,310
If you want to beat me,

369
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,910
you'll have to put in a lot of effort.

370
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,160
Jing, why don't you

371
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,550
stay in the valley for a few days for recuperation?

372
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,080
You didn't feel well before

373
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,020
because the tonic I made you take

374
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,880
was too strong.

375
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,630
Although it wasn't harmful,

376
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,430
a regimen can always do you good.

377
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,530
I'm about to go to the back mountain

378
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,010
to gather some nice herbs

379
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,710
to clear the toxic heat from your body

380
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,350
and regulate your disordered meridians.

381
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,870
It's my way of making amends.

382
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,710
Okay.

383
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,080
I also want

384
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,150
to learn from you

385
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,150
how to use poison.

386
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,680
Let's go.

387
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,890
Someone's coming.

388
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,550
That's…

389
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,350
Chief Xue!

390
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,030
That's Mr. Huo

391
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,070
who went to gather medicines for Mo.

392
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,520
He made it back alive.

393
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,670
Chief Xue.

394
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,840
Long time no see.

395
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,230
Miss Feng Lyu.

396
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,520
Has it been long?

397
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,150
It doesn't feel long to me.

398
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,670
Chief Xue is as humorous as ever.

399
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,710
You, however, have become

400
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,240
more annoying than before.

401
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,070
Don't talk as if

402
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,150
we're very close.

403
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,890
I saved your life once,

404
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,400
and you saved mine once.

405
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,350
If that hadn't made us close,

406
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,030
there were no close friends

407
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,110
in this world.

408
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,470
Don't cozy up to me!

409
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,790
You're nothing more than

410
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,760
a relative of my patient.

411
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,840
Not special at all.

412
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,670
Without the Fate-Reversal Token and 100,000 coins for treatment,

413
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,230
even if

414
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,420
the chief of the Sword Sect came,

415
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,950
I still wouldn't treat you.

416
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,430
I'm just slightly injured.

417
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,950
I'll recover in several days.

418
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,420
I just brought back

419
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,750
the Seven-Leaf Fungus.

420
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,880
After having a few drinks, I'll leave.

421
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,520
Where's the Seven-Leaf Fungus?

422
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,390
I've already had Snow Harrier

423
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,850
send it back to the valley.

424
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,940
What's wrong?

425
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,370
The chief of the Moon Sect is in the valley.

426
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,850
Chief Jing.

427
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,050
You're up so early.

428
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,400
Is your chief up?

429
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,370
I'm leaving.

430
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,680
Chief Jing, you haven't fully recovered yet.

431
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,240
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

432
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,950
I've been away from the sect for some time.

433
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,670
Besides,

434
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,430
I need to hurry back

435
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,230
to look into something for Ziye.

436
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,230
Oh, right.

437
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,880
I've left a female disciple behind.

438
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,950
After Ziye writes down the prescription,

439
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,010
just give it to her.

440
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,070
Chief has gone out

441
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,510
to collect herbs with Feng Lyu.

442
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,550
It'll probably take more than two hours

443
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,750
for them to come back.

444
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,350
Then I won't wait for her.

445
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,550
Pass my message to her.

446
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,410
I'll get going.

447
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,070
Okay.

448
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,450
Let me walk you out.

449
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,720
The Seven-Leaf Fungus?

450
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,370
It's the treasure of the Moon Sect.

451
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,650
Why is it here in the Apothecary Valley?

452
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,120
Tell me.

453
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,260
What's going on?

454
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,740
Where's that stupid bird from?

455
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,400
Chief Jing!

456
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,270
Chief.

457
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,110
That stupid bird is yours?

458
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,630
It's fine now, Snow Harrier.

459
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,150
I shot your dart down just to save my bird.

460
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,430
Please forgive me, Chief.

461
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,560
The Dark Soul Sword?

462
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,610
You're Seven from the Sword Sect?

463
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,910
You're so observant.

464
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,470
Did you steal

465
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,110
the Seven-Leaf Fungus from my sect?

466
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,910
Yes, I did.

467
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,300
Please calm down, Jing.

468
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,220
Are you defending him, Ziye?

469
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,480
I'm not defending him.

470
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,500
It's just that the Seven-Leaf Fungus

471
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,630
is the active ingredient

472
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,880
in one of my prescriptions.

473
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,150
I'm the one who asked him

474
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,430
to get it for me.

475
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,280
So you're in cahoots all along.

476
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,230
You lured me into the valley,

477
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,090
became sworn sisters with me,

478
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,750
told me about your life story,

479
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,610
and kept me here

480
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,590
just for the Seven-Leaf Fungus?

481
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,630
Is this all a deliberate deception?

482
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,590
I do see you as my sister,

483
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,110
and I meant every word I said.

484
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,710
There's no deception at all.

485
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,090
I swear to God.

486
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,680
Since you said it like that,

487
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,230
I'll believe you.

488
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,990
You made Huo Zhanbai

489
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,590
steal the Seven-Leaf Fungus

490
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,530
before we became friends.

491
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,310
But as the chief of the Moon Sect,

492
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,630
I must give my disciples

493
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,560
an explanation.

494
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,030
What kind of explanation do you want, Jing?

495
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,680
These two cups of poisoned wine before me

496
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,470
have different levels of toxicity.

497
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,590
One is strong, the other is mild.

498
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,510
One of them

499
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,950
has my sect's Red Scorpion Poison in it.

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,870
It's made from the venom of seven-year-old

501
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,070
toads and scorpions.

502
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,350
Within 30 minutes after taking it,

503
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,230
the taker will have a high fever and delirium.

504
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,390
Their meridians will expand

505
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,850
and burst, causing death.

506
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,510
As for the other poison,

507
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,510
it's only an ordinary insect poison

508
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,310
that will cause pain throughout the body,

509
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,370
but it isn't fatal.

510
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,710
I want you two

511
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,230
to each choose a cup of wine and drink it.

512
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,270
As long as you drink,

513
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,430
I'll wipe the slate clean

514
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,830
and never hold you accountable again.

515
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,360
However, one of you

516
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,250
will definitely

517
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,310
drink the wine with the fatal poison.

518
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,110
By then,

519
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,030
you can only blame your bad luck.

520
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,240
Don't blame me for being cruel.

521
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,450
Chief Jing, your word is your bond.

522
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,010
Will you keep that promise?

523
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,510
Of course.

524
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,520
You're not afraid of death at all, are you?

525
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,720
No matter what poison I take today,

526
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,210
I believe that you, Chief Xue,

527
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,090
can cure me.

528
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,190
Shut up!

529
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,950
Do you think it's that easy to find a cure

530
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,480
for the Moon Sect's poison?

531
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,390
Pick.

532
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,180
Huo Zhanbai, what are you doing?

533
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,950
As luck would have it,

534
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm dying for a drink today.

535
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,030
Let me finish

536
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,850
these two cups of wine.

537
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,010
Huo Zhanbai,

538
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,090
don't play hero!

539
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,910
Who are you to take the fall for me?

540
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,910
Who are you to make decisions for me?

541
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,750
Chief Xue.

542
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,000
The Seven-Leaf Fungus

543
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,310
is the medicine I need.

544
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,430
And it was I who sneaked into

545
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,830
the Moon Sect to steal it.

546
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,380
From beginning to end,

547
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,710
this matter has nothing to do with you.

548
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,170
So I should drink both cups

549
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,710
of the poisoned wine.

550
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,310
But, later,

551
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,710
I have to count on you for detoxification.

552
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,750
My life

553
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,120
is in your hands today.

554
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,210
You have so much faith in me.

555
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,710
What if I can't detox you?

556
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,730
Chief Jing.

557
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,670
I wonder if I can keep

558
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,200
the Seven-Leaf Fungus now.

559
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,410
You have some guts.

560
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,630
From now on,

561
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,670
no one in the Moon Sect

562
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,790
will hold this

563
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,050
against you two again.

564
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,390
Yes, Chief.

565
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,830
Thank you, Chief.

566
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,960
If you die from the poisons,

567
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,130
it's because you acted rashly

568
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,470
and drank those two cups of poisoned wine.

569
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,870
You're in over your head.

570
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,760
If I died

571
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,070
because of fine wine,

572
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,390
wouldn't that be a death without regrets?

573
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,640
Huo Zhanbai!

574
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,240
Mr. Huo.

575
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm fine.

576
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,210
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

577
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,430
The poisons weren't fatal.

578
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,910
I just said that to scare you guys.

579
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,710
Even if he took both of the poisons,

580
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,310
it wouldn't make him suffer like this.

581
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,780
There's a poison that has been in his body for a long time,

582
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,980
but he's managed to suppress it by sealing his acupoints.

583
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,750
Is it…

584
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,430
Is it arsenopyrite from the ancient tomb?

585
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,470
Arsenopyrite is made from

586
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,230
the venom of ten-year-old toads.

587
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,070
It's fatal.

588
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,550
The victims will suffer paralysis

589
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,950
or even immediate death.

590
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,330
It's indeed arsenopyrite.

591
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,070
Hurry.

592
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,030
Bring him to the medicine hut now!

593
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,030
The poison has entered his organs.

594
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,930
Within 30 minutes,

595
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:09,880
his meridians will expand

596
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,290
and burst, leading to death.

597
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:11,820
Feng Lyu.

598
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,270
Prick the acupoints of Chengjiang,

599
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,730
Huagai,

600
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,750
and Tanzhong

601
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
to release blood.

602
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,030
Hold him down!

603
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,030
Chief.

604
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,090
The poison marks on his body

605
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,490
seem to be getting worse.

606
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,150
It's too late.

607
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,320
Shuang Hong.

608
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,270
But Chief…

609
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:11,850
Do it.

610
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:12,990
Yes.

611
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,350
Help him up.

612
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,340
Yes.

613
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,470
You're lucky to be alive.

614
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,510
Ziye.

615
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,660
Is he out of danger now?

616
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,830
Your medical skills are truly miraculous.

617
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,790
Arsenopyrite

618
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,470
is a poison from the Moon Sect,

619
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,530
but when mixed with the other two poisons,

620
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,390
even I couldn't do anything about it.

621
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,920
Yet you managed to save him.

622
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,070
I need to tell you

623
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,710
how I saved him.

624
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,230
Those poisons

625
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,960
created toxic heat in his body.

626
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,440
In order to detoxify it,

627
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,830
I had no choice but to use...

628
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,830
Ziye, say no more.

629
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,710
It was reckless of me

630
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,110
to force him to drink the poisoned wine.

631
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,030
Or you wouldn't have exhausted yourself

632
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,150
saving him.

633
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,250
Now that he's fine,

634
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,930
nothing else matters.

635
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,280
Are you not angry, Jing?

636
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,450
Seven is quite a man.

637
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,690
I respect him.

638
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,510
He drank both cups of poisoned wine

639
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,540
without blinking.

640
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,230
After seeing how chivalrous he was,

641
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,230
even if I wanted to be angry,

642
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,890
I couldn't bring myself to be.

643
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,630
But…

644
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,310
I've thought it through.

645
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,120
If he dared to pay with his life,

646
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,990
I'd let him keep that Fungus.

647
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,990
After I fully recover

648
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,950
and go back,

649
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,790
I can plant another one

650
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,230
in the Holy Lake.

651
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,360
It just means

652
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,820
waiting for a few decades.

653
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,950
Ziye, there's something you don't know.

654
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,590
We see

655
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,350
the Seven-Leaf Fungus as a sacred thing,

656
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,150
partly because

657
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,430
it grows in the Holy Lake

658
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,990
and has rare medicinal properties.

659
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,990
It's also because

660
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,170
the poisonous miasma surrounding it

661
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,570
is extremely dangerous.

662
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,790
No one has been able to get through it since our sect was founded.

663
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,990
That has always been

664
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,270
the Moon Sect's pride.

665
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,580
I just didn't expect that

666
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,990
Seven

667
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,590
not only had exceptional martial arts skills

668
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,990
but also had little regard for his own life.

669
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,240
Mr. Huo drank two cups of poisoned wine

670
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,440
and finally

671
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,670
managed to keep the Seven-Leaf Fungus.

672
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,870
Granny, do you know

673
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,110
that the prescription

674
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,640
I gave to Huo Zhanbai before

675
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,470
may be completely ineffective?

676
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,270
It was just a stopgap,

677
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,150
but he's actually

678
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,680
risking his life to collect those medicines.

679
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,840
Only after I got the Seven-Leaf Fungus

680
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,470
did I know

681
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,480
that it couldn't help

682
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,570
with Mo's illness.

683
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,540
It'll even worsen his condition.

684
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,830
Should I honestly tell Mr. Huo

685
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,030
that the prescription won't work?

686
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,270
I told you

687
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,690
that prescription

688
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,550
didn't just save one person.

689
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,150
When Mr. Huo

690
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,430
was on the brink of death,

691
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,110
it was that prescription

692
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,390
that saved his life.

693
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,520
The fake prescription you gave him

694
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,350
saved his life.

695
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,410
So, Granny, you mean…

696
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,410
That prescription

697
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,190
is Mr. Huo's hope.

698
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,550
[Herbal Prescriptions]

699
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,390
Mr. Huo has traveled far and wide

700
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,150
and even risked his life

701
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,320
to find a cure for Mo.

702
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,990
In other people' eyes,

703
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,070
such persistence and waiting

704
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,550
may be a kind of torture.

705
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,360
But for him,

706
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,430
it's the hope that Mo may survive.

707
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,750
Holding onto this hope

708
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,280
and going all out for it…

709
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,150
Maybe

710
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,030
this is his belief.

711
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,480
What are you looking at?

712
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,990
I'm examining him closely

713
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,530
from his eyebrows to his chin.

714
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,080
Mr. Seven is so handsome.

715
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,510
I can't see any flaws.

716
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,510
No wonder Chief

717
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,630
treats him differently.

718
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,830
Chief is not like you.

719
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,620
That's not the reason.

720
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,720
Then what's the reason?

721
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,610
You placed this piece here

722
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,030
not to take

723
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,710
but as a feint.

724
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,030
The goal is to make me move my pieces out of

725
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,630
the formation you've set up,

726
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,050
allowing your pieces to connect.

727
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,230
Emissary Miao Feng.

728
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,380
Did you mean to kill me?

729
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,430
I didn't know it was you, Emissary Miao Shui.

730
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,110
Really?

731
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,150
Why do I feel

732
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,590
that you were so brutal

733
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,270
exactly because you knew it was me?

734
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,010
Emissary Miao Shui, you must be kidding.

735
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,630
No matter how much I hate you,

736
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,430
as long as you're still useful to the Doctrine Leader,

737
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,030
I'll let you live.

738
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,150
Emissary Miao Feng,

739
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,110
what you said

740
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,110
has broken my heart.

741
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,480
I thought you were meeting

742
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,530
your lover in the remote mountain,

743
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,110
but it turns out you're just playing chess.

744
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,190
How boring.

745
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,250
Don't touch it.

746
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,110
How rare.

747
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,160
Emissary Miao Feng,

748
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,880
you actually have something you care about now.

749
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
You should leave.

750
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,270
Alright.

751
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,630
I'll leave.

752
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,370
I'm here just to tell you

753
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,510
that you've been away from the palace for a long time.

754
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,630
If you don't return

755
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,950
to the Doctrine Leader soon,

756
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,410
the Ice Silkworm Poison in you will flare up.

757
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,790
When that happens,

758
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,550
the Doctrine Leader will be worried.

759
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,540
Instead of falling for my trap,

760
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,470
you actually took advantage of it.

761
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,710
Brilliant.

762
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,670
Then I'll just play along

763
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,350
and see how you will react.
