4
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,110
Come in.

5
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,790
Ziye.

6
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,210
Granny.

7
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,750
Chief,

8
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,480
Mr. Seven has already left.

9
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,870
He won't leave easily

10
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,070
before he figures out

11
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,150
the matter of the Seven-Leaf Fungus.

12
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,240
Did you speak out of turn again?

13
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,750
Have you brought in the Caulis Spatholobi

14
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,520
drying outside the medicine hut?

15
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,320
W-We are going to bring it in now.

16
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,760
Granny, you're defending them.

17
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,420
It makes me look like a bad guy.

18
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,110
They know

19
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,250
you won't blame them

20
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,700
for this kind of thing.

21
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,990
Are you

22
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,770
still angry at Mr. Huo?

23
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,660
Angry about what?

24
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,020
He didn't understand the situation

25
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,170
and talked nonsense.

26
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,630
I won't stoop to his level.

27
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,650
It's good that you think this way.

28
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,910
Worry and anger are bad for your health.

29
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,190
Avoid them if you can.

30
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,900
Mr. Seven knows

31
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,030
it was a critical situation back then.

32
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,490
You had no choice but to use

33
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,670
the Seven-Leaf Fungus to save him.

34
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,870
So,

35
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,190
he wanted to apologize to you in person.

36
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,670
But I was worried you'd get angry after seeing him,

37
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,990
so I asked him to leave.

38
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,650
There's no need for him to apologize.

39
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,590
You're worried

40
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,380
Mr. Seven would connect it

41
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,150
to that prescription after knowing

42
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,610
the Seven-Leaf Fungus has been used, right?

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,740
Sometimes,

44
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,270
not telling the truth

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,380
is for that person's good.

46
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,030
It's all in the past.

47
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,870
Now I'm just worried

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,840
whether I can find

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,170
my silver bell hairpin.

50
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,670
Then go out to look for it.

51
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,630
Chief Xue,

52
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,950
why are you here?

53
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,830
I...

54
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,020
came here to look for something.

55
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,470
Chief Xue, you're also looking for

56
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,530
something, right?

57
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,110
Why don't I look for it with you?

58
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,110
Are you that free?

59
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
I just think

60
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,430
maybe we can find it sooner

61
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,890
if we look for it together.

62
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,430
If you can just keep your mouth shut,

63
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,090
perhaps we can find it sooner.

64
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,110
Then you can only

65
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,330
hit my mute acupoint.

66
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,950
Mr. Huo,

67
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,370
looks like you are also shameless

68
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,070
apart from loving to break your promises.

69
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,870
Exactly.

70
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:50,770
Only a shameless person

71
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,810
like me

72
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,990
can withstand

73
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,350
your ruthlessness.

74
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,600
My ruthlessness

75
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,250
is no match for your glib tongue.

76
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,700
Yes.

77
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,650
Whatever you say is right.

78
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,750
Chief Xue.

79
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,040
Did I just

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
make you angry again?

81
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,490
When I said you were ruthless just now,

82
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,570
it was just to lighten the mood.

83
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,650
I didn't mean it.

84
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:20,910
Chief Xue.

85
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,150
Chief Xue!

86
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,510
Chief Xue, why have you stopped talking?

87
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,800
A snowstorm is coming!

88
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,750
The weather in the mountain changes rapidly.

89
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,510
In the time it took you to say those words,

90
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,390
the snowstorm has already gotten stronger.

91
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,670
If we don't leave now,

92
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,270
we might be trapped here.

93
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,110
Oh no.

94
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm afraid we can't get out now.

95
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,990
There's a cave ahead.

96
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,909
Let's take shelter there for now.

97
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,310
Okay.

98
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,170
Be careful.

99
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,970
What are you doing?

100
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,960
I thought

101
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,380
you were going to slap me again

102
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,310
like you did in the hot spring pool.

103
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,750
You were shielding me from the snowstorm just now.

104
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,310
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

105
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,909
Of course I understand that.

106
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,530
So Chief Xue,

107
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,790
you can be reasonable.

108
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,570
Take off your coat.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,110
Why?

110
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,760
Take off your coat and give it to me.

111
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,600
You're really not being polite at all.

112
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,750
You ate the Seven-Leaf Fungus.

113
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,280
You won't die anytime soon.

114
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,590
Granny Ning told you, right?

115
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,549
It's very likely

116
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,230
that you came here

117
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,590
to look for the hairpin for me.

118
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,850
You even knew that too?

119
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,110
When I treated you in the Apothecary Valley,

120
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,260
all the items on you

121
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,250
were removed.

122
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,620
Mr. Huo, you don't have

123
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,830
anything valuable

124
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,580
on you.

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,420
What could possibly be worth your trip here?

126
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,130
Chief Xue, you're really

127
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,100
observant.

128
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,530
It would be better if you had left the valley directly.

129
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,310
If I had left the valley directly,

130
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,130
I wouldn't have been trapped here

131
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,170
with you now.

132
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,270
Thinking about it this way,

133
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,130
I actually feel quite fortunate.

134
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,520
With me here,

135
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,410
I might be able to help you.

136
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,550
I think

137
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,190
nothing good ever comes from meeting you.

138
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,200
Now

139
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,240
we're trapped in the snowstorm.

140
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,620
Being trapped here in the snowstorm

141
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,700
is also my fault?

142
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,150
He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick.

143
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,550
You are

144
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,030
so talkative.

145
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,290
If I'm not so talkative,

146
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,620
how could I explain things clearly to you?

147
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,070
Yes.

148
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,000
Regarding the Seven-Leaf Fungus,

149
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,190
I was indeed impulsive.

150
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,110
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,870
I misunderstood you.

152
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,050
About the Seven-Leaf Fungus,

153
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,520
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

154
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,460
That doesn't sound like

155
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,660
the Chief Xue I know.

156
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,430
If it were like usual,

157
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,750
you would have said

158
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,750
some harsh words.

159
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,170
You'd better not open your mouth.

160
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,950
I'm not going to shut my mouth today.

161
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,380
I must

162
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,350
explain to you properly

163
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,470
how the misunderstanding came about.

164
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,070
The chief of Moon Sect told me

165
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,410
you wanted to use the Seven-Leaf Fungus

166
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,470
to save your lover.

167
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,550
I mistakenly thought it was

168
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,430
someone else.

169
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,750
Now that I think about it,

170
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,410
she must have misunderstood.

171
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,790
I see.

172
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,720
On this land of ice and snow,

173
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,170
where did you find the firewood?

174
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,630
Has the snowstorm outside

175
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,790
weakened a bit?

176
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,870
It's dark outside now

177
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,950
and the snowstorm is strong.

178
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,550
Just rest assured and relax.

179
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,380
Are you worried Granny Ning and the others

180
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,190
might risk coming out to look for you?

181
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,070
They know

182
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,390
I came out to look for the hairpin for you.

183
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,750
It might occur to them

184
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,590
that we would run into each other

185
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,120
and take care of each other.

186
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,200
Don't worry.

187
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,940
Granny Ning will take care of the valley.

188
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,670
Have you found Ziye?

189
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,560
We've searched everywhere we could go.

190
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,030
But the snowstorm outside is too strong.

191
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,650
Some places are simply inaccessible.

192
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,280
Why don't we go further

193
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,370
into the mountain?

194
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,790
The snowstorm is too strong now.

195
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,870
If we rashly go further,

196
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,270
we'll only lose our way

197
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,840
and we might be trapped

198
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,430
in the mountain due to the snowstorm.

199
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,950
Ziye has lived in the valley for a long time.

200
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,510
She's familiar with the terrain here

201
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,310
and the weather in the mountain.

202
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,690
She wouldn't just wait for the snowstorm

203
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,690
to come.

204
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,830
Even though she can't come down from the mountain for now,

205
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,830
she should be able

206
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,720
to find a temporary shelter soon.

207
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,670
But even if she can take shelter from the snowstorm,

208
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,270
she can't keep herself warm.

209
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,710
What if Chief's cold disease

210
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,570
takes its toll?

211
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,390
I...

212
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,260
I'm going to look for her again.

213
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,370
I'll go with you.

214
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,770
If you act recklessly

215
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,590
and get trapped in the mountain,

216
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,580
when Ziye comes back,

217
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,370
how should I explain it to her?

218
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,190
Mr. Seven

219
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,640
went to look for the hairpin with Ziye.

220
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,820
He will protect Ziye.

221
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,830
Doctors

222
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,900
can't stand people like you the most.

223
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,080
What kind of people?

224
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,350
Those who take their good health for granted

225
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,480
and act recklessly.

226
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,270
If I had known you'd be like this,

227
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,170
I shouldn't have bothered to save you.

228
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,380
Didn't you say

229
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,730
that I won't die anytime soon?

230
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,570
But you're not like me.

231
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,990
Although there's a bonfire in front of us,

232
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,910
the cold air from outside the cave

233
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,900
keeps coming in.

234
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,390
Did you bring any

235
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,720
energy-boosting pill?

236
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,430
Fortunately, before I left the valley,

237
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,630
I filled the wine pot.

238
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,560
When you feel cold,

239
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,760
take a couple of sips.

240
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,520
Wine can ward off the cold.

241
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,840
How are you feeling?

242
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,560
Are you feeling better?

243
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,120
Not much better.

244
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,810
It doesn't warm the stomach like Laughing at the World.

245
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,980
Speaking of Laughing at the World,

246
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
I remember

247
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,950
you said Laughing at the World is hot-natured.

248
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,020
I just recovered from the fire poison,

249
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,950
so it's not suitable for me to drink it.

250
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,910
But why can I eat

251
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,970
something hot-natured

252
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,570
like the Seven-Leaf Fungus?

253
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,920
Did you deliberately say that

254
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,630
to fool me because you didn't want me

255
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,360
to drink Laughing at the World?

256
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,270
You're right.

257
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,470
I've never seen anyone

258
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,310
so openly stingy before.

259
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,150
I'm not a stingy person.

260
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,320
The wine is all yours.

261
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,540
Drink slowly.

262
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,220
I won't snatch it from you.

263
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,930
Are you sure about this?

264
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,130
Even if you freeze to death,

265
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,590
I won't be grateful to you.

266
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,859
I insist on making you remember my kindness.

267
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,550
If you need my help

268
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,400
in the future...

269
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,270
What?

270
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,500
You want to give yourself to me in return?

271
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,430
Do you really...

272
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,080
I won't waive even a bit of the medical fee.

273
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,550
You are

274
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,200
such a boring woman.

275
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,530
You're interesting.

276
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,800
Yet your beloved one

277
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,590
married someone else.

278
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,870
Don't talk nonsense.

279
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,360
I only see her as my junior.

280
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,080
Did I say I was talking about Qiushui Yin?

281
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,610
Aren't you going to ask

282
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,550
how I found out about

283
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,350
what's between you and your junior?

284
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm not going to ask you.

285
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,630
You are

286
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,830
such a boring man.

287
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,720
I don't want you to blackmail me.

288
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,880
I'm not cold.

289
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,230
Stop acting tough.

290
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,820
If you die here,

291
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,470
I won't be able to go back either.

292
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,500
Chief Xue,

293
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,580
since we've shared a pot of wine,

294
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,990
from now on, we'll be friends.

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,790
In the future, don't call me

296
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,850
Mr. Seven anymore.

297
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,380
Just call me Seven.

298
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,690
Don't fall asleep.

299
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,560
Your internal energy will be in disorder.

300
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,880
I don't need you to tell me that.

301
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,470
You still haven't told me

302
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,230
how you found out

303
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,470
about what's between me and my junior.

304
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,070
Guess.

305
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,310
The snowy night is long.

306
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,780
Why don't I tell you about it?

307
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,470
Just to kill time.

308
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,510
You offered to tell me about it.

309
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,050
It's not because I want to hear it.

310
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,830
I

311
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,010
have been an orphan since childhood.

312
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,790
My master adopted me.

313
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,050
Celestial Alp Sect is my home.

314
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,350
My junior and I have spent time together

315
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,550
since we were little.

316
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,270
But I never thought that one day,

317
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,790
she would leave me

318
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,800
and marry Sixth Brother, Xu Chonghua.

319
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,400
Later, Sword Sect

320
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,950
came to the Central Plains to select candidates from various sects

321
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,410
to be the eight swordsmen.

322
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,860
I was chosen by Chief Nangong,

323
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,030
so I left Celestial Alp Sect.

324
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,190
Who would have thought

325
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,430
my junior and I would meet again

326
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,310
in Sword Sect?

327
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,250
So many years have passed.

328
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,380
Those indescribable feelings

329
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,070
in youth

330
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,190
are long gone.

331
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,710
Sixth Brother is gone.

332
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,650
My junior and Mo are alone.

333
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,830
The two of them

334
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,230
and Master

335
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,350
are now

336
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,550
my most important family in this world.

337
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,500
Chief Xue.

338
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,750
Chief Xue.

339
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,770
Are you listening?

340
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,230
Chief Xue.

341
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,150
Now that I think about it,

342
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,670
everything was destined.

343
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,350
It's fate.

344
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,870
There's no need to cling to obsessions.

345
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,210
It's fate.

346
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,330
There's no need to cling to obsessions.

347
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,510
But sometimes,

348
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,160
obsessions are like crutches.

349
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,200
Without the support of the stick,

350
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,750
one can't survive the snowstorm.

351
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,910
That's why you kept

352
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,510
trying to find that hairpin?

353
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,320
Is the hairpin a gift

354
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,000
from that young man in the cold spring?

355
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,190
His name is Xuehuai.

356
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,510
If it weren't for him,

357
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,720
I would have died long ago

358
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,550
or been eaten by fishes.

359
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,870
Here.

360
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,490
Take a few sips.

361
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,480
That day

362
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,830
was as cold as it is now.

363
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,010
Every time my cold disease takes its toll,

364
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,470
I would wonder

365
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,640
if his pain and cold

366
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,320
were 100 times worse than mine

367
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,700
when he was soaking alone

368
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,460
in the icy river.

369
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,740
Xuehuai saved me twice.

370
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,410
The first time,

371
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,830
he gave me a home.

372
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,510
Then

373
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,150
♫A cup of wine, a toast to the world, as wind and snow knock on the door♫

374
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,610
he saved me at the cost of his own life.

375
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:59,250
♫Sigh for love and hate, leaving no trace upon the palm♫

376
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,270
I've been practicing medicine diligently

377
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:06,000
♫Life drifts like dust, when will we meet again?♫

378
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,050
in hopes of bringing him back to life.

379
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:12,640
♫From vibrant warmth to icy cold, it's just a single turn away♫

380
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,990
Your medical skills are excellent.

381
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,360
You'll surely be able to bring him back to life.

382
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,860
♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

383
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:25,690
♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

384
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,820
Everyone says my medical skills are excellent,

385
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,880
but sometimes, I...

386
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,830
♫With pure and earnest hearts, how many lovers remain?♫

387
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,200
You what?

388
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:40,460
♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

389
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,190
Sometimes I'm afraid.

390
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,410
Afraid of what?

391
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:46,760
♫Across vast mountains and seas, I offer myself to you♫

392
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,620
I'm afraid that the snowstorm would be too big

393
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,790
and I can't make it till that day.

394
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:53,970
♫Guarding every lonely night, holding a light for you♫

395
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:01,030
♫I give my remaining years, how could I ever break free?♫

396
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:08,270
♫Love falls like silent snow, sweeping away lost souls♫

397
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,830
I'm here.

398
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,650
I won't let anything happen to you.

399
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,230
♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

400
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,760
♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:11,870
♫As long as you can recognize us every time♫

412
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,030
Chief Xue.

413
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,080
Chief Xue.

414
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,660
Chief Xue!

415
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,100
I'll take you back to Apothecary Valley.

416
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,940
Sorry.

417
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,590
Xue Ziye,

418
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,090
Apothecary Valley is just ahead.

419
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,750
Hang in there a little longer.

420
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,140
Xue Ziye.

421
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,060
Xue Ziye.

422
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,410
Talk to me, okay?

423
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,650
We're almost there.

424
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,610
Hang in there a little longer.

425
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,490
Xue Ziye.

426
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,190
How are you?

427
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,910
Xuehuai.

428
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,360
Xuehuai.

429
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,540
What did you say?

430
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,590
Xue...

431
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,750
Xuehuai.

432
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,790
What did you say?

433
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,340
Xuehuai.

434
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,510
Xuehuai.

435
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,030
Yes.

436
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,720
Xuehuai.

437
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,110
If you die,

438
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,700
who will fetch Rootless Water

439
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,230
to water the dead branches?

440
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,740
Xue Ziye,

441
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,110
wake up.

442
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,230
Xuehuai is still waiting for you.

443
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,310
Xue Ziye.

444
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Your hairpin hasn't been found yet.

445
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:51,890
Xue Ziye.

446
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,110
Snow Harrier,

447
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,990
go ask for help!

448
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,590
Xue Ziye,

449
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,140
open your eyes and look.

450
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,210
Look, what is this?

451
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,650
I've found your hairpin.

452
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,790
This place is covered with snow,

453
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,580
but I actually have found your hairpin.

454
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,470
This is fate.

455
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,560
I promise you

456
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,510
after you wake up,

457
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,790
I will personally give it to you.

458
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,350
Okay?

459
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,310
Damn woman!

460
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,090
Xue Ziye!

461
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:06,930
Ziye.

462
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,370
Ziye.

463
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,650
I won't let you die here.

464
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,670
-Chief!
-Chief!

465
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,640
Mr. Seven!

466
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,160
-Chief!
-Chief!

467
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,790
Chief!

468
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,290
-Mr. Seven!
-Chief!

469
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,460
Chief!

470
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,640
Keep a close watch.

471
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,890
Don't leave her side for a moment.

472
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,790
Granny,

473
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,790
is Chief Xue alright?

474
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,760
She's out of danger now.

475
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,710
But

476
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,070
she still needs to rest for a few days.

477
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,860
It's good that she's alright.

478
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,170
The snowstorm was too strong last night.

479
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
We couldn't go into the mountain to look for her.

480
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
We were very worried.

481
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,950
Thanks to your help,

482
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,790
Ziye survived.

483
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,110
Everyone in the valley

484
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,600
is very grateful to you.

485
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Granny, no need for such formality.

486
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,470
Chief Xue saved my life.

487
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,600
It's my duty

488
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,490
to protect her.

489
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,150
I was right about you.

490
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,010
You are indeed a righteous and kind person.

491
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,140
Ziye has been a loner,

492
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,220
accustomed to solitude.

493
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,010
She's very lucky

494
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,830
to have a friend like you.

495
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,370
Granny, I'm flattered.

496
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,830
But I'm not sure

497
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,990
if Chief Xue

498
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,940
considers me...

499
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,910
I know Ziye's temperament.

500
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,940
She's also a person who values friendship.

501
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,490
Don't worry, Mr. Seven.

502
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,800
Go back and have a good rest.

503
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,000
I'll take care of her.

504
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,250
Thank you, Granny.

505
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,380
Granny,

506
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,480
where is Mr. Huo?

507
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,130
I forgot this medicine.

508
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,800
Deliver it to Mr. Huo now

509
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,070
so that he can warm himself up

510
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,790
and ward off the cold.

511
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,320
Okay.

512
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,640
Looks like the top swordsman in the Central Plains

513
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,300
is also skilled in carpentry.

514
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,990
Mr. Huo.

515
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,350
Chief Xue, how are you feeling?

516
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,470
I won't die anytime soon.

517
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,980
You're leaving?

518
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,440
Through investigation, I found out

519
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,550
the Azure Phoenix Flower of the White Cloud Palace

520
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,210
will appear in Yangzhou soon.

521
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,140
To avoid unforeseen circumstances,

522
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,150
I must leave immediately

523
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,950
for Yangzhou to find the medicine.

524
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,010
Mr. Huo, you're indeed

525
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,610
exceptionally courageous.

526
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,870
The poison hasn't been fully eliminated.

527
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,040
And you spent a night in a snowstorm.

528
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,030
Yet you're confident enough to take the risk to look for the medicine?

529
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,750
Chief Xue,

530
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,710
do you disapprove of someone like me

531
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,440
who doesn't cherish his health

532
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,250
and acts recklessly again?

533
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,010
If you come back half-dead again,

534
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:00,940
I won't save you.

535
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,390
Chief Xue, you're not the kind of person

536
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,310
who would stand by and watch someone die.

537
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,240
I thought you didn't want to see me.

538
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,980
You only came to say goodbye

539
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,150
before leaving.

540
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,470
Were you avoiding me?

541
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,430
Chief Xue,

542
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,030
you didn't come to me either.

543
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,180
I guess you saw through

544
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,040
my little ruse long ago.

545
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,750
You're right.

546
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,840
I indeed didn't find the hairpin that day.

547
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,340
It was just a wooden twig.

548
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,490
I realized it when I woke up.

549
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,520
How could there be such a coincidence?

550
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,100
The snowstorm was so strong.

551
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,190
How could the silver bell hairpin

552
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,270
just happen to

553
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,250
fall on the snow

554
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,640
and be found by you?

555
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,950
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

556
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,230
Calling me a damn woman

557
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,170
was also a desperate measure?

558
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,350
Did I?

559
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,910
You must have misheard

560
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,170
due to the strong wind.

561
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,030
Forget it.

562
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,650
Since you gave me wine in the snowstorm,

563
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,110
I'll let you off this time.

564
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,590
Mr. Huo,

565
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,300
please wait a moment at the valley entrance.

566
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,110
The wine...

567
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,370
You should thank our chief.

568
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,080
Laughing at the World has always been

569
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,470
exclusive for our chief.

570
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,530
She has never given it to anyone else.

571
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,470
Chief Xue, thank you

572
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,820
for gifting me the wine.

573
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,280
It's to repay you for the pot in the cave.

574
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,570
Looks like you still

575
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,170
are not used to owing favors.

576
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,230
I was hoping

577
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,420
you could

578
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,550
save me again in the future

579
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,280
for the sake of that pot of wine.

580
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,300
Mr. Seven, it's just your wishful thinking.

581
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,570
Indeed,

582
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,830
it's my wishful thinking.

583
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,150
I just gave you a pot of

584
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,360
ordinary Peach Wine.

585
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,420
But now, you're giving me

586
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,350
Apothecary Valley's unique wine.

587
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,470
So,

588
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,100
I've really got the better end of the deal.

589
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,480
Goodbye. Take care.

590
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,750
I'm serious.

591
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,370
If you are severely injured again, don't come back.

592
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,560
I don't have that much energy.
