1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,851
When do you think a rivalry begins?

4
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,021
Before humans are even born,

5
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,858
when sperm from the father's body

6
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,862
swim to reach the mother's egg,

7
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,739
that is the start of a rivalry.

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,284
But let's skip that
since those are just cells.

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,494
Is it your first race?

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,122
College entrance exam?

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,583
Job interview?

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,418
No.

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,672
It is said that Je-i's dad added a touch
of human effort to divine will

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,591
and had Je-i according to a plan.

15
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,052
He consulted the best fortune tellers
and astrologers in the country…

16
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,804
Yes.

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,641
…to choose the perfect date
for a C-section.

18
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,226
Starting anesthesia.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,063
Rescheduling the other mothers' surgeries

20
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,314
was nothing for him.

21
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,943
That is because Je-i's dad
was the hospital director.

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,154
CURRENT TIME 7 P.M.

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,365
So, from birth, Je-i pushed others aside

24
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,619
and was born
with the most auspicious fortune.

25
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,748
She was healthy, beautiful,
and full of talent.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,252
Most importantly,
her parents were wealthy.

27
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,713
Dance, music, painting, sports.

28
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,673
She rapidly progressed
at whatever she learned.

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,302
-Honey! Je-i is a genius.
-Everyone praised her except for one.

30
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,679
Je-i's father was the exception.

31
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,557
Whenever Je-i's mother
excitedly praised her talents…

32
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,101
What is her rank?

33
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,687
Where is she ranked?

34
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,441
So, where did she rank?

35
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,026
…that is what he'd say.

36
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,780
Honey.

37
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,494
Je-i won't be in the arts,
so don't get sidetracked.

38
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,038
Je-i had a one-year-older sister.

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:02,997
Great job.

40
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,167
She was academically gifted.

41
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,253
Before she even started elementary school,

42
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,089
she was easily solving
middle school math problems.

43
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,765
But Je-i was tenacious.

44
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,727
She didn't stop studying,
not even to use the bathroom.

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,772
She caught up to her sister's math level
in just six months.

46
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,114
Stop.

47
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,544
From now on, for every wrong answer,

48
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,880
one of you will hit the other's palms.

49
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,090
YU JE-NA

50
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,290
Why are you crying?

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,792
Didn't you want to surpass your sister?

52
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,085
I don't know.

53
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,130
I just don't want to hit her.

54
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,007
You don't? Why not?

55
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,676
I don't want her
to get hurt because of me.

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,221
Then do you want your sister
to hit you instead?

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,098
No.

58
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,934
I don't want that, either.

59
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,938
Je-i,

60
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,650
do you remember when our church pastor
preached about Cain and Abel?

61
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,445
Because God only accepted Abel's offering,

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,574
Cain took Abel to the field
and killed him.

63
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,745
From now on,
you'll be the target of everyone's envy,

64
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,289
including your own sister.

65
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,710
Does that mean Je-na will kill me?

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,504
Maybe.

67
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,382
Je-i had no intention

68
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,386
of letting her sister kill her.

69
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,012
Je-i, let's go to school together.

70
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,819
So, she did everything she could
to keep her distance from everyone.

71
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,074
Hey, Je-i.

72
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,660
-Hi.
-Hey.

73
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,161
Hey there.

74
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,595
Despite that, every so often,
unexpected things would happen.

75
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,946
YU JE-I

76
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,371
KWON DO-HUN

77
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,005
No one could penetrate Je-i's armor.

78
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,550
Who knows?
Maybe Je-i just didn't want to remove it.

79
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,389
God is our refuge and strength…

80
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,226
Je-i's family attended church every week.

81
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:57,523
That was the most boring part
of Je-i's whole week.

82
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,737
In general, people pray
to repent for their sins.

83
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,616
But she had no sins to speak of.

84
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,327
Then, she came to a realization.

85
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,999
In order to make this time meaningful,
she would have to do something bad.

86
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,420
That way, she would have something
to talk to God about.

87
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,414
The more she sinned,
the more she waited for Sundays.

88
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,127
Church even became fun.

89
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,962
Amen.

90
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,714
Je-i became addicted to the joy of prayer.

91
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,468
One day, she said
she received a revelation from God.

92
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,268
She had a dream.

93
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,107
In the dream, she was wearing armor
and jumped into the Hangang River.

94
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,244
Je-i was a great swimmer,
but it was useless.

95
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,330
The armor was just too heavy.

96
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,667
So, she sank straight to the bottom.

97
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,128
But to her surprise,

98
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,090
she said she felt a deep sense of peace.

99
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,052
She could breathe more easily than usual.

100
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,473
And the best part was

101
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,810
her sister couldn't kill her anymore.

102
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,647
She wouldn't have to commit Cain's sin.

103
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,736
She had finally found a way
to break free from her father's curse.

104
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,122
Get up. Come with me.

105
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,124
Where?

106
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,899
A HOSPITAL WITH TOP-QUALITY CARE
CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY'S HAPPINESS

107
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,507
It's okay. She's my friend.

108
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,884
-Is the director in?
-He's still working.

109
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,744
Here.

110
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,709
I set the humidity to 49%.

111
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,212
Good luck with your studies today.

112
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,488
You won't reject
my kindness again, will you?

113
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,953
Why are you being so nice to me?

114
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,291
Try it on first.

115
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,335
Then I'll tell you.

116
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,362
I'll do it myself.

117
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,994
How's the size? Does it fit?

118
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,621
Yes.

119
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,249
How did you know my size?

120
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,043
I hugged you. Remember?

121
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,048
I wanted to buy you shoes, too,

122
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,801
but I heard gifting shoes
makes the receiver run away.

123
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,056
Now tell me.

124
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,934
Why are you being nice to me?

125
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,897
Because I respect you.

126
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,233
I know

127
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,361
that you always ranked first
at your previous school.

128
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,906
You were able to do that
without any private tutoring.

129
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,659
I want to know your study tactics.

130
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,079
I guess you know a lot about me.

131
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,750
To be honest,

132
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,755
I thought all of you were just trying
to intimidate me on my first day.

133
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,383
-What about now?
-I don't know.

134
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,554
Maybe I was only able
to rank first without tutoring

135
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,141
because I was in a small town.

136
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,979
I don't think my method will work here.

137
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,274
Why are you doubting yourself?

138
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,818
I don't know any of the things
you all learn at cram schools.

139
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,278
That's why I was at Premium Academy--

140
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,947
How about this?

141
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,493
I'll share the materials I get
from cram school and tutoring,

142
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,454
and you can show me exactly how you study.

143
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,831
Every single detail.

144
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,042
-It's an unequal trade.
-What do you say?

145
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,504
Is this really all Je-i wants from me?

146
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,298
Hey, about Woo Seul-gi…

147
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,634
They'll throw a fit if they see you here.
Let's hide.

148
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,648
It's not a limited-edition luxury item.

149
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,233
Who wears a secondhand school uniform?

150
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,485
What a culture shock.

151
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:45,115
Why on earth did Je-i
pick a lowly bumpkin like her?

152
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,659
I know why.

153
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,786
She wants to gradually
train her with treats

154
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,663
and turn her into a loyal dog.

155
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,705
That's her hobby.

156
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,833
You're right.

157
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,212
-We're her servants, too.
-Do they mean me?

158
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,423
If you tell her she's smart, pretty,
and perfect, she eats it up.

159
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,885
If my dad spent all that fucking money
on me, and I got bad grades,

160
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,470
I'd have to be a total idiot.

161
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,639
And her face, too.

162
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,641
It's sick how she pretends
it's all natural.

163
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,187
Still, seeing that bumpkin
switch seats away from Je-i

164
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,314
was pretty satisfying.

165
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,857
Hey.

166
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,445
Even Woo Seul-gi's birth was atypical.

167
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,322
How so?

168
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,700
Her student record says she has no father.

169
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,122
On top of that, her mom is super young.

170
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,876
She must have gotten pregnant
in high school.

171
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,462
So, she was born out of wedlock?

172
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,799
I've never seen one in real life,
only in dramas.

173
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,303
What if she got kicked out
of her old school?

174
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,014
Maybe she takes after her mom.

175
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,474
Everyone hides who they really are.

176
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,560
Why does everyone have so many secrets?

177
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,189
Gyung, are you mad
because Je-i got private tutoring again?

178
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,110
Why won't she just share it with me?

179
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,570
Because she knows

180
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,781
you'd blow her off once you knew.

181
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,994
That wasn't me.

182
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,428
-What do we do now?
-I'm sorry.

183
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,864
That scared me.

184
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,950
You startled me.

185
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,078
JE-I: WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

186
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,872
WANT TO GRAB A BITE BEFORE CLASS?
MEET ME AT THE LOBBY CAFE

187
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,790
Damn it.

188
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,167
Eating makes me sleepy,
so I can't study well.

189
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,796
Just have some coffee.

190
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,382
I don't drink coffee anymore
because of my gastritis.

191
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,758
How about tea?

192
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,093
I hate the way it tastes.

193
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,281
If you take this elevator,
you won't run into them.

194
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,324
See you at school tomorrow.

195
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,037
By the way,
I've never had plastic surgery.

196
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,252
Je-i.

197
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,211
Yes?

198
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,438
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

199
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,212
What were you doing?

200
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,422
Waiting for you.

201
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,299
You got here early.

202
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,929
-What do you want to drink?
-We already ordered.

203
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,389
REST IN PEACE

204
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,104
What do I do now?

205
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,650
What do I do?

206
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,737
What now?

207
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,572
FUNERAL HALL

208
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,415
Excuse me, miss?

209
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,253
Your backpack is open.

210
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,633
I see.

211
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,427
Thank you.

212
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,560
Gyung has decided to apply
to a different department.

213
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,855
Choi Gyung, what about medical school?

214
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,817
Even if I became a doctor,
with the declining population,

215
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,112
the market just isn't as big anymore.

216
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,782
I want to study engineering
and be a patent attorney.

217
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,035
Gyung, you seem all grown up.

218
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,746
How do you know all that?

219
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,666
While you were busy scrolling through
celebrities' social media accounts,

220
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,711
I used my spare time
to read economic articles.

221
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,712
A patent attorney?

222
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,423
That's a decent plan.

223
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,009
Your parents work in law,
so they can definitely assist you.

224
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,470
You should spin your experience

225
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,099
in the medical club
as an interest in biotech patents.

226
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,394
Then I guess you don't need
to be class president this semester.

227
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,272
What do you mean?

228
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,943
Medical schools are
prioritizing character this year.

229
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,904
If you're going into engineering,
you don't need the title

230
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,489
of a hardworking class president.

231
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,911
Gyung, you have enough experience
as vice president.

232
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,455
As both, class and student body president,

233
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,876
Je-i has also proven her character
more than enough

234
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,919
that she could run
for the National Assembly.

235
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,463
So, don't waste your time. Got it?

236
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,426
Coach, getting elected
to the National Assembly

237
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,636
is based on popularity, not character.

238
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,318
Hello, princesses.

239
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,737
It must have been hard studying this late.

240
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,614
I'll escort you home safely.

241
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,698
Please get in.

242
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,367
What's the hold-up? Get in.

243
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,833
Please get in.

244
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,966
Gyung, how is your herniated disc pain?

245
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,012
You don't have to worry about me
when I know you're busy.

246
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,600
If you receive manual therapy
along with nerve blocks,

247
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,435
it'll be bearable without surgery
until the CSAT.

248
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,772
She doesn't wash her hair for three days
to have more time to study.

249
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,274
I doubt she'll have time for the hospital.

250
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,987
Still, getting rid of her pain
will help her study more efficiently.

251
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,531
Even if you're busy,
make time for a hospital visit.

252
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,033
Okay.

253
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,661
What about you, Princess Ye-ri?
How are you lately?

254
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,580
Of course, I'm doing great, thanks to you.

255
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,209
No side effects from the forehead filler
you got over break?

256
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,710
You got more filler?

257
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,045
Goodness.

258
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,756
It must be looking so natural
for no one to notice.

259
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,509
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

260
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,972
Excuse me, Mr. Yu.
You can drop us off at the next crosswalk.

261
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,516
Why? I can drop you off at home.

262
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,143
I want to stop by a convenience store
for a bite with Ye-ri.

263
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,312
With me?

264
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,324
-Bye.
-Thank you.

265
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,373
Do you want to bulk up
now that you're a senior?

266
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,582
What will you eat now?

267
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,251
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

268
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,419
About what?

269
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,838
I feel weird every time I see Je-i's dad.

270
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,549
-He makes me uneasy.
-What are you saying?

271
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,468
Have you heard anything
about Je-i's sister?

272
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,595
Did the upperclassmen say anything?

273
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,723
I'm sure she's busy studying
to retake the exam.

274
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,349
Do you think so?

275
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,060
Damn it.

276
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,024
Gyung has become so determined
now that she's a senior.

277
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,943
She's giving up on medical school.

278
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,613
She made a list of engineering schools
with our advisor earlier.

279
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,658
Rather than moving from place to place
as a contract doctor,

280
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,077
it's better to be a patent attorney
from Hankuk University.

281
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,372
She knows her place.

282
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,543
How did you know
she wanted to be a patent attorney?

283
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,054
What do engineering graduates do
besides patent law these days?

284
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,348
That's true.

285
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,145
I hear the new transfer student
is quite smart.

286
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,025
She isn't good enough
for you to worry about, Dad.

287
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,028
But wasn't she top of her class
every year at her old school?

288
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,406
Don't mind her.
She's nowhere near my level.

289
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,621
U-TURN ALLOWED ON LEFT TURN SIGNAL

290
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,344
We should have let Mr. Yu drive us home.

291
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,012
Call your chauffeur.

292
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,265
He already clocked out for the day.

293
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,101
It's so late.

294
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,702
Who do you think we are?

295
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,246
No, not you.

296
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,164
It's for her.

297
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,041
What is it?

298
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,670
I'll report you and your business
for soliciting minors.

299
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,838
Call me.

300
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,971
Are you seriously smiling right now?

301
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,557
You know what kind
of business card this is, right?

302
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,433
Of course, I do.

303
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,978
It's not my first time getting one.

304
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,272
Doesn't it disgust you?
Or are you just brainless?

305
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,107
Gyung.

306
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,693
You only get these if you're pretty.

307
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,027
Have you ever gotten one?

308
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,157
Gosh, you're so delusional, Ju Ye-ri.

309
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,534
I'm just being honest.
It says it right here.

310
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,244
"Ten percent."

311
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,123
Being in the top 10% of looks and body
in the Republic of Korea?

312
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,042
That's no easy feat.

313
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,506
-Ye-ri.
-I'll be off.

314
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,433
Damn it.

315
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,127

Excuse me, miss?

321
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,913
Your backpack is open.

322
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,627
I'm sorry for your loss.

323
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,181
I'm Yu Tae-jun, the surgeon
who operated on Woo Do-hyeok.

324
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,350
The patient arrived at our hospital

325
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,853
already unconscious due to acute sepsis.

326
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,480
He was unable to breathe on his own.

327
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,026
Our medical team did everything we could,
but unfortunately…

328
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,489
-Ma'am.
-Escort her to the VIP ward.

329
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,825
Administer a sedative and vitamin IV.

330
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,744
Yes, sir. Move her now.

331
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:22,474
REST IN PEACE

332
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,398
Dad.

333
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,784
How did I feel
when I found my father after 13 years,

334
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,410
only for him to die?

335
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,454
I wasn't sad at all.

336
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,458
Of course, I wondered
why I couldn't have a family

337
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,627
just like everyone else.

338
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,213
It was that moment.

339
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,218
That was when you, Yu Je-i,
who looked like you had the entire world,

340
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,304
appeared before me.

341
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,202
BULL'S-EYE PREMIUM ACADEMY WORKBOOK

342
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,409
I'll give you one, too. Take it.

343
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,537
Thanks.

344
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,428
Kim Na-ri wasn't at yesterday's
end-of-day meeting.

345
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,930
Has she given up on college?

346
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,475
One absence can lower your grade
by three levels.

347
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,727
One student council title
can raise it by three levels.

348
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,689
We'll elect a class president later.
Volunteer if you're interested.

349
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,067
That is all.

350
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,128
Hey, Je-i.

351
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,423
Can I sit here?
