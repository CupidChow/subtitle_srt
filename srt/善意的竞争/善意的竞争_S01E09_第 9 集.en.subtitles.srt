1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,485
The truth is, Je-na knew the right answer.

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,364
Stop.

5
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,868
From now on, for every wrong answer,

6
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,412
one of you will hit the other's palms.

7
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,956
She simply chose to get hit

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,000
rather than hit Je-i.

9
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,045
I can't live like this anymore. I won't!

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,590
I told you divorce isn't an option.

11
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,966
You need treatment.

12
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,261
-Je-na.
-Don't treat me like a patient.

13
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,055
Please, let's separate.

14
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,347
What about the kids?

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,099
I'll take Je-i.

16
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,559
That won't do.

17
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,228
Je-i is the future of the hospital.

18
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,980
I'll let you have Je-na.

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,608
AWARD FOR SURGICAL SKILL

20
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,362
Je-na.

21
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,031
Your foot is bleeding.

22
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,705
Je-i, let's get ready for kindergarten.

23
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,790
Okay.

24
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,752
That little girl bent over backwards

25
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,046
so her parents wouldn't abandon her.

26
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,549
Eat up.

27
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,218
She must've believed

28
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,429
she had to excel
to keep her family together.

29
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,347
Here.

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,016
It's the so-called Big Sister Syndrome.

31
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,525
Je-i, wait for me.

32
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,653
Je-i, let's go to school together.

33
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,333
Once Je-na came to the realization

34
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,169
that her sister didn't need her anymore,

35
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,257
she began to pray to God
for something else.

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,718
God is our refuge and strength,

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,471
an ever-present help in trouble.

38
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,722
Therefore, we will not fear…

39
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,725
She prayed to God
to give her an incurable illness.

40
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,521
She asked for help
to make her parents and sister

41
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,607
feel pity for her.

42
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,744
Je-na.

43
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,506
What is the cause?

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,675
There's no specific cause for narcolepsy.

45
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,343
Are you sure it's narcolepsy?

46
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,012
It's hard to be sure.

47
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,848
Let's give her medication
and see if she improves.

48
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:05,977
Thanks.

49
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,897
You must be busy with your studies,

50
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,773
but you even brought Je-yun.

51
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,027
It'd be a problem
if you collapsed in the street again,

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,069
so take Je-yun with you.

53
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,529
I don't want to.

54
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,073
Don't you know how dangerous cataplexy is?

55
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,658
Instead of Je-yun,

56
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,829
you can stay with me, Je-i.

57
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,415
I have to go to the cram school.

58
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,083
Forget it.

59
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,376
Give Je-yun back.

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,921
Come on, Je-yun. Let's go.

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,805
How are you feeling?

62
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,267
I'm much less drowsy,

63
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,977
and my mind is more clear.

64
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,520
I can feel the improvement.

65
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,856
I'm glad the medication is working.

66
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,692
You must've had a hard time
dealing with unwanted sleep.

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,527
I had no idea.

68
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,739
I'd be so disappointed
to see you doze off while studying.

69
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,366
Both as a father and a doctor,

70
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,117
I've failed you, haven't I?

71
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,037
I sincerely apologize.

72
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,539
It's okay, Dad.

73
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,291
You don't have to apologize.

74
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,960
Don't blame yourself.

75
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,379
Now that we know the cause,

76
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,298
you'll be able to study
even better than before.

77
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,883
If you improve your math scores,

78
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,678
I believe you can be
the top student in your year.

79
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,179
You can be on top, too, like Je-i.

80
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,807
Je-na didn't expect this turn of events.

81
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,977
As your father,
I'll give you my full support.

82
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,980
In our last class,

83
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,441
we learned about graphs and values
of exponential functions.

84
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,111
Now, we're going to move them around.

85
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,113
What are some ways to move these figures?

86
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,615
There are shifts and reflections, right?

87
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,326
Now, let's transform this function…

88
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,704
The actual meaning of "full support"

89
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,791
was that he would be keeping
a much closer eye on her.

90
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,252
So, the basics of exponential functions…

Je-na,

93
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,557
you can leave early
if you're still not feeling well.

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,684
Or do you want to rest
in the nurse's office?

95
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,185
Mr. Woo.

96
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,353
Yes?

97
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,439
This Hankuk University key chain…

98
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,608
Can I have it?

99
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,069
If I have this,

100
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,405
I feel like
I can get a perfect score in math

101
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,490
and be the top student of the school.

You didn't call my dad, did you?

112
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,728
No, not yet.

113
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,231
Are you feeling okay?

114
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,526
What are you going to do?

115
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,153
I'm still thinking.

116
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,451
If you let this slide, then I can live.

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,412
If not, I'll just die right here.

118
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,581
-Is that a threat?
-No.

119
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,708
I'm just stating the facts.

120
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,169
I'll wait for your decision.

121
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,387
Let me ask one thing.

122
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,097
Was it your first time doing this?

123
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:54,974
Yes.

124
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,478
The Je-na that I know

125
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,272
is quite smart, kind, and beautiful.

126
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,690
You're also honorable.

127
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,984
So, can I ask
why you went to such lengths?

128
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,628
Please don't give up on me.

129
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,047
What did you say?

130
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,257
Don't…

131
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,134
Don't give up on me.

132
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,135
Okay.

133
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,845
I'll never give up on you, Je-na.

134
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,263
So, don't--

135
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,685
That was a promise, okay?

136
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,449
Je-na?

137
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,035
Je-i, what are you doing here?

138
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,412
Me? What about you--

139
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,788
So, you know it, too.

140
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,124
That Dad killed Mr. Woo.

141
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,458
What?

142
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,379
That's Mr. Woo's phone, right?

143
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,590
Give it to me.

144
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,427
What are you doing?

145
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,440
Are you kidding me?

146
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,650
Yu Je-na!

147
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,454
Who is that over there?

148
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,765
Are you a Hoegyeong High School student?

149
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,600
What are you doing here?

150
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,768
Hey.

151
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,102
Seul-gi!

152
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,610
Gosh, what do we do?

153
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,612
Oh, dear.

154
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,781
Call 911!

155
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,873
Do it quickly.

156
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,220
This is an announcement.

157
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,971
The festival is now over.

158
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,599
Students, return to your classrooms now.

159
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,810
Parents and other attendees,

160
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,063
proceed to the auditorium
and await further instructions.

161
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,357
Again, this is an announcement.

162
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,817
The festival is now over.

163
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,776
-Stay calm.
-Let us out.

164
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,238
Everyone on school grounds
must follow our instructions.

165
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,575
Students, please remain calm
and return to your classrooms now.

166
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,827
-Wait.
-Please.

167
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,961
What is it?

168
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,796
What happened?

169
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,007
Seul-gi got hurt.

170
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,926
Seul-gi?

171
00:11:59,009 --> 00:11:59,885
How bad is it?

172
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,513
Where is she now?

173
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,974
-Your dad took her--
-Damn it.

174
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,072
Need a hand?

175
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,086
Where the fuck are the bandages?

176
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,183
In here.

177
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,977
Turn on the lights.

178
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,733
Sit down for a second.

179
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,114
Kim Beom-su, get it together.

180
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,492
Answer my questions properly.

181
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,993
Have you been drinking?

182
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,997
Then, are you on drugs?

183
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,930
Contact Beom-su's parents
and tell our legal team to come in.

184
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,598
-Quickly.
-Yes, ma'am.

185
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,354
-We're assessing the situation.
-Don't worry, ma'am.

186
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,813
-It's not our school.
-One moment.

187
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,814
Of course, it's not.

188
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,566
It's not our school.

189
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,026
Stop!

190
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,403
No one answers the phone.

191
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,959
People from Seoul are so damn…

192
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,426
-Oh, hello.
-A student from my school came in, right?

193
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,553
What is their name?

194
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,638
Where's my dad?

195
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,269
Are you just going to stand there?

196
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,413
Do you want to try?

197
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,876
Once you're given the chance
to see how it feels,

198
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,587
your commitment to medical school
will become even stronger.

199
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:43,567
In the first year of pre-med,
you practice suturing on pig skin.

200
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,320
But it's too thick
and inconsistent in quality.

201
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,571
It's frustrating.

202
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,865
It doesn't feel like your expectations.

203
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,118
Then, in the second year,
you use donated cadavers

204
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,871
and try it for the first time
on real human skin.

205
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,415
When you pull the thread,

206
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,001
the feeling is so smooth and elastic.

207
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,170
That night,

208
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,839
my hands kept tingling,
so I couldn't sleep.

209
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,428
But this friend of yours,
who grew up in an orphanage,

210
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,514
has a skin with thin fat layers.

211
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,058
There's no elasticity.

212
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,519
Malnutrition during your growth phase
can cause this.

213
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,024
But since she's your friend,

214
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,071
I'll take extra care
so it won't leave a scar.

215
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,453
Can you bring me those forceps?

216
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,999
SANITARY PADS

217
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,180
Damn it.

218
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,189
Not just marijuana is banned.

219
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,232
No vapes, either, Gu Chae-ryeong.

220
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,233
Got it?

221
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,490
Ms. Kim, that's digestive medicine.

222
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,284
Don't carry it personally.
Get it from the nurse's office.

223
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,203
Vice President.

224
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,579
Open up all the lockers.

225
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,258
What about the students who aren't here?

226
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,886
Should I break the locks?

227
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225
Leave them for now.

228
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,235
WOO SEUL-GI, YU JE-I
KIM BEOM-SU

229
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,454
You still have a habit of operating
without the guardian's consent.

230
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,250
Were you only going to call
after something went wrong again?

231
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,669
First, my husband,
and now, my stepdaughter.

232
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,797
And you call yourself a doctor?

233
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,676
I want her transferred.

234
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,762
If you find a hospital to take her
at this late hour, go ahead.

235
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,014
However, since we
just finished stitching her up,

236
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,225
there is a risk of infection.

237
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,310
So, you'll need to sign a waiver first.

238
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,940
Escort Woo Seul-gi to the VIP ward.

00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,664
About what?

254
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,166
Where on earth are you?

255
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,043
Did you read my texts?

256
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,919
Things are worse than we thought.

257
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,589
Why the fuss? Did you stab Seul-gi?

258
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,008
No, Beom-su did.

259
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,510
She stabbed Seul-gi while high on drugs.

260
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,471
What if they find out we sold them?

261
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,557
"We"?

262
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,942
I told you not to do any deals in person.

263
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,112
You're the one who went
and sold to Beom-su directly.

264
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,323
What do you mean, "we"?

265
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,617
-Watch your mouth.
-Regardless,

266
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,202
I was just the seller.

267
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,996
You're the one who supplied the drugs.

268
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,498
Think carefully.

269
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,250
The only person
who knows I supplied the pills

270
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,127
is you.

271
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,172
But there are plenty of kids
who got your paper cranes

272
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,758
and bought pills directly from you, right?

273
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,761
Don't worry or get ahead of yourself.

274
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,806
Just do as I say and keep your mouth shut.

275
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,641
This will all be over soon.

276
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,558
There's one more.

277
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,685
Woo Seul-gi.

278
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,022
Didn't you sell directly to Woo Seul-gi?

279
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,441
Can you trust her?

280
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,568
If she talks,

281
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,403
both of us are fucked.

282
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,457
SEUL-GI'S LOCATION: J MEDICAL CENTER

283
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,558
You've never ranked first,
so I knew you weren't the smartest.

284
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,185
But, Choi Gyung, were you this stupid?

285
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,062
Why are you bringing that up now?

286
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,653
Jeez, can you stop?

287
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,160
You saw how the school responded.

288
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,412
They're trying to cover up a stabbing

289
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,581
when the evidence is clear.

290
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,082
The police should know.

291
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,376
Don't breathe a word of this to anyone.

292
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,337
-Mom.
-Under no circumstances

293
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,591
will I let you
jeopardize your college admissions.

294
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,842
Do as I say.

295
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,343
Got it?

296
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,391
Aren't you ashamed
as someone who works in law?

297
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,768
I'm doing this
because I know the law too well.

298
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,228
Get out.

00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,676
Why do you keep lying to me?

314
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,469
You always leave me out.

315
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,846
SHE GOT DOXXED

316
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,431
I'D BE TOO SCARED TO GO TO SCHOOL

317
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,349
I WONDER WHO WAS BEHIND IT

318
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,726
NO ONE'S BEHIND IT
SHE HAD SELF-HARM PHOTOS

319
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,185
I BET SOMEONE WAS BEHIND IT

320
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,281
Seul-gi, are you okay?

321
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,577
Isn't it painful?

322
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,413
The sutures were done well.
It'll heal quickly.

323
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,296
It's stuffy in here.

324
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,840
Do you want to go outside
for a bit with Je-yun?

325
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,482
Hey, what is it?

326
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,991
Sometimes, I imagine Je-yun dying.

327
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,702
What?

328
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,538
I'm afraid I'll be too sad
when Je-yun really dies,

329
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,750
so I imagine it in advance
to prepare myself.

330
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,590
Lately, I've been imagining

331
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,134
your death a lot, too.

332
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,702
By the way, have you seen my phone?

333
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,954
What?

334
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,625
Not this one.

335
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,294
Technically, it's my dad's phone.

336
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,213
I lost it.

337
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,551
How did that happen?

338
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,929
I haven't even figured out the PIN yet.

339
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,600
Come to think of it,

340
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,145
you must've known my dad, too.

341
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,356
I never took his class.

342
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:55,984
But…

343
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,530
I don't think he was a good person.

344
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,199
Why not?

345
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,328
There were rumors
that he slept with students.

346
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,666
No way.

347
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,794
I'll pretend I never heard that.

348
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,879
Why?

349
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,922
Isn't it better this way?

350
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,343
You'd feel even more upset
if he had been a great person.

351
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,012
What?

352
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,613
You're really pathetic.

353
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,909
Not everyone lives like you, Yu Je-i.

357
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,399
Is the hospital treating you well?

358
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,778
The Internet is blowing up with the secret
behind Chaehwa's high success rates.

359
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,866
I have a great business plan.
Do you want to hear it?

360
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,910
As you already know,

361
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,537
I'm in the hospital right now.

00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,881
Anyway, can't you really get

00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,259
Damn it, where the fuck is she?

367
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,311

368
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,938
