1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,972
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,727
There's a typical image that adults
consider to be a model student.

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,691
And they presume that these model students

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,317
have zero sexual desires.

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,114
Back in the Joseon period,
when a girl was only 16 years old,

7
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,366
they made a fuss
about not having any children.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,619
And they brought more concubines
when they already had a crown princess.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,371
What do you think that means?

10
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,415
When they were as old
as today's eighth graders,

11
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,834
they had sex,
had children, and everything.

12
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,087
Your Majesty.

13
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,259
Just because life expectancy has increased

14
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:55,597
doesn't mean the energetic teenage years
are pushed back.

15
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:56,973
Your Majesty!

16
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,853
The whole world seems to be tolerant
about teenage boys jerking off.

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,229
Oh, dear.

18
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:04,981
But girls…

19
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,777
Especially female model students.

20
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,904
What's it like for them?

21
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,907
Even castrated eunuchs
have sexual desire and curiosity.

22
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,743
And they act like we don't have those.

23
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,967
This was when Gyung realized
that she was mature for her age.

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,410
As if possessed by a perverted spirit,

25
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,579
she was consumed by dirty thoughts.

26
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,750
She couldn't handle
her vigorous curiosity,

27
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,044
so she ended up opening those gates.

28
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:08,962
However,

29
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,340
what awaited her was
an unexpected challenge.

30
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,634
"Which elementary school
did I graduate from?"

31
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,302
"My mother's name?"

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,930
What kind of idiot came up
with these questions?

33
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,391
Who in their right mind
would answer questions

34
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,642
that can identify them?

35
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,061
"My favorite character?"

36
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,230
No one would admit to being a geek.

37
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,899
"Where was my first kiss?"

38
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,153
How rude.

39
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,405
What if I've never had my first kiss?

40
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,167
"My seatmate's name in elementary school?"

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,043
Elementary school is six years long,

42
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,963
and there are at least 12 of them
if we switch seats every semester.

43
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,048
Whose name do they want me to type?

44
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,218
ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS, GRADE 5

45
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,307
Simply solving a lot of workbooks
doesn't get you better grades.

46
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,893
You have to study
based on school textbooks.

47
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,477
NAME: IM HYEON-JI
GPA RANKING: 1ST IN SCHOOL

48
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,897
NOTE: HAS NO FRIENDS

49
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,649
Your art academy instructor
must have done this part.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,067
The brushstrokes are clearly different.

51
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,193
It's so obvious.

52
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,279
-I don't go to any art academies.
-Really?

53
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,740
You should, then.

54
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,161
-Come here!
-They're fighting.

55
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,787
-Punch her.
-Stop!

56
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,122
Shouldn't we stop them?

57
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,751
Sadly, Hyeon-ji is going
to study abroad in England.

58
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,669
I'm sure you're all sad to see her leave.

59
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,505
Hyeon-ji, do you want
to say goodbye to your friends?

60
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,637
I hear they like smart people in England.

61
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,641
She was fleeing abroad
because her dad's business went down,

62
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,851
but she was still arrogant.

63
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,520
Now that the hated first placer was gone,

64
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,650
Gyung believed
that she could take her place.

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,989
But as you know,

66
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,991
life never goes as you expect.

67
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,205
Je-i was pretty,
but she also got good grades.

68
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,083
Gyung!

69
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,793
Gyung!

70
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,920
Moreover, she was popular among kids.

71
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,046
Gyung.

72
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,464
Name, Yu Je-i.

73
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,133
Yu Je-i is appointed
as the student body president

74
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,010
for the second semester of 2018.

75
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,138
For Gyung, it sucked more
to have Je-i as a rival

76
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,890
than Hyeon-ji…

77
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,058
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

78
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,643
…but she couldn't show it.

79
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,145
Why?

80
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,898
I will do my best this semester

81
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,109
with the vice president, Choi Gyung.

82
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,860
Until then,

83
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,529
the two were a perfect team.

84
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,960
Gyung, what are you doing after school?
Grab tteokbokki with me later?

85
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,214
NAME: JUNG HA-JIN
GPA RANKING: UNKNOWN

86
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,758
NOTE: MOST POPULAR BOY IN SERA ELEMENTARY

87
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,548
-You know--
-You know--

88
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,383
-I have a favor--
-I have a qu--

89
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:44,969
You can go first.

90
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,846
No, you go first.

91
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,807
It's not that important.

92
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,227
But can you give me Je-i's phone number?

93
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,732
I'm actually into her.

94
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,817
Being a sidekick and a second.

95
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,028
She's pretty tall for a girl,

96
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,947
and she's definitely my type.

97
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,909
But you and Je-i are close,

98
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,078
so do your friend a favor.

99
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,580
I'll be waiting. I trust you.

100
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,873
Sideline, side-effect,

101
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,334
side job, sidecar, second prize,
vice president, vice class president,

102
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,627
and vice student body president.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,255
Gyung felt like the word "side"
attached to her forehead

104
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,091
would never come off,

105
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,760
and it made her feel tragic.

106
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,678
Second to everything.

107
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,889
It meant that she'd be
second best in everything.

108
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,724
MY SEATMATE'S NAME IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

Why did you transfer here, Seul-gi?

116
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,202
I know that you always ranked first
at your previous school.

117
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,497
I guess you know a lot about me.

118
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,166
Did you like princess dresses, too?

119
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:07,213
I never imagined
you suffered that kind of pain.

120
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,758
Thanks for telling me
such a difficult story.

Ma'am, did you check
Je-i's new diet starting tomorrow?

143
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,050
Yes.

144
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,677
Make sure to keep the order
of protein and carbs.

145
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,263
Arrange the premeal medication
from B12, please.

146
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,681
Yes, Mr. Yu.

147
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,602
Why isn't your friend coming down?
She should have breakfast.

148
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,106
You didn't kick her out, did you?

149
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,358
Why would I kick out an important guest?

150
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,575
She's been waiting for Je-na.

151
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,786
Why isn't she here yet?

152
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,123
She must be ashamed of failing the CSAT.

153
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,792
She has to retake it
in the same year as you.

154
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,502
She won't be able to focus here.

155
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,879
You need to understand her.

156
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,965
Is that what she wants?

157
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,426
You know, not coming home.

158
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,469
Yes.

159
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,763
And that she hasn't called once?

160
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,683
I guess she set her mind to it this time.

161
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,480
Tell Yu Je-na

162
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,733
that she'll never be able to beat me.

163
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,331
Ju Ye-ri.

164
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,835
How come you're walking to school
in sneakers today?

165
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:39,300
I listened to the great Gyung's advice.
Walking sounded like the best exercise.

166
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,220
Yes. It's never a bad idea
to take my advice.

167
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,097
By the way, you look happy for once.

168
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,601
I thought the class president election
would've ruined your mood for a week.

169
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,895
I have found a strong supplement

170
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,105
that will put me in a good mood.

00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,402
Is that Na-ri?

173
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,780
I guess it's true.

174
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,325
What?

175
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,952
The new replaces the old.

176
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,163
What's that?

177
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,514
Guys, Kim Na-ri is transferring.

178
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,141
She's in the teachers' office
with her mom.

179
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,893
-Seriously? Why?
-Why?

180
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,023
Woo Seul-gi.

181
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,733
Wait for me.

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,113
You didn't even say hi to me.
Where are you going?

183
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,783
-The teachers' office.
-Why?

184
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,993
To get the attendance book.

185
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,665
Why did you leave
without a goodbye last night?

186
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,417
-My mom called.
-Oh, I thought…

187
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,044
You thought what?

188
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,922
I thought you left because you didn't want
to come to school with me.

189
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,632
It's not like that.

190
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,220
You made a tough decision, ma'am.

191
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,014
Why is Na-ri transferring out of the blue?

192
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,724
I'm not sure.

193
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,310
Should we go tell her goodbye?

194
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,562
Do you want to?

195
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,527
Na-ri.

196
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,488
-Yes?
-I heard you were transferring.

197
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,741
I thought we were becoming friends.
It's too bad.

198
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,286
Me too.

199
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,203
Goodbye.

200
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,873
Cut down on social media
if you want to go to a good college.

201
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,374
All right?

202
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,292
Okay.

203
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,177
Yu Je-i?

204
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,272
Choi Gyung.

205
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,945
Kim Beom-su.

206
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,952
How will you perform in real interviews
by copying everything

207
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,412
from the Internet?

208
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,541
Cho A-ra.

209
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,756
Yeonseo University is putting more weight
on their interviews.

210
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,549
This cliché story doesn't stand a chance.

211
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,721
I didn't see
any extracurricular competencies.

212
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,681
Nor did they move my heart.

213
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,183
How will you manage this?

214
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,894
There was one good one.

215
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,691
-Whose essay was it?
-Your class president.

216
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,904
Sir!

217
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,238
Read us Seul-gi's essay.

218
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,700
Originality and career motivation.

219
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,285
It was an excellent essay,

220
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,080
which I would recommend all of you
to check out.

221
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,625
But an essay is private writing,

222
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,502
so that…

223
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,088
That's a no.

224
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,090
Girls.

225
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,051
Try writing your own dramatic story.

226
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,470
Or ask your coaches to make one up.

227
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,597
No need to bow.

228
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,065
What did you write in your essay

229
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,275
for our Korean teacher
to praise this much?

230
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,241
Wait. You won't even show me?

231
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,743
It's nothing major.

232
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,745
Je-i.

233
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,664
What grade did you get?

234
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,501
Why do you want to know that?

235
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,379
I might feel better
to know that I wasn't the only one

236
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,715
who didn't get an A-plus.

237
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,175
Shouldn't we all

238
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,595
get a special lecture from Seul-gi?

239
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,472
I'm in. I'll attend if you're doing one.

240
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,933
-Me too!
-I want one, too, Seul-gi.

241
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,520
You might want to keep
your essay hidden, Seul-gi.

242
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,231
Let's go get lunch.

243
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,196
What do you want?
Are you not happy with your grade?

244
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,823
Not that.

245
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,703
I must humbly accept
the grade you gave me.

246
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,288
So, what is it?

247
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,750
I need an early dismissal slip
from my homeroom teacher.

248
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,085
-I have a lesson.
-I think she's having lunch.

249
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,837
I'll wait, then.

250
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,005
By the way,

251
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,133
your new hairstyle suits you perfectly.

252
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,470
Ye-ri, even your essay
was full of so much pretense.

253
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,348
-You're not that different in real life.
-What do you mean by "pretense"?

254
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,100
Gossip, maybe.

255
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,560
Ms. Lee.

256
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,812
-Do you want to get lunch with me?
-Sure.

257
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,732
"Gossip"? Don't be silly.

ESSAY FOR SPEECH AND WRITING
WOO SEUL-GI

260
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,027
What is it, Seul-gi? What's wrong?

261
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,867
What's the problem?
Did you lose something?

262
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,620
My essay.

263
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,705
It's gone.

264
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,513
Stop.

265
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,515
Again.

266
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,402
Stop.

267
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,821
Again.

268
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,787
Stop.

269
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,917
I can't listen to this anymore.

270
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,212
-I'm going to leave now.
-I'm sorry?

271
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,884
You have no intention
of going to college for the harp.

272
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,926
That's not true.

273
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,890
Open your hand.

274
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,187
Your hands are spotless
for someone who claims to play the harp.

275
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,813
Your hands

276
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,942
will look perfect
with some nail art and jewelry.

277
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,486
Don't expect me to come back here.

278
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,532
I'm sorry, Professor.
I'll practice harder.

279
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,368
They'll kill me if I don't go to college.

280
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,287
Kill you?

281
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,708
Then, you and your parents should act
like your life depends on it.

282
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,754
If they have the money
to buy you a luxury bag,

283
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,256
it's common sense
to send the lesson fees on time.

284
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,883
Pardon?

285
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,926
Make sure to tell them

286
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,137
to send the overdue lesson fees
by the end of the week.

287
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,941
You know the resale value
of this bag, right?

288
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,067
Take it for now.

289
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,991
You can give it back
when they wire the money next week.

290
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,787
I'm only looking after it

291
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,289
because I feel bad about your situation.

292
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,500
I know that.

293
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,335
Thank you.

294
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,638
Fuck, this is why

295
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,432
a person needs designer bags.

303
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,033
Don't read it.

304
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,578
No one reads Seul-gi's essay
without my permission. Do you understand?

305
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,833
Je-i.

306
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,711
Can we talk for a minute?

307
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,592
I'm going to find out who did this.

308
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,179
I'll find who copied
and handed out your essay,

309
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,346
no matter what.

310
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,267
Why?

311
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,019
Why would you do that?

312
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,772
What do you mean? Doesn't it offend you?

313
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,814
It does.

314
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,941
But not as much as it offends you.

315
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,569
Why are you so offended?

316
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,653
This is about you--

317
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,654
Answer it.

318
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,327
PRINCESS

319
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,541
Are you upset that my troubled past,
which only you used to know,

320
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,085
is now out in the open?

321

MISSING CHILD
NAME: WOO SEUL-GI

322
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,134
You knew all about it.

323
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,345
That I grew up in an orphanage,

324
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,972
and that my dad was Woo Do-hyeok,
who used to teach here.

325
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,400
Damn it, what the hell?

326
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,195
Oh, no.

327
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,573
I made a mistake. I was only going
to take one strand of hair.

328
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,283
What?

329
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,744
I recently got a tip.

330
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,081
So, I'm going to get
this hair tested to confirm.

331
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,541
What are you talking about?

332
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,712
Na-ri, there's a rumor that you're a user.

333
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,755
Je-i.

334
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,551
If I send this to my hospital,
I'll get to see what drugs you're on.

335
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,802
Right?

336
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,599
Hey!

337
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,102
Hey, Na-ri.

338
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,522
Oh, dear. Your uniform will get dirty.

339
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,315
It's fine. I can wash it.

340
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,654
You admitted it so easily
that I won't need a hair test.

341
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,117
What title should I use
to get more views on social media?

342
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,787
Why don't you come up with a title?
It's your specialty.

343
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,164
Je-i, please.

344
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,420
That's what you get

345
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,006
for messing with my stuff
without knowing your place.

346
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,851
That means you knew it all and still
tested me in the teachers' office.

347
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,692
But wasn't it gratifying to see Na-ri

348
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,819
admit her fault right away?

349
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,614
-Je-i, you can't be…
-Seul-gi.

350
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,993
You shouldn't be getting angry with me.
You should be thanking me.

351
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,829
I took care of a jerk

352
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,497
who was bullying you.

353
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,962
That's not the point.

354
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,380
Isn't it?

355
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,341
