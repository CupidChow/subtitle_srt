Hands on your heads, now.

10
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,294

RANK 1: CHOI GYUNG

14
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,003
Nice job, Gyung.

15
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,881
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

16
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,382
Your grades are up to par.

17
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,217
Ace the early admission interview,

18
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,595
and you'll get into Hankuk Medical School.

19
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,846
Congratulations, Gyung.

20
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,100
Your true skills
have finally come to light.

21
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,728
With these grades, you should give up
on Hankuk Medical School.

22
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,188
Don't you need a scholarship?

23
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,776
Only one harp student
gets in early to Hankuk Music School.

24
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,570
Will you apply or not?

25
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,364
It's unlike you
to make such a mistake, Je-i.

26
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,700
Did you fill in the wrong answers?

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,161
Your recent loss hit you hard.

28
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,288
That's understandable.

29
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,625
There's always regular admission,
so go all-in on the CSAT.

REPORT CARD

31
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,807
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,059
RANKED 15 OUT OF 189

33
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,691
I have a favor to ask.

34
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,196
Help me like you helped Je-na.

35
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,449
I need the killer problem.

36
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,023
Ma'am.

37
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,441
Did you buy a new car?

38
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,651
Yes.

39
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,319
Let me explain.

40
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,638
Where is the evidence you kept here?

41
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,350
I settled the lawsuit.

42
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,858
I'm exhausted now.

43
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,570
I don't want to be disappointed
by your dad anymore.

44
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,114
Or maybe you only wanted
the money from the start.

45
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,495
Between us two,

46
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,831
who do you think is struggling more?

47
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,171
Of course.

48
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,007
I have no right to argue.

49
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,098
That's right.

50
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,351
It's rare to climb the ranks
in senior year.

51
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,062
SCHOOL RANK: 1 OUT OF 189

52
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,023
Please, no need for congratulations.

53
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,816
Gosh, really?

54
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,944
Where's your old hiking gear?

55
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,238
Put it on. Hurry.

56
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,573
Right now?

57
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,789
Almost there.

58
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,796
PRAYER RECEPTION FOR 100 DAYS TO CSAT

59
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,922
Hurry up.

60
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,381
WE WISH YOU GOOD RESULTS

61
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,034
We can't keep making chump change.
The CSAT is only 100 days away.

62
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,541
Maybe it's because
the students can't take these.

63
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,209
The ranks were a mess this time.

64
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,710
Really? Even Woo Seul-gi?

65
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,046
I'm not sure if she was
even in the top 20.

66
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,923
Then, who ranked first this time?

67
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,258
Choi Gyung.

68
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,884
That's her name.

69
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,511
Oh, I see.

70
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,471
The model student I gave fentaryn to?

71
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,737
Hey.

72
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,364
The madam wants to see you.

73
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,533
Me?

74
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,206
CHRISTIAN COLUMBARIUM

75
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,264
YU JE-NA

76
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,378
Are you okay?

77
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,423
Did you sacrifice sleep
to beat the other students?

78
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,217
I'm impressed.

79
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,683
Maintaining first place
is even harder than getting it.

80
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,978
Look at Seul-gi.

81
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,065
Her grades dropped once she stopped using.

82
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:49,153
So, Woo Seul-gi really came in first
because she took drugs?

83
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,030
The CSAT is coming up soon.

84
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,533
Take these.

85
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,159
It's a gift from me to you.

86
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,209
Open it. I heard today's your birthday.

87
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,462
That means you're not a minor anymore.

88
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,967
You seem to have caught the eye
of one of our regulars.

89
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,428
I can loan you money
for living expenses and tuition.

90
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,889
It's time you start earning your keep.

91
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,227
YU JE-NA

92
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,530
Hand it over.

93
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,698
I don't want to.

94
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,242
You can sue me.

95
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,827
I don't want to do that.

96
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,373
Let me make you an offer.

97
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,253
I don't know how you twisted
my stepmom's arm to settle,

98
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,130
but it won't work on me.

99
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,885
The killer question.

100
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,058
The killer question on this year's CSAT…

101
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,020
I'll give it to you.

102
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,288
What the hell?

103
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,664
Damn it.

104
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,299
YOU KEPT A LEDGER?
HOW CONVENIENT!

105
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,800
COME TO THE ROOFTOP

106
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,731
This is 911. What's your emergency?

107
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,149
I want to report a crime.

108
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,859
I'm sorry!

109
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,653
I was wrong. Please forgive me!

110
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,529
I'll call back.

111
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,499
I need to talk to Je-i,

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,585
but I can't seem to reach her.

113
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,636
But you can. Right, A-ra?

114
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,830
We need to talk.

115
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,418
Did your dad bug this place, too?

116
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,961
Or is he somewhere watching?

117
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,923
I need to talk to you.

118
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,508
I don't need to hear it.

119
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,220
Your dad offered me the killer question.

120
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,771
I guess that wasn't part of your plan.

121
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,940
Don't tell me…

122
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,902
-Reject his offer.
-Why?

123
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,237
Why should I do that?

124
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,615
You need to give me a reason.

125
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,285
How can I understand if you won't talk?

126
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,876
Unless you tell me yourself,

127
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,211
I'll never know what you're planning!

128
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,943
You keep coming home late.

129
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,612
I was swimming.

130
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,282
Moving my body helps me focus,
just like you said.

131
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,785
Make sure to dry your hair properly.

132
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,745
You wouldn't want to catch a cold.

133
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,921
Are you really going to give Seul-gi
the killer question?

134
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,883
Are you worried?

135
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,678
You don't want us
both ranked first in the nation.

136
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,304
She looked quite desperate.

137
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,015
She'll be a good motivator for you.

138
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,350
A "motivator"?

139
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,353
You're just afraid
I'll expose your secret.

140
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,146
But isn't it a problem

141
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,359
if your little safety measure
is more of a liability than me?

142
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,362
Her only chance
to change her life is the CSAT.

143
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,283
What do you think matters more to her?
Her dead father or the killer question?

144
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,662
Seul-gi isn't as naive as you think.

145
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,040
Then you should raise the stakes,

146
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,667
so she can't break her promise.

147
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,130
How about making her
steal the question herself?

148
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,299
You can collect proof of it, too.

149
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,147
100 DAYS UNTIL THE CSAT

150
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:06,196
I need a token of your trust and sincerity
to prove we're on the same team.

His hobby is collecting art
on a public university professor's salary?

157
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,808
That's obviously fishy.

158
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,275
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello.

159
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,197

I can do this.

165
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,291
Please.

166
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,798
Hey, be quiet for a second.

167
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,592
What is that sound?

168
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,389
Were those moans?

169
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,308
Did a stray cat in heat sneak in here?

170
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,687
Unbelievable. Do they think
this is their bedroom?

171
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,647
They must be insane.

172
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,649

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,553
NEW POST ON ANONYMOUS MESSAGES
FOR DAEJUN-DONG RESIDENTS

183
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,599
WHO IS THE HOSTESS CLUB GODDESS
FROM CHAEHWA HIGH?

184
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,435
THAT'S WHERE THE TOP 10% GIRLS SERVE

185
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,831
2025 CSAT APPLICATION FORM

186
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,610
That little bitch.

187
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,328
What the hell?

188
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,579
Give it back!

189
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,040
What is it? Do you need more money?

190
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,374
Fine, I'll give you more.

191
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,710
Do you really want to do this?

192
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,922
Just go.

193
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,300
Look at you, acting all high and mighty.

194
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,178
But you accept
hostess club business cards.

195
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,554
What the fuck are you saying?

196
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,056
I left that place long ago.

197
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,316
I knew the moment I saw you grinning
over that 10% business card.

198
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,193
I'm not surprised.

199
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,195
That's all you saw growing up.

200
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,197
Fuck you, bitch.

201
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,907
It was you, wasn't it?

202
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,408
You uploaded that post.

203
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,205
I'm not like you.
I don't go around selling others' secrets.

204
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,456
Damn it.

205
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,044
-Let go.
-Hey!

206
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,047
-Stop!
-Let go!

207
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,676
Hey!

208
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,889
Stop trying to beat Je-i.

209
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,226
If you want to continue private tutoring,
keep your mouth shut.

210
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,811
Damn you.

211
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,438
What are you talking about?

212
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,252
HOW TO EDIT AND CAPTION VIDEOS

213
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,635
Did you catch a cold?

214
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,803
No, it's allergies.

215
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,811
You dropped something.

216
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,536
What are you doing here?

217
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,371
Do you have a dog?

218
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,248
Yes, so what?

219
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,876
Mom!

220
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,252
Get the dog.

221
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,306
Sometimes, I imagine Je-yun dying.

222
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,978
I'm afraid I'll be too sad
when Je-yun really dies,

223
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,689
so I imagine it in advance
to prepare myself.

224
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,159
I don't know anything else.

225
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,121
Je-i asked me to adopt Je-yun
in exchange for private tutoring.

226
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,124
Really, that's all I know.

227
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,683
Je-i!

228
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,925
