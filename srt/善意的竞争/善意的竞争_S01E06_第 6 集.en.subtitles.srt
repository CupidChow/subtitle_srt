Yu Je-i.

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,510
Answer me.

13
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,434
Stop it.

14
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:44,938
Stop what?

15
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,272
Why should I stop?

16
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,191
Your question is so lame

17
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,276
that I don't think it deserves an answer.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,611
Is that so?

19
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,572
The same goes for you, Yu Je-i.

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,951
You just told me

21
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,912
that you'd make sure to find out

22
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,789
who stole my essay.

23
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,085
If someone was curious
about my A-plus essay,

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,962
they could've read it alone.

25
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,631
Why would they share it with everyone

26
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,926
at a place like
Chaehwa Girls' High School?

27
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,678
Don't tell me…

28
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:24,060
Do you think I'm ashamed
of my unfortunate past?

29
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,688
You're wrong.

30
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,898
I'm not ashamed of myself at all.

31
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,777
You know nothing about me.

32
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,955
-Did you read her essay?
-Yes.

33
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,957
-She grew up in an orphanage.
-No wonder.

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,875
Did you read it?

35
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,918
Yes, I did.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,548
Can I borrow a pad?

37
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,051
You always ask out of nowhere.
It puts me in a tough spot.

38
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,428
Sorry.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,099
You should be more prepared
before your period starts.

40
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,187
Hey, Class President.

41
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,649
Did you really live at an orphanage
before transferring here?

42
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,861
Hey.

43
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,529
Can't you read Korean?

44
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,074
Why are you asking her
when it's all written in her essay?

45
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,706
Hey, Woo Seul-gi.

46
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,625
Get up.

47
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,627
There's a student assembly.

48
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,128
Oh, okay.

00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,353
CHAEHWA GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
84TH STUDENT COUNCIL INAUGURATION

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
Hello.

51
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,525
I'm Jung Yu-seon,
the 84th Student Council president

52
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,362
of Chaehwa Girls' High School.

53
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,447
At Chaehwa Girls' High School,

54
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,075
we practice honesty,
unity, and generosity…

55
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,535
If you have a question, just ask it.

56
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,830
I don't have one.

57
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,416
Then why do you keep looking at me?

58
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,878
Do you like me?

59
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,546
No way.

60
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,925
Well…

61
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,637
Your late father…

62
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,390
Was he Mr. Woo Do-hyeok?

63
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,063
So, your father passed away
at J Medical Center.

64
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,190
How do you know that?

65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,028
My mom is the attorney for that case.

66
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,366
Wait.

67
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:44,993
Didn't you know?

68
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,372
Your stepmom filed

69
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,125
a medical malpractice lawsuit
against Je-i's dad.

70
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,876
I had no idea.

71
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,547
No wonder.

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,425
If you'd known,
you wouldn't have been friends with Je-i.

73
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,473
With Je-i's dad's medical skills,

74
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,518
it won't be a problem
proving it wasn't medical malpractice.

75
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,021
Then what is?

76
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,733
If the media hears
about the medical dispute,

77
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,235
it'll be a big blow to J Medical Center.

78
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,656
So, the fact that there's even a lawsuit
is a problem for them.

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,244
Then, they must want to settle…

80
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,788
as soon as possible.

81
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,998
That's right.

82
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,710
They're probably working hard
to sway your stepmom,

83
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,128
but I doubt it'll be easy.

84
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,090
If that were the case,
there wouldn't be a lawsuit to begin with.

85
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,179
That means I'm another way
to achieve a settlement.

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,181
That's what I think.

87
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,725
Once you and Je-i got close,

88
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,811
she probably planned
to give you the settlement contract.

89
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,648
Appeal to your emotions
and get your signature.

90
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,983
It's a meticulous strategy.

91
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,737
If not for that,
why would she be nice to you?

92
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,783
So, in the end,

93
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,787
she would need to win me over.

94
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,914
-Nice to meet you. My name is--
-I know. It's Yu Je-i.

95
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,836
You fit right in between my arms.

96
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,089
Get up. Come with me.

97
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,218
Congratulations, Seul-gi.

98
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,511
Hey, Woo Seul-gi.

99
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,304
What?

100
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,515
I asked if you had painkillers.

101
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,350
Are you feeling sick?

102
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,102
It's PMS.

103
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,147
What?

104
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,610
It helps with the cramps
if you press this spot.

105
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,908
I don't have time for this.

106
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,702
-You don't have any painkillers?
-No.

107
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,832
I don't have money
to buy painkillers every month.

108
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,629
I'm off.

109
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,509
Also, if you have
any questions while studying,

110
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,261
ask me instead of Je-i.

111
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,683
Then, can I ask you something?

112
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,184
Right now?

113
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,894
What is it?

114
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,190
Why are you being nice to me?

115
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,403
Don't worry.

116
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,948
It's not because I like you
or want something from you.

117
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,451
Why, then?

118
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,414
It's because of my inferiority complex
toward Je-i.

119
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,332
Let's leave it at that.

120
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,919
I'm going.
You can take the 300 bus from here.

121
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,013
JE-I: WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU GHOSTING?
LET'S MEET NOW

122
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,264
HEY, WOO SEUL-GI! ANSWER ME

123
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,974
THINK YOU CAN STUDY
FOR MIDTERMS WITHOUT ME?

124
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,517
SURE YOU WON'T REGRET IT?

125
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,947
You'll feel a slight pinch.

126
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,453
-Do you know?
-Know what?

127
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,497
You're the only person

128
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,458
who stares straight
at the needle going into your body.

129
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,294
It makes me tense up.

130
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,131
I need to know when it'll hurt
so I can be ready.

131
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,175
Does being ready change anything?

132
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,885
The pain is the same, isn't it?

133
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,765
So, please close your eyes next time.

134
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,391
Little miss scaredy-cat.

135
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,062
I'll just take 200 ml today.

136
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,314
-Take more while you're at it.
-No, I can't.

137
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,734
I don't know if it's okay
to take all this blood from you

138
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,653
when you don't even sleep properly.

139
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,404
How do you withstand all of this?

140
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,448
I slept really well last night.

141
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,909
I'm running on stored-up sleep.

142
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,870

145
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,076
Talk to your stepmom when you get home.

146
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
Unless she kept it from you on purpose,

147
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,832
it's odd that you didn't know
about the lawsuit.

148

THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A SECRET

154
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:39,055
DO YOU KNOW WHY YOUR HUSBAND DIED?

155
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,443
I barely see you lately.

156
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,904
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,031
I wasn't looking for an apology.

158
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,951
Since we live together,
let me know if you'll be late.

159
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,204
Is that too much to ask?

160
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,626
What about you?

161
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,379
Although you and I aren't blood-related,
I'm my dad's daughter.

162
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,133
The lawsuit.

163
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,220
Why did you hide it from me?

164
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,596
Shall I take a guess?

165
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,933
Without me knowing, you wanted
to sue J Medical Center for a nice payout

166
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,227
and start a new life, right?

167
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,105
Were you hoping my dad would die?

168
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,524
Why did you even look for me?

169
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,109
If it weren't for you,

170
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,195
I could've comfortably stayed
at the orphanage until I got kicked out.

171
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,906
What do I do now?

172
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,536
Will you take responsibility for me?

173
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,885
From now on,

174
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,054
I'll let you know in advance.

175
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,433
Thank you for the meal.

176
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,601
Sure.

177
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,770
Okay.

178
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,656
I know it's shameless of me,

179
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,742
but I'd like to keep living here
just until the CSAT.

180
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,709
Please.

181
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,894
Some of these questions
will definitely be on the midterm.

182
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,395
So, what should you do?

183
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,855
-Memorize it.
-Memorize it.

184
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,898
How?

185
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,858
-Meticulously.
-Meticulously.

186
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,694
These are the past mock exams
from the last ten years.

187
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,447
If you study every single question,

188
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,116
not only will you ace school exams,
but the CSAT as well.

189
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,202
Now, start studying.

190
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,602
ENGLISH SECTION

191
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,393
8 DAYS UNTIL MIDTERMS

192
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,645
7 DAYS UNTIL MIDTERMS

193
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,153
I've been taking this medication,

194
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,113
but I ran out,
so I'm here for a prescription.

195
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,034
I understand taking medication
to get better grades,

196
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,828
but I can't prescribe them
without a proper evaluation.

197
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,580
An evaluation?

198
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,832
In order to confirm you have ADHD,

199
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,709
you need an IQ and attention test.

200
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,545
It costs 240,000 won,
and the results take two weeks.

201
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,630
Will you take them?

202
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,507
If your menstrual cramps are bad,

203
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,135
and you take birth control pills
before every exam,

204
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,678
why don't you opt for surgery?

205
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,598
-Surgery?
-Have you heard of an IUD?

206
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,392
We insert a contraceptive device
in your uterus

207
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,686
to regulate the hormone levels.

208
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,855
It thins the uterine lining

209
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,232
and stops your period from occurring.

210
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,151
Most girls come with their moms

211
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,987
to get it done before junior year.

212
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,823
My mom is too focused on her work
to know these things.

213
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,701
I'll do it immediately.

00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,461

The exam costs 300,000 won,

219
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,707
and results take at least one week.

220
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,500
You're a student, right?

221
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,794
You need to bring a guardian
to get a prescription.

222
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,048
We must examine you
before prescribing anything.

227
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,003
Hey, Su-jin. I was going to call you.

228
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,672
Seul-gi, can you lend me some money?

229
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,799
Money?

230
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,552
You know I don't have any.

231
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,471
Maybe you don't,
but I'm sure your dad does.

232
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,057
I need one million won.

233
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,183
Please?

234
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,653
SU-JIN

235
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,571
Blocked.

236
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,534
What should I search?

237
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,411
Consotine for sale.

238
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,662

248
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,897
"The code"?

249
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,737
I'll give you one, too.

250
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,325

I had a feeling it might be you.

264
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,635
It's really Woo Seul-gi.

265
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,306
So, this is your great study method?

266
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,141
I'm disappointed.

267
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,893
It's not like that--

268
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,104
I'm not supposed to meet customers.

269
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,983
Since we're both in a tough spot,
let's pretend we didn't see each other.

270
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,110
That will be best.

271
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,117
By the way, since it's peak season,

272
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,743
we're all out of the pills you ordered.

273
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,038
I gave you a much stronger
and better one instead.

274
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,374
Give it a try. You'll like it.

275
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,712
What is the name of the medication?

276
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,214
That's a trade secret.

277
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,426
It'll be better for you if you trust me.

278
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,430
That way, you can try this new pill.

279
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,116
No, thanks.

280
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,993
Return my money and take the pills.

281
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,077
Are you sure?

282
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,038
Can you study for midterms without them?

283
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,125
Everyone here takes pills
to pull all-nighters,

284
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,253
even when they're just looking
at cram school pointers.

285
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,664
How about this?

286
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:58,418
If you score higher than me
on this midterm,

287
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,214
I'll tell you how I got your information

288
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,507
and why I got it.

289
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,510
What do you say? Are you interested now?

290
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,099
That's right.

291
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,476
You'll need those pills to beat me.

292
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,895
And this, too.

BULL'S-EYE PREMIUM ACADEMY

294
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,121
Dear Seul-gi,
what would you do without me?

295
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,543
I told you.

296
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,257
You can't study for midterms without me.

297
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,179
I'm off.

298
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,140
See you tomorrow.

299
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,081
What brings you here?

300
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,499
You're still a student.

301
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,130
I guess someone recruited you.

302
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,631
Will you take it off?

303
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,098
Why are you so quick
to take off your clothes?

304
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,267
I meant your hat.

305
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,352
This is a job interview,
so I need to see your face.

306
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,859
You're gorgeous.

307
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,736
Why don't you try acting?

308
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,363
I don't want to be an actress.
I want to go to college.

309
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,824
I'm here to make money for the tuition.

310
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,243
Really? I don't buy that.

311
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,871
Your bag is a fake.

312
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,748
I usually carry real ones,

313
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,250
but I needed money,
so I sold them all except this one.

314
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,461
I'm telling you, I never carry fakes!

315
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,464
Gosh, okay.
I can tell you like luxury brands.

316
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,549
You're even settling for a fake.

317
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,426
This place is full of girls like you.

318
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,637
Once you enter, there's no turning back.

319
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,641
I said I'm different.
I'm leaving once I earn my tuition.

320
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,142
You sold everything you own.

321
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,604
I get that all you have left to sell
is your body.

322
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,939
Just think it over.

323
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,609
Although, we'd be happy to have you.

Excuse me, miss.

326
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,399
Have you seen this woman?

327
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:08,984
No, I haven't.

328
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,611
Excuse me, miss.

329
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,990
Have you seen this person?

330
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,577
Why do you ask?

331
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,414
Did she steal someone's money?

332
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,082
That's none of your business.

333
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:27,836
Wait.

334
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,302
