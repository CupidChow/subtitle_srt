1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,775
Je-i.

4
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,205
I was wrong.

5
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,790
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,083
Was this also my dad's order?

7
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,628
No.

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,382
If you tell me the truth,
I'll give you all the pills.

9
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:51,926
Really?

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,094
Yes.

11
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,805
I failed to steal the phone,

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,266
so your dad doesn't trust me.

13
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,352
Is Ye-ri the one
who stole Mr. Woo's phone?

14
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,022
I did, but then I lost it.

15
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,315
Someone took it from me.

16
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,734
Haven't you been listening, Choi Gyung?

17
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,820
I remembered how Beom-su

18
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,907
was rambling about
seeing Je-na at the festival.

19
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,367
When I asked her, she turned pale.

20
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,412
I figured your dad
must have talked to Beom-su as well.

21
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,539
So, I knew you hadn't found Je-na yet.

22
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,002
That's why I thought
you would definitely take the bait.

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,671
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,298
Fuck, you're greedy for money.

25
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,549
You're right.

26
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,801
I'm crazy about money.

27
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,386
You guys only treat me with decency

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,555
because I own luxury brands.

29
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,017
I know that's why you pretend
to be my friends!

30
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,770
Look at her exploding with insecurity.

31
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,731
Did you really do this
just for luxury brands?

32
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
No.

33
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,197
My family went bankrupt.

34
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,076
Now you're using
your parents as an excuse?

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,453
I'm serious. I haven't gotten
an allowance in a while.

36
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,373
My apartment got seized, so I can't go in.

37
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,833
I sold my harp just to get by.

38
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,960
I have nothing now!

39
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,879
-As if we'd believe--
-Where have you been sleeping?

40
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,506
A public bathhouse.

41
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,967
You sleep at a public bathhouse?

42
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,677
Bullshit. Have you even been to one?

43
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,639
Is that enough proof?

44
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,308
I bet you're happy
and think I deserve this.

45
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,439
Hey, I was just…

46
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,027
You just look too pretty for someone
who slept at a bathhouse.

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,161
Be careful, especially late at night.

48
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,872
Have you eaten?

49
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,751
I stole your dad's phone,
but you're worried about me?

50
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,088
You're so annoying.

51
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,800
Thank you for telling the truth.

52
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,225
But why would Je-i's dad
need my dad's phone?

53
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,686
What could be on it?

54
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,855
I don't know that, either.

55
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,954
So, you're all looking for her sister?

56
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,002
How would this old guy know Je-na?

57
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,962
He was at the festival, too.

58
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,963
What?

59
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,716
You and your sister look quite alike.

60
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,928
Wait.

61
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,306
If you like the patch, tell her about it.

62
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,767
No wonder your voice sounded familiar.

63
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,269
You gave me the fentaryn patch, right?

64
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,604
Hey, Woo Seul-gi.

65
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,064
Explain this.

66
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,983
Guys, don't drink this.

67
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,277
This creep definitely spiked them.

68
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,953
Fine.

69
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,038
Figure it out yourselves, druggies.

70
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,915
I'll be off.

71
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,042
I thought she was a boy at first.

72
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,465
It was weirder that she was a girl.

73
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,107
People from Seoul are so damn…

74
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,573
That brat, Su-jin,
didn't just take the drugs.

75
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,658
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD, LEE MIN-JU

76
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,327
She also took all the fake IDs
we use for prescriptions.

77
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,037
That fucking bitch.

78
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,498
I can't send the kids
for pick-up without them.

79
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,375
So?

80
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,210
Are you still here?

81
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,924
So, you're saying
my sister had one of your fake IDs?

82
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,928
This Su-jin girl
must've sold them to Je-na.

83
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,888
What kind of drugs does she take?

84
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,937
She has narcolepsy,
so she takes stimulants like Modafenol.

85
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,315
Is that all? Does she have an addiction?

86
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,358
Why do you ask?

87
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,236
Wait.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,863
Can we talk privately?

89
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,918
You saw Je-i's sister that day

90
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,629
at Gangnam Station, right?

91
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,259
We have to find her first
in order to catch Su-jin.

92
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,844
Answer me first.

93
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,972
The high school girl
with a monopoly on Gangnam's drug trade…

94
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,308
That's her, right?

95
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,853
With her gone, we can sell drugs together,

96
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,064
and you'll be top of your class.

97
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,608
Do you want me to make her disappear?

98
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,488
I'm just kidding.

99
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,323
Why the serious face?

100
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,785
Her sister got taken by an ambulance.

101
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,331
It looked a lot like a kidnapping.

102
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,211
Do you know where the ambulance went?

103
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,300
Hello?

104
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,095
What?

105
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,971
You found Yu Je-na?

108
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,211
Okay, I understand.

109
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,631
We found a handwritten will
in the hospital room, after all.

110
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,842

She fell off a cliff.

114
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,928

as our grades.

Don't step on the line.

00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,346
Hey, do it properly.

00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,722
Don't mess around.

131
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,474

-Could it be--
-Seul-gi.

135
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,442
Is it true
that Je-i's sister committed suicide?

136
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,319
No.

137
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,446
I heard she had a brain tumor.

138
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,949
Then how could she sell drugs
at Gangnam Station?

139
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:40,079
Actually, I heard
someone pushed her off a mountain cliff.

140
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,207
What? Are you saying she was murdered?

141
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,125
By whom?

142
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,334
I heard

143
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,004
it was Je-i.

144
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,222
-Hey!
-What the fuck are you doing?

145
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,932
-Are you crazy?
-She's lost her mind!

146
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,475
-What's your problem?
-Stop!

147
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,435
Hey, Woo Seul-gi.

148
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,667
Why don't you aim higher

149
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,713
and apply to Hankuk Medical School?

150
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,091
Your dream career
until junior year was a doctor.

151
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,427
Was it?

152
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,349
Although Je-i and Seul-gi
are ranked first,

153
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,601
it's possible they were
involved in a crime.

154
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,522
We can't waste our single letter
of recommendation from the principal

00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,527
I think you have a good chance at it.

157
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,196
Sure, thank you.

158
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,907
You'll need to prepare a lot,
so get started.

159
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,325
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,911
Just keep on the same path.

161
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,455

Okay.

171

00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,513

00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,225
that you have my dad's phone.

183
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,062
You saw what was on it, right?

184
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,399
How did you guess the PIN?

185
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,401
I couldn't figure it out
for the life of me.

186
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,779
One, zero, zero, seven, one, three.

187
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,325
The day you went missing.

188
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,161
July 13th, 2010.

189
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,880
Please give it back now.

190
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,465
I lost it.

191
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,760
I thought my sister had taken it.

192
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,542
Do you know the story of Cain and Abel?

193
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,796
You know, the Bible story about the man…

194
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,009
who killed his young brother
out of jealousy.

195
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,722
I always thought

196
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,101
that my sister might kill me.

197
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,106
But…

198
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,360
in my dreams,

199
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,530
I smashed my sister's skull to bits
and killed her.

200
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,996
While staring at her dead body,

201
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,333
I felt a strange sense of peace.

202
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,174
I sincerely hoped…

203
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,638
the police would catch my sister.

204
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,393
I believed that was the only way
everyone would survive.

205
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,531
I know.

206
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,408
Je-i.

207
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,411
It wasn't

208
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,831
your fault.

209
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,630
I didn't think…

210
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,426
there was a chance

211
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,804
she could die.

212
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,933
She's a coward, you know.

213
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,270
She'd never kill herself.

214
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,066
I didn't know my dad would kidnap her.

215
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,527
I swear.

216
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,264
So, you masturbated at school?

217
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,516
-Ye-ri--
-So, what?

218
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,435
I do it, too.

219
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,690
But it can look suspicious
since it was the night before midterms.

220
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,066
Right?

221
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,951
DELETE

222
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,831
Besides,

223
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,251
I'm more shocked that you knew
of Je-na and Mr. Woo's relationship

224
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,795
and kept it a secret all this time.

225
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,804
That brat, Su-jin,
didn't just take the drugs.

226
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,141
She also took all the fake IDs
we use for prescriptions.

227
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,728
This Su-jin girl
must've sold them to Je-na.

228
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,480
The number you have dialed
is out of service.

229
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,107
Please check the number and try again.

230
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,998
Hey, stop crying and get out.

231
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,583
I have to clean here.

232
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,684
Cover it with a tattoo.

233
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,229
That's my plan.

234
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,273
Choi Su-jin?

235
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,234
It can't be her.

236
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,902
There's no way.

237
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,919

DND DRUG ADDICTION REHABILITATION CENTER

239
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,615
Miss, are you okay?

240
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,154
Su-jin?

241
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,794
She had a burn scar on her foot, right?

242
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,380
I remember her

243
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,468
because she said
that scar was what kept her going.

244
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,847
She said that scar

245
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,142
meant her parents
would come looking for her eventually.

246
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,394
That's why she was trying to quit drugs.

247
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,232
Where is she now?

248
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,192
She left.

249
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,694
Did she find her family?

250
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,072
Of course not.

251
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,408
Her condition improved,

252
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,662
so she went back
to the student hostel she was living in.

253
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,914
By any chance,

254
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,543
do you know the address?

255
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,517
What exactly did Je-na hide here?

256
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,148
Beom-su said it was somewhere around here.

257
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,275
Why haven't you told any of us?

258
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,653
I didn't know Je-na would die.

259
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,491
Or, maybe you planned
to sell out to Je-i's dad.

260
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,665
Oh, shit!

MAGNOLIA HOTEL

264
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,811
Excuse me.

265
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,522
-I'm looking for the woman in room 208.
-She's dead.

266
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,317
What?

267
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,401
I said she's dead.

268
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,197
Since when?

269
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,199
It's been about a month.

270
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,494
She was behind on rent,
and I didn't see her around,

271
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,954
so I went in and found her.

272
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,831
This is an unlucky nuisance for us, too.

273
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,125
She had no family or friends,

274
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,336
so I had to go
to the police station myself.

275
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,047
At least I got back
the rent money she owed.

276
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,382
What a relief.

277
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,636
Wait.

278
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,805
Someone paid the rent? Who?

279
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,765
He looked like a thug,

280
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,559
but he said he was her brother.

281
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,938
He even visited local stores
to settle all of her unpaid tabs.

282
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,448
Je-na must have really lost her mind.

283
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,873
Isn't this the killer math problem
on last year's CSAT?
