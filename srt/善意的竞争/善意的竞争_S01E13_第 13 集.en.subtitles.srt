-Good luck!

Good luck!

00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,602
-Good luck.
-Do your best.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,521
-You've got this.
-Good luck.

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,857
-Good luck!
-I wish you luck.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,024
-Good luck.
-Je-na.

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,653
Hey, Ye-ri.

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,989
You know you're our hope, don't you?

11
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,449
You'll ace the CSAT.

12
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,867
We're rooting for you. Good luck.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,160
Oh, thanks.

14
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,495
DON'T THINK OF RETAKING THE CSAT!

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,621
Hey.

16
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:41,958
Dear Je-i.

17
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,878
You've always scared me.

18
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,629
-Good luck, Je-na.
-Good luck.

22
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,666
You looked at me mockingly
as if you knew everything.

23
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,503
I thought I'd lose my mind.

24
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,424
This is all your fault, Yu Je-i.

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,384
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT, YU JE-I

26
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,059
It sucks not to be
as good as your younger sibling.

27
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,728
Nobody would understand.

28
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,980
I simply wanted to beat you

29
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,441
and make Dad love me again.

30
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,216
When Dad found out about me and Mr. Woo,

31
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,469
he praised me.

32
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,138
Very warmly, at that.

33
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,225
It was the kind of compliment
I'd never had before.

34
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,603
I heard you lost a daughter
thirteen years ago.

35
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,202
-Let's stop this.
-Why?

36
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,871
What got into you now?

37
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,582
We agreed to keep looking
for one more year.

38
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,916
Why do you do this?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,835
Why do you want to find my daughter?

40
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,255
If we find her, you might agree
to have a child with me, too.

41
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,341
We won't have a child
whether we find Seul-gi or not.

42
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,427
You should give up.

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,244
"Woo Seul-gi"?

44
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,376
MISSING CHILD
NAME: WOO SEUL-GI

45
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,892
DEAR JE-I
YOU'VE ALWAYS SCARED ME…

46
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,771
No, thank you.

47
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,773
I'm not asking for a favor for free.

48
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll compensate for it.

49
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,611
I don't need it.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

50
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,820
I'll find your daughter.

51
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,785
And then, father to father,

52
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,995
we can both do our very best.

53
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,927
Je-na knew Mr. Woo had a missing daughter
and used it to her advantage?

54
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,184
SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2023
DEAR JE-I…

55
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,396
I swear I did not tell anyone.

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,315
Hello?

57
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,484
IS IT TRUE CHAEHWA HIGH'S KIM SEON-YEONG
IS A QUESTION-SETTER FOR THIS YEAR?

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,152
Hello?

59
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,706
Mr. Woo.

60
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:57,588
Ms. Kim was fired as a CSAT
question-setter for breach of secrecy.

61
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,260
Our omniscient and omnipotent father.

62
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,579
I found your daughter.

after 13 years, don't you think?

The plan was simple.

76
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,250
He was to swallow a capsule
with the killer math problem

77
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,793
and sneak out of confinement.

00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,487
Dear Heavenly Father,
ruler of the living and the dead,

81
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,990
we gathered here today to mourn
the life and death of Yu Je-na,

82
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,285
who suffered for a long time
with a brain tumor

83
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,372
before leaving this world to be with you.

84
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,126
We were forged from dust
and will return to dust.

85
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,922
We believe that you gave us life
and that you take it from us…

86
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,298
The whole family's here.

87
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,300
She'll be in the coffin soon.

88
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,098
Our beloved sister Yu Je-na's body
may have disappeared from our sight,

89
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,936
but on the glorious day
you promised us that would come,

90
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,606
we know we will meet again
in a different body

91
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,359
that has overcome death.

92
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,946
Today, we part for a brief while.

93
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,073
It is a short farewell…

94
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,457
Yu Je-i.

95
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,335
You don't think so, either.

96
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,046
-What do you mean?
-This body.

97
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,339
It's not Je-na's.

98
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,266
Look. There's a burn mark.

99
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,311
Did your sister have a scar like this?

100
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,938
Your father

101
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,233
has quite an interesting hobby.

102
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,944
He collects unidentified corpses

103
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,487
and practices his skills on them.

104
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,825
She's from my orphanage.

105
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,369
Choi Su-jin.

106
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,915
No one claimed her body after she died,

107
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,376
so the morgue fees kept piling up.

108
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,881
The local government sends such corpses
to your dad's hospital.

109
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,970
Also, Choi Su-jin
stayed right next door to your sister.

110
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,973
Is that a coincidence?

111
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,934
I get it now.

112
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,188
He's a doctor, and he's family.

113
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,691
There would've been no hitch
pronouncing her dead or identifying her.

114
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,568
Not to mention a letter, too.

115
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,612
It's just perfect.

116
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,371
What are you doing?

117
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,333
Will you turn her into your sister?

118
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,542
Yes.

119
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,753
Then Je-na will no longer exist.

120
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,589
If Dad's plan is to make it
look like she's dead,

121
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,760
won't it be in our favor
to let him to commit more crimes?

122
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,931
If we put a stop to Je-na's funeral,

123
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,683
my dad will just come up with a new plan.

124
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,728
Because he never gives up.

125
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:33,984
For now, Dad can't know
that we know about this.

126
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,613
Let's get out of here.

127
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,282
Go on your own.

128
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,618
I can't leave like this.

129
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,580
You see,

130
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,458
I read your sister's journal.

131
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,170
How my dad ended up dead.

132
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,465
It was all there.

133
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,718
I have to find evidence.

134
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,736
You'll get caught
before you find anything.

135
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,238
Come with me.

136
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,706
I'll buy you some time. Hurry.

137
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,351
Miss Yu?

138
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,901
Mom doesn't want footage of the VIP guests

139
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,820
remaining on the server
when it's a sad event we'd rather forget.

140
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,864
She told me to turn off
the security cameras

141
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,990
until the coffin gets taken away.

142
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,326
I must confirm with the director--

143
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,786
It's my mom's request, not the director's.

144
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,163
That's why she sent me.

145
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,800
Where were you during the service?

146
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,262
Then where the hell were you
while Je-na got this bad?

147
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,142
Smile.

148
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,602
It's what you're good at.

149
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,562
Oh, no.

150
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,272
Should you rather cry today?

151
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,527
You're a doctor
but couldn't even treat your child?

152
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,404
Who would want to be your patient now?

153
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,822
That's enough.

154
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,701
It's better for the parents
if a weak kid gets out of the way sooner.

155
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,496
You have grown up, Je-i.

156
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,956
I hear you excel in school.

157
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,291
Too bad it happened in your senior year.

158
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,461
You should be using
every available moment to study.

159
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,924
That only applies to students
who cram before exams.

160
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,844
A short break from studying
won't hurt someone like me, Uncle.

161
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,055
My gosh.

162
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,349
You have a child just like yourself.

163
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,393
Thanks for the compliment.

164
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,674
WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2023
DEAR JE-I…

165
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:25,966
Dear Je-i.

166
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,427
Dad sees everything.

167
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,180
Who is naughty…

168
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,017
and who is nice.

169
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,668
What?

170
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,045
Are you stuck?

171
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,130
Shall I do it for you?

172
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,840
Did you come here to show off?

173
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,676
You have no time to sit and stare.

174
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,928
I don't need your help. Get out.

175
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,845
Get out!

176
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,223
Get out!

177
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,849
Get out!

178
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,309
Get out of here!

179
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,770
Get lost!

180
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,126
You should never cry.

181
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,712
Dad doesn't give presents

182
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,256
to a child who cries.

183
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,728
This is a reference to a Christmas carol.

184
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,104
What's the "present"?

185
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,815
Was there something that Je-na wanted?

186
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,123
I'm not sure.

187
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,332
But Je-na was obsessed

188
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,794
with birthdays, Christmas,
and anniversaries, just like Dad.

189
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,361
The day before last year's CSAT,
November 15th.

190
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,568
No, Seul-gi.

191
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,295
Ma'am.

192
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,176
Yu Je-na.

193
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,808
It's women's intuition.

194
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,144
I wanted to ignore it.

195
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,316
THE KEY CHAIN IS MY GUARDIAN, MR. WOO.
FROM JE-NA

196
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,401
But I couldn't.

197
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,155
That girl

198
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,117
kept hovering around us.

199
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,037
I'LL BRING YOUR HUSBAND'S PHONE

200
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,708
All the suspicious incidents
that happened after Do-hyeok died…

201
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,255
At first,

202
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,550
I thought it was the girl's doing.

203
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,554
YU JE-NA IS DEAD

204
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,223
Could it be that Je-na

205
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,810
was trying to tell us something?

206
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,158
Make way, please.

207
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,951
J MEDICAL CENTER
FUNERAL HALL

208
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,042
I am fully aware that they framed you

209
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,669
for stealing drugs to force me to settle.

210
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,716
So, did you settle with them?

211
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,760
No.

212
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,432
When I said I would not,

213
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,810
they asked if it was
because I was a stepmom.

214
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,522
Do you agree with that?

215
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,068
No, you did the right thing.

216
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,321
Where are you going?

217
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,365
Hold onto this, please.

218
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,118
And keep the lawyer here.

219
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,288
-Seul--
-Does she mean me?

220
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,382
Shit, you startled me.

221
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,176
What do you want?

222
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,928
Don't you know everything?

223
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,179
About what?

224
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,514
Don't lie to me.

225
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,559
I know you paid off
Su-jin's rent and unpaid tabs.

226
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,437
What about it?

227
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,525
Aren't you here
because it's Su-jin's funeral?

228
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,780
If no one had done anything,

229
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,616
she would have been kept
in a freezer all alone, unable to rot.

230
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,952
It's nice that she got a send-off
she didn't deserve.

231
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,955
Take it positively.

232
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,917
Do you really think so?

233
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,419
If you're human,

234
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,006
shouldn't you feel some guilt
that she ended up like this?

235
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,845
But then,

236
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,306
if you were human, you wouldn't have
gotten us hooked on meds.

237
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,060
Hey, get out.

238
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,689
You're not doing this
just for Su-jin, either.

239
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,082
This X-ray can't be used as evidence.

240
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,043
Why not? Why is that?

241
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,463
Even if this is
a CSAT math problem, as you claim,

242
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,259
being cut open to remove it
won't simply kill you.

243
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,470
Of course, not informing the family
of the patient's exact condition

244
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,389
can be considered malpractice.

245
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,517
But it's not easy to prove causality
with the cause of death.

246
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,812
And to go further
and say he intended to kill?

247
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,772
That's far-fetched.

248
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,192
He had hundreds of these records.

249
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,276
He killed…

250
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,782
He killed people
while listening to the music.

251
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,118
He could've listened to it
while saving people.

252
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,830
Did you listen to this record?

253
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,290
Yes.

254
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,250
It was a Lucid Fall song.

255
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,668
Je-na was a fan.

256
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,837
That's insane.

257
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,339
It's as she wrote in her journal.

258
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,926
Je-na was called to the operating room.

259
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,096
Since we don't have the security footage
from the operating room,

260
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,390
we need Je-na to take the witness stand.

261
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,808
If we can't do that,

262
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,520
we need something to prove
this is her handwriting.

263
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,690
But now, our only witness isn't with us.

264
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,411
What are these?

265
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,914
I received these after my husband died.

266
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,290
The person who sent them

267
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,793
knew about their relationship
from the start.

268
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,921
Could this person be another witness?

269
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,341
It could be a third person
that was in the OR,

270
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,759
or a CSAT question-setter.

271
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,678
It could be someone at their school.

272
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,767
If they knew something crucial,
wouldn't they have written it down?

273
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,396
There must be a reason
these were sent anonymously.

274
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,314
But even if you find out the sender,

275
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,234
it's never easy to persuade them
to take the stand.

276
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,280
When is the next hearing?

277
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,864
Why do you ask?

278
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,077
I understand you want to have hope,
but as I said before,

279
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,788
it's impossible to prove murder
with this evidence.

280
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,375
Unless you bring someone back
from the dead.

281
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,528
Quit playing detective.

282
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,238
Focus on studying for the CSAT.

283
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,745
If I were a lawyer,

284
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,123
I'd have so many questions for me,
a very important witness.

285
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,294
I guess you don't.

286
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,715
But you've never cared
about such low-value cases.

287
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,467
You pretend to care about your client

288
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,302
-and act like a great lawyer--
-Choi Gyung.

289
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,220
That's how you act around me.

290
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,765
You pretend to be a good mom
and a parent with a conscience.

291
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,807
You're a hypocrite.

292
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:27,812
Aren't you curious how I found out
about Mr. Woo and Je-na's relationship?

293
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,607
No.

294
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,901
I'm not curious at all.

295
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,658
You wouldn't know,
but I love to masturbate.

296
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,994
I went to school that day to masturbate.

297
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,289
Masturbating in the classroom
the day before an exam relieves stress.

298
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,667
And I happened to see Je-na with Mr. Woo.

299
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,795
I wanted to tell people,

300
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,090
but they would ask me back
why I was at school at that time.

301
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,676
I didn't think I could explain,
so I couldn't tell anyone.

302
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,723
I wished hell upon Je-i.

303
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,811
If only she were to disappear,
I would be ranked first.

304
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,107
I was so annoyed
that I was always in her shadow.

305
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,452
When I saw Je-na at the school festival…

306
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,997
I talked to her.

307
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,332
"I know everything.

308
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,627
If you don't tell the truth,
I will expose you."

309
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,298
But now, she's dead.

310
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,010
I'm scared to death
because I think it's my fault,

311
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,055
but my own mom just bullies me
and tells me to study.

312
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,727
You had nothing to do
with Yu Je-na's death.

313
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,896
The same goes for Mr. Woo's death.

314
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,774
You will never take
the witness stand in court.

315
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,446
So, don't ever repeat what you just said.

316
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,906
Do you understand, Gyung?

317
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,536
That's my advice as your mom and a lawyer.

318
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,093
BUSINESS CLUB

319
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,473
Hello, ma'am.

320
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,111
Can you get me Zolpidin?

321
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,321
Sleeping pills?

322
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,406
I'll see what I can do.

323
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,033
Don't sell to anyone else.

324
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,451
Supply me with everything.

325
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,702
I'll pay you well.

326
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,912
Okay.

327
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,748
Get me some cigarettes.
You can keep the change.

328
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,208
Thank you.

329
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,921
Hello.

330
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,643
Why? What is it?

331
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:15,104
You and Seul-gi.
You're birds of a feather.

332
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,606
Why would you compare me to her?

333
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,066
I'm way prettier.

334
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,907
I can't stop thinking
I'm losing out on this deal.

335
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,827
You kept all the Consotine from the club.

336
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,622
And you didn't tell me
you saw Je-na at Gangnam Station.

337
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,250
What business partners
have so little trust in each other?

338
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,460
I should do this alone.

339
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,547
I'm more persuasive as a dealer
than a young girl.

340
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,972
Can you also get me stuff like Zolpidin?

341
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,641
If we take over J Medical Center,
we can get more than Zolpidin.

342
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,560
Sit tight and wait.

343
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,981
By the way, what does
a rich, smart kid like Je-i

344
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,732
get from selling pills to kids?

345
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,734
Don't try to understand.

346
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,820
They're wired differently than us.

347
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,906
Why are you dragging me down
to your level by saying "us"?

348
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,992
Ma'am, how much do we owe you?

349
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,286
Can I have some blood sausage?

350
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,996
It'll be 5,000 won altogether.

351
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,129
Thank you.

352
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,258
Anyway, look out.

353
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,176
That man is scarier than you think.

354
