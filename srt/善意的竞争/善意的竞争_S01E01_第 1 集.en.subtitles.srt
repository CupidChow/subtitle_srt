4
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,401
-I was a child…
-Let's go.

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,154
…with zero presence.

6
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,740
I must've known that even as a kid.

7
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,033
When we went on a picnic,

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,870
I must've insisted on wearing
a princess dress instead of my uniform.

9
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,422
I think we went to the beach.

10
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,924
Was it by the East Sea? The West Sea?

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,137
No? Was it the South Sea?

12
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,933
I don't remember where, actually.

13
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,691
All I do remember is that, at one moment,
I was left alone with everyone gone.

14
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,361
I wonder sometimes, even now.

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,074
If I'd listened to Mom
and worn my uniform,

16
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,785
would I not have gone missing?

17
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,457
SUNSHINE NURSERY

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,892
Even at the orphanage, my lack of presence
was pretty much the same.

19
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,940
No one looked out for me,
so I often missed meals.

20
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,614
On days I went hungry,

21
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,700
I'd go outside at night
to drink tap water.

22
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,831
What I found odd was

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,625
however much I drank, I never felt full.

24
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,338
It felt like the water I drank
was leaking.

25
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,423
SUNSHINE NURSERY

26
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,759
We had an unusual school commute system.

27
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,054
We shared a van
and got dropped off one by one.

28
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,099
If the van didn't have the orphanage logo,

29
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,519
I'd have lied and said I was coming from
a dorm where I was training to be an idol.

30
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,521
SEUL-GI STINKS, ORPHAN GIRL

31
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,523
It wouldn't have worked, of course.

32
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,005
I'd been invisible all my life,
and to think I got noticed for this…

33
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,257
It was the worst.

34
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,928
Do you know something?

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,347
People like us can't get a reference,

36
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,224
so it's hard to get
even ordinary part-time jobs.

37
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,563
The so-called senior from the orphanage
got us a job like he was doing us a favor,

38
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,856
but it was buying medications.

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,901
Using fake IDs, of all things.

46
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,568
Do you do well in school?

47
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,573
Where do you rank in your class?

48
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,327
I'm at around 15th.

49
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,830
That's not bad.

50
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,125
There are about 30 kids in a class now,
so it's not exactly good.

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,544
What do you want to be when you grow up?

52
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,630
I don't know. I never thought about it.

53
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,008
People should have dreams.

54
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,638
Was your dream to prey upon poor kids
and sell medication?

55
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,727
Take it.

56
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,562
Gangnam kids would do anything
to get them.

57
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,573
Study hard
if you don't want to end up like me.

58
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,331
If that had come from a decent adult
who studied hard and had a decent job,

59
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,207
I probably wouldn't have listened.

60
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,794
Was it because it came
from a good-for-nothing bully?

61
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,380
It was strangely persuasive.

62
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,092
So, for the first time in my life,
I did something called "studying."

63
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,261
Would you believe it?

64
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,141
I used to be 15th in my class.

65
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,309
RANKED 15 OUT OF 264

66
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,603
I went to being 15th in my year.

67
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,870
The number on my report card
seemed to have great power.

68
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,790
People started treating me differently.

69
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,877
Once I started feeling full
even without eating,

70
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:19,962
I yearned for more.

71
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,591
I wanted to rank first in my year.

72
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,853
2023 GYEONGSANGBUK-DO MATH COMPETITION,
GOLD PRIZE WOO SEUL-GI

73
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,738
Why won't you talk, you fucking bitch?

74
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,741
-It wasn't just the adults that changed.
-Why are you about to cry?

75
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,075
Once my grades shot up,

76
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,329
even the punks
who just couldn't stop bullying me

77
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,039
didn't touch me any longer.

78
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,167
Do as you're told and hand it over.

79
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,544
-Come on.
-Whatever happened,

80
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,588
I had to go on being number one.

81
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,759
The thought of going back?

82
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,386
I hated that more than death itself.

83
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,022
"Often found around us…"

84
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,565
"Used in…"

85
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,407
Hey, is this it?

86
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,033
What?

87
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,370
Forget it. Let's go.

88
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,251
Oh, by the way, this is my last day.

89
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,962
I'm moving to Seoul.

90
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,257
To Seoul? Where in Seoul?

91
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:53,968
Gangnam?

92
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,429
Were you adopted by some rich family?

93
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,515
I found my dad.

94
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,365
Students took the 2024
College Scholastic Ability Test today,

95
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,327
and it is said to be
the hardest in recent history.

96
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,579
The head of the committee

97
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,707
that set the questions said
the difficulty was similar to last year,

98
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,501
but the students felt differently.

99
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,339
The "killer" math problems
were much harder than expected,

100
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,050
and whether the top scorers
get into medical school…

101
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,427
Seul-gi, you got a call from Seoul.

102
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,595
The scores of electives…

103
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,638
Okay.

104
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,765
…could also affect university placement.

105
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,392
As some electives were more difficult
than others,

106
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,313
the Korea Institute for Curriculum
and Evaluation will take public appeals

107
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,149
before sending out the report cards
next month on the eighth.

108
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,068
I have breaking news.

109
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,739
One member of the question-setting
committee for the 2024 CSAT has died.

110
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,865
Kim Jae-uk has the story…

111
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,377
4 MONTHS LATER

112
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,053
Thank you.

113
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,187
Call me before your afternoon lesson.

114
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll come get you.

115
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,817
I'll see what happens.

116
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,158
Hey, Choi Gyung.

117
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,537
-Wait up.
-Who was that guy?

118
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
Oh, my sweet little Gyung.

119
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,792
You always pretend not to care about me.
When did you see him?

120
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,378
We met at a recital last week.

121
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,130
You'll break up soon, then.

122
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,381
Yes. I just dumped him.

123
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,425
But he didn't seem to know that.

124
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,094
The poor creature. Blessings upon him.

125
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,139
Can I ask you something?

126
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,641
Why do you walk so fast?

127
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,143
We're seniors now.

128
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,021
It's quicker to walk
than to drive in traffic.

129
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,441
And I was right.

130
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,487
At this speed, I can get from my place
to my desk in class in 20 minutes.

131
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,949
Hey, Choi Gyun. I asked you to wait up.

132
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,891
Hello.

133
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,353
-Who are you?
-Oh, I'm transferring today.

134
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,813
Where do you fall on this list?

135
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,774
RANK OF KOREAN UNIVERSITIES

136
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,026
Your parents are transferring
a senior kid,

137
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,528
and they didn't come with you?

138
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,867
Go to Class Two.

139
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,911
-Oh, and…
-Yes?

140
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,498
Starting tomorrow,
can you get your school uniform sorted?

141
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,793
Yes.

142
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,675
Excuse me, where are
the senior year classrooms?

143
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,196
As the parched land

144
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,367
Is blessed with rain

145
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,330
Those who thirst for knowledge

146
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,001
Come over

147
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,213
Here we are…

148
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,256
Little girl.

149
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,675
Buy a flower.

150
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,760
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,852
Please buy a flower.

152
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,733
Listen up.

153
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,943
The orientation will begin soon.

154
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,196
Come on. Get the peddlers out of here.

155
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,865
Yes, ma'am. Lady.

156
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,326
You can't sell flowers here.

157
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
-You need to leave.
-I won't leave.

158
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,495
I can't leave.

159
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,414
I won't go until I sell everything.

160
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,790
You need to get up.

161
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,126
-You can't do this here.
-I'm not going anywhere.

162
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,252
-I won't--
-I'll buy them.

163
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,348
Granny.

164
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,309
I'll buy all the flowers.
How much are they?

165
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,770
It's 10,000 won per flower, so…

166
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,897
-Here you go.
-What?

167
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,234
Come on, now.

168
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,402
Let's get you going.

169
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,612
-Thank you.
-Come along.

170
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,697
Come with me now. Let's go.

171
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,905
Before we carry on
with the entrance ceremony,

172
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,199
we will have a moment of silence.

173
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,161
Mr. Woo Do-hyeok,

174
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,956
who taught us here at Chaehwa
over the past four years,

175
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,211
has recently and unfortunately
passed away.

176
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,842
We'll remember him for a long time
as a great teacher

177
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,637
and an upright educator.

178
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,850
The family of the deceased stated

179
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,520
Mr. Woo wouldn't have wanted
to interrupt his students' studies,

180
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,273
so we'll just hold
a short moment of silence.

181
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,025
Everyone,

182
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,610
bow in silence.

183
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,384
Get out if you don't go here.

184
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,768
Let's begin.

185
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,773
MEDICAL SUPPLY TRANSPORT

186
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,255
Next, we'll hand out
the scholarship certificates.

187
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,798
Han Jeong-won.

188
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,300
Where were you all this while?

189
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,219
…with good grades, as a prime example…

190
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,054
Take an empty seat.

191
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,975
March 4th, 2024,
President of the PTA, Yu Tae-jun.

192
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,560
Congratulations.

193
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,023
Next, Kim Yeon-su.

194
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,109
Kim Yeon-su placed first,
so alongside the scholarship certificate,

195
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,570
she'll receive an extra three million won.

196
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,529
Congratulations.

197
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,198
CHAEHWA GIRLS' HIGH SCHOLARSHIP,
THREE MILLION WON

198
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,324
Here.

199
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,577
A round of applause, please.

200
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,796
2024 CHAEHWA GIRLS' HIGH ACADEMIC CALENDAR

202
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,849
On the admission consultation form,

00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,143
put the top three majors
and universities of preference.

204
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,522

206
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,527
Hand in this semester's plans
for your school transcript,

207
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,696
and your school grade goals…

208
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,619
How many of you can get
into Hankuk Medical School?

209
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,124
-Any questions?
-Ms. Kim.

210
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,876
Which class is Yu Je-i in?

211
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,753
Why do you want to know?

212
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,963
But we do.

213
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,425
-We want to know. Tell us.
-We want to know. Tell us.

214
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,560
Yu Je-i.
You know I expect a lot from you, right?

215
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,729
I'll do my best.

216
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,275
The CSAT is 255 days away.

217
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,402
That's all.

218
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,318
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

219
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,327
Can I have it back?

220
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,886
Je-i, this is your seat.

221
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,138
I saved it for you.

222
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,505
-Nice to meet you. My name is--
-I know. It's Yu Je-i.

223
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,966
I heard it earlier.

224
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,024
Thanks to the equipment
you donate each year,

225
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,487
the medical club is our pride and joy.

226
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,157
I remember when it was first created.

227
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,327
Mr. Woo was so enthusiastic about it.

228
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,415
Shouldn't we have done more
to show our respects?

229
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,625
I feel guilty.

230
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,420
CSAT question-setters

231
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,256
can't even tell their families about it.

232
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,884
We were instructed
to strictly maintain secrecy,

233
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,304
so not even our teachers or staff
could attend the funeral.

234
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,639
Don't mind it too much.

235
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,183
DONATED BY J MEDICAL CENTER
YU TAE-JUN

236
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,934
Shall we have tea in my office?

237
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,478
Okay, then.

238
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,950
Hey, Transfer.

239
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,327
We need to swap seats.

240
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,454
Swap with me, not her. Please.

241
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,582
Aren't you guys being too shameless?

242
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,876
How can you ask
to sit next to Je-i for free?

243
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,670
Transfer, swap with me, not them.

244
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,673
If you do, I'll buy you
one thing that you want.

245
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,092
No limit on price. How's that?

246
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,595
Kim Na-ri, you're trying
to pay your way out again.

247
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,222
That puts us at a disadvantage.

248
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,765
Let's be fair
and play rock-paper-scissors.

249
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,808
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

250
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,977
Shoot.

251
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,103
-Shoot.
-Wait.

252
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,147
I don't want anything.

253
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,276
Na-ri.

254
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,070
Where do you sit now?

255
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,864
Me? In the center line,
second from the front.

256
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,576
It's right in front of the teacher's desk,
so you can hear them darn well.

257
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,328
And you get the full view
of the blackboard.

258
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,455
Okay, I'll swap with you.

259
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,706
Fuck yes.

260
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,707
Are you serious?

261
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,042
You study hard, Transfer?

262
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,044
Damn it. How disappointing.

263
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,714
Can I go now?

264
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,017
Tell me soon if you want anything.
Don't change your mind later.

265
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,771
Well, you must be loaded.

266
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
Can you buy me a building?

267
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,276
What?

268
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,990
Forget it. If you have money to waste,
buy more makeup.

269
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,997
I looked for you everywhere.

270
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,164
Let's go eat.

271
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,713
Quickly. I'm hungry.

272
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,983
