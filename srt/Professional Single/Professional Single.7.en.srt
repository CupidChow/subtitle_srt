1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 07

3
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Look at me.

4
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,040
Qin Shen,

5
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
it's already over.

6
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,280
Bravo!

7
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
Bravo!

8
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,480
Bravo!

9
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,520
I almost scared to death!

10
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,480
Yeah!

11
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
Who knows

12
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,145
there'll be such an embarrassed scene!

13
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,720
I mean

14
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm scared

15
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,000
because Qin Shen

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,080
was too handsome!

17
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,560
I almost had a crush on him!

18
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,080
Sorry.

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,800
Forget it!

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,160
I can take it as the arrow of Cupid.

21
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,080
Qin Shen,

22
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
thank you for helping me out.

23
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,040
Yuan Qian!

24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,080
Well done!

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,560
You can tell us directly

26
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,720
if you want to see him nude.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
And we'll take photos when he's showering.

28
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,840
The program has almost become X-rated

29
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,040
because of you.

30
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,920
Yuan Qian,

31
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,680
it turns out you're such a proactive girl!

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,040
No! I'm not!

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,240
I didn't mean to...

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
So you're really

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,000
interested in a nude Apollo.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
Keep three meters away from me

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
before I get dressed.

38
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,120
Let's go.

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,880
Qin.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,680
Bravo!

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Bravo!

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,400
Qin, you dirty bachelor!

43
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:10,720
How could you hug a girl in our class

44
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
just because you don't have a girlfriend?

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
How did it feel to hug Yuan Qian?

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,720
Take my advice,

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,200
don't get fresh with her.

48
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,840
Girls're easily to have a crush on you for that.

49
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,200
If I had the central position,

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,840
I'd be the one

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
who hugged Yuan Qian today.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,760
Chen Qinan, are you an animal?

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,120
How could you think like that?

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,440
I dare not!

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,680
Otherwise I'll be killed by someone surnamed Qin

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,920
when I'm sleeping.

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,480
Lu Jianing,

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,720
I'll be waiting outside.

59
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,440
OK.

60
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,800
Yuan Qian.

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
You've got changed already.

62
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,200
What?

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Feeling bad?

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
Let Qin Shen to dress like that again.

65
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,960
You should be responsible for what you've done.

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,160
You shouldn't like those...

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,800
- I'm so happy today! - Never mind.

68
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,920
I almost burst into tears when the Dean

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,840
was praising our department.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,480
Yes.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
Thank you,

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
you led us to earn this honor.

73
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Bravo.

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,280
My duty.

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,440
Yuan Qian.

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
I've told you this bag's too masculine.

77
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,680
Look,

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,040
it's same as the one of Qin Shen.

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Why did you buy this?

80
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,840
There're not many kinds of laptop bags.

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,040
This means it's cost-effective

82
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,560
since boys and girls have all bought it.

83
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,400
Bye.

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Bye.

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,840
Come on, let's go back.

86
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,440
Anyone wants to take a shower?

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
I got some business, I'll go later.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
Me! I'll go.

89
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
It feels the paints are still on me.

90
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,480
I won't, I'm so tired.

91
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,120
I'll sleep.

92
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
How could it be?

93
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Seriously? I...

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,520
What?

95
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,480
Forgot anything?

96
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,280
No.

97
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,160
I thought I've lost the lipstick,

98
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,920
it turns out I haven't taken one.

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,760
Grab your stuff and let's take shower.

100
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
Xuexue, you go first.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm tied up with the Reporter Club tonight,

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,720
I have to go out.

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
No!

104
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,880
I must have

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
put the transfer notice in Qin Shen's bag!

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,720
You can't buy a good stuff at a discount!

107
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,040
- Why am I so hapless? - Yuan Qian?

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,880
Haven't you left?

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why're you back?

110
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,080
I...

111
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,280
I've always see you as my brother!

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
Unexpectedly...

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,000
you wouldn't tell me about your transferring!

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
No one wanted to be your roommate

115
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,560
because they thought you're fat and stink.

116
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,960
It was I who persuaded them to accept you!

117
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Now you're leaving without telling me?

118
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,200
I was reassigned to this department.

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I don't like sculptures.

120
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,160
Do you think our department's useless?

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,480
You've transferred stealthily

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,560
because you despise us?

123
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
I'm not!

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,320
It won't affect our friendship even if I've transferred.

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,560
That's not what I mean.

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I think you don't take me

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,000
as a friend at all!

128
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
Save your words!

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,600
Transferring

130
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
is a personal opinion and choice.

131
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
There're no rights or wrongs.

132
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,240
You should respect each other as friends.

133
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,000
Fatty,

134
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,120
go back dorm.

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,040
It must be in Qin Shen's bag.

136
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,320
I'm not that lucky.

137
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,160
Looking for something?

138
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,320
No... no!

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,040
Well...

140
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
Qin, let's go.

141
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,000
What do you want to say?

142
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,080
Nothing.

143
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,000
Forget it.

144
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,280
What's up?

145
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,160
This class we'll make a sculpture of a man and a woman.

146
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Its name is...

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,880
traitor.

148
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,000
Sir, where're the models?

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,720
Behold!

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,440
I'll introduce two notorious traitors of our class!

151
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,680
Look at these bitches who want to transfer!

152
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,760
Yuan Qian?

153
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,640
You want to transfer without telling us?

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Oh my god!

155
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,640
Yuan Qian, how could you...

156
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,520
Yuan Qian,

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
I'm disappointed!

158
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
I... I'm not!

159
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,920
I don't want to transfer!

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,880
I... I like sculptures!

161
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Then explain this!

162
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,880
Evidence is here, forget to make excuses!

163
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,960
You traitor!

164
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

165
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,465
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

166
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,680
Traitor! Traitor!

167
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
It's a dream.

168
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,520
No.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
I must take the application sheet back.

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
I'll ask him for it tomorrow.

171
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey, have you had the breakfast?

172
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
Chen Qinan, you brazen man!

173
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,600
You're sick!

174
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,360
Why're you staring at me?

175
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,400
Anything wrong?

176
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,520
Because you're handsome.

177
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,400
Yuan Qian, brilliant love lines.

178
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Drink your soy-bean milk.

179
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
You sure there's nothing wrong?

180
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
Are you a fool?

181
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,960
She likes you!

182
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
The fact is...

183
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,080
I like your bag.

184
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,840
Don't you have a same one?

185
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,680
No! No!

186
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,640
Not the same!

187
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,000
Yours is prettier.

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,840
I want to buy one for my cousin,

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,720
can I see it in details?

190
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,595
I've sent you the shopping link.

191
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,040
All right.

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,320
Why does this milk taste so sweet?

193
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,840
I have to throw it away.

194
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,960
Yuan Qian, what're you doing?

195
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,280
Why're you always so reckless?

196
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm sorry!

197
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,480
She wouldn't have done that

198
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,760
if you didn't walk to her.

199
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,520
Bro!

200
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm the one who get wet by the milk!

201
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,800
So you've been a family

202
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,000
since you've hugged?

203
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,880
No, absolutely not!

204
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,880
This's gentleman's manner.

205
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm sorry!

206
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,280
Let me wash it.

207
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,360
Give them all to me.

208
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,280
I'll wash them for you.

209
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,720
No, forget it.

210
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,200
I soiled them, I should wash them.

211
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,840
It's just fine, I'll go back and change it.

212
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,760
But Qin, you should go with me.

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,040
Otherwise I'll be scolded for being absent.

214
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,840
You along will be scolded for that,

215
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,200
do you think we'll be safe together?

216
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,160
At least I have a company.

217
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,600
Let's go.

218
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,960
Give it to me.

219
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,120
You got my accompany, too!

220
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,640
Let's go!

221
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,440
Wipe it up.

222
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,840
You got an absence of mind?

223
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,960
Still thinking about that century hug

224
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,040
with Qin Shen?

225
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,080
I've heard it from Yi Ming,

226
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,440
you've been looking at Qin Shen soulfully

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
all the day.

228
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,720
What?

229
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,680
You're going to have a relationship?

230
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
How's that possible?

231
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,280
I did that for the performance.

232
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,600
You're blushing!

233
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,560
So Yi Ming was right.

234
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,160
Believe what you want.

235
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,400
Xinxin, could you be gentle?

236
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
Think for the door, OK?

237
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,200
Have you read what the supervisor

238
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
shot in our class group?

239
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Our Ancient Greek mythology show

240
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,720
was voted the most popular show in our school!

241
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,880
Qin Shen and Yuan Qian's century hug

242
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,640
has become a classic moment!

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,600
They've been post on our uni's microblog!

244
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Now there's an avalanche of comments!

245
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,240
Isn't it?

246
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
So many green-eyed guys!

247
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,760
Why did they cut me off?

248
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,920
That's girls' way!

249
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,280
Nobody else

250
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,600
deserves their school hunk.

251
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
I believe the official couple is the best.

252
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,240
Yuan Qian,

253
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,880
why did you send this in class group?

254
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,080
Class group?

255
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,080
Qin!

256
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,880
Check it out!

257
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,040
Yuan Qian expressed her feelings on you in the class group!

258
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,280
I believe

259
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,520
the official couple is the best.

260
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,320
Check it out!

261
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,480
That's great!

262
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,080
No, Yuan's not cool.

263
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,680
How could she only retouch herself?

264
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,160
I should score her about it.

265
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
As I know of Yuan Qian,

266
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,880
she can't be this quick!

267
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,720
Hey! Go away.

268
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,640
I'm sorry! Sorry.

269
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,000
You'd better go back to your seat.

270
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,040
Want to be watched by so many people?

271
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,400
Nice weather, huh?

272
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
Let me tell you again,

273
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,040
Qin Shen and I

274
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,880
are not having a relationship.

275
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
I'll make it public

276
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,480
if I have a boyfriend.

277
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,080
Yes. Yes. Yes.

278
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Right. Right.

279
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,840
This is a good one.

280
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,560
Listen to the following dialogue.

281
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,520
This homework is due in next week.

282
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,760
Why're you doing it so early?

283
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,760
I can do something else

284
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,880
if I finish it earlier.

285
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,560
You're really good at time management.

286
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,520
All right,

287
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,720
we'll hold a celebration party,

288
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,240
here's a mission for you.

289
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,560
Me?

290
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,560
I'm not suitable for it.

291
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,560
You must do it

292
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,480
by all means.

293
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,160
Fine.

294
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,400
What is it?

295
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,280
Quite simple.

296
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,800
You'll check this farm out

297
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,640
where we'll hold the party.

298
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,080
Meet other guys at the bus stop

299
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,000
outside of the uni's gate at eight o'clock

300
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,280
tomorrow morning.

301
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
There's other guys?

302
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,960
Will the farmer pick me up?

303
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,680
Qin Shen, morning.

304
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,480
Waiting for someone too?

305
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,880
You're going to the farm?

306
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,480
How do you know?

307
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,200
Me too.

308
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,480
She didn't tell me this.

309
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,840
Yi Ming's nasty!

310
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,520
What?

311
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,520
Let's go.

312
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,520
So you've washed your bag?

313
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,760
And you're taking it with you?

314
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
You're quite interested in my bag recently.

315
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
How long before we get to the farm?

316
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,280
It's a long way, take a nap.

317
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
OK.

318
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,040
No wonder I couldn't find it,

319
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,840
it's in the front pocket.

320
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Maybe Qin Shen didn't know it either.

321
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,840
Hi there.

322
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,840
Here's the deposit.

323
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,280
Thank you!

324
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,080
Have some water,

325
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,680
I'll make a invoice for you.

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,600
Thank you.

327
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,360
Qin Shen,

328
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,480
do you want to have a use of the bathroom?

329
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,080
Do you want me

330
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,920
to go there with you?

331
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,720
No, no.

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,920
I mean,

333
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,760
since you've drunk too much water,

334
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,320
I believe you have to.

335
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,360
I can take care of your bag.

336
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,800
I have the invoice.

337
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,250
You want to use the bathroom?

338
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,000
All right,

339
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,400
walk out of this door and turn left,

340
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,180
then turn left again, and you'll see it.

341
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,720
Listen,

342
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,200
I'll fetch you

343
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,680
some fruits in the kitchen.

344
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,010
Make yourself at home here.

345
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,680
Thank you, sir.

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,720
You're welcome.

347
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Just go.

348
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,280
Why're you so weird today?

349
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,600
Am I?

350
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,960
I don't need to go.

351
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,400
I see.

352
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Qin, what're you reading?

353
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,040
Why're you hiding it?

354
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,680
What's that?

355
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,880
Go away!

356
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
OK, I'll go.

357
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,280
By the way,

358
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
you haven't show anything to Yuan Qian.

359
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,120
Don't tell me

360
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
you couldn't see her affection on you.

361
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,960
She had shown her feeling too obvious,

362
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,880
yet you've done nothing!

363
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Aren't you ashamed?

364
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,440
I don't think she was...

365
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
What?

366
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,880
Nothing.

367
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,760
Thanks.

368
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,080
He needs to brush teeth with a bag?

369
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,040
Aren't we going to the farm?

370
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,120
Why're you taking the bag?

371
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,475
The deposit invoice's in there.

372
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,830
Put it in pocket, I'll take this back.

373
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:35,320
No.

374
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Wait for me!

375
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,720
That's weird.

376
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,400
Isn't this a class's party?

377
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,680
Why the outsiders are here, too?

378
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
Song Siyi had gave us a hand.

379
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,520
Besides, Xuexue chose him, not me.

380
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,880
You know Xuexue,

381
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,120
she's suggestible.

382
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,760
Yuan Qian.

383
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,160
Luo Xinxin, Lu Jianing.

384
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
Did you have breakfast?

385
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,200
Take one, each of you.

386
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,960
Xue Congyang has just had one.

387
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,320
Thanks.

388
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm good, I don't like bread.

389
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Give me the rest!

390
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,400
It's about the time.

391
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,560
Let's go.

392
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,840
It's the time to go.

393
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,640
The bus will be here.

394
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,480
Let's go. Let's go.

395
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
Let's go.

396
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,200
Let's go.

397
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,920
Go go go.

398
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,600
Let's go.

399
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Come on, follow us.

400
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,280
The bus's here.

401
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Yuan Qian, after you.

402
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,080
OK.

403
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,040
Qin, hurry up.

404
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,800
God!

405
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,520
What a shabby place!

406
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
My AJ will be frayed!

407
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,240
All you know is AJ!

408
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,120
He's right.

409
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Monitor,

410
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,120
Did you casually find this place for us?

411
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,800
Yeah.

412
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,560
I made the decision

413
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,305
because I thought this place's nice

414
00:24:58,305 --> 00:24:59,240
as I took a main road last time.

415
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,480
Why don't you take a look first?

416
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,440
The farmer won't give me the money back.

417
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,800
Since it was you who made the decision,

418
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,440
why don't you

419
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,240
pay me the money?

420
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,120
Qin Shen!

421
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,640
I made the decision, talk to me.

422
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,440
He's protecting his "wife".

423
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,360
The official couple's impressive!

424
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,000
Stop it.

425
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,440
That's my bag.

426
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,880
I was taking mine,

427
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,880
mine...

428
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,920
it's under yours.

429
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm here to take gloves

430
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,720
to I wash veggies.

431
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,560
Look,

432
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,640
I'm here for it.

433
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,480
Maybe I shall find an opportunity

434
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,560
to send him away

435
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,880
and check his bag.

436
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,720
Here's the fish!

437
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,320
I've just caught them in the pond.

438
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,320
Roast them

439
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,920
when you're having the BBQ.

440
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,000
They'll be so fresh and tender!

441
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,320
By the way,

442
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,880
Clean them up when you kill them.

443
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,040
What're you doing?

444
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Kill the fish.

445
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,560
They'll taste better if pickled.

446
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,560
Don't tell me you dare not to kill it.

447
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,040
Step aside.

448
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,960
She has all your attention.

449
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,440
Look at that affectionate face!

450
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,440
Why do you have a soft spot

451
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,520
for a fish-killing girl?

452
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,480
Why did you let a girl to kill the fish?

453
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,480
Let me help you.

454
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,320
Someone may looks tall and strong,

455
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,440
but he dares not to kill a fish.

456
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,160
I don't like blood.

457
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,720
Someone won't even admit that

458
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,720
he doesn't have the gut.

459
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,440
I shouldn't have chosen to kill the fish,

460
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,280
I didn't have a spare hand to save my girl.

461
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,000
Stop it.

462
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,560
Well done!

463
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,960
Have some drinks.

464
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
Here's the meat.

465
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,240
Pass it to there.

466
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,305
You two, pass them there.

467
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,880
Thank you.

468
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,880
Yuan Qian, want some water?

469
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,800
Thank you.

470
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,640
Let's eat meat!

471
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,560
Chengren,

472
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,440
I want to apologize to you

473
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,800
by this chance.

474
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,320
I was wrong.

475
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,920
I should respect your choice.

476
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,760
We'll always be good friends

477
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,960
no matter which class or department you'll be in!

478
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,360
Actually Jia Sicheng doesn't want to lose

479
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,320
any member of our class.

480
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,600
We're so famous for unity

481
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,280
in the university after all.

482
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,240
The truth is

483
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,360
I chose this department without an aim.

484
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,080
I didn't know what I like.

485
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
I chose design

486
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,400
since my parents want me to,

487
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,440
but was reassigned to sculpture.

488
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,440
I really had a good time with you.

489
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,240
I really did.

490
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,160
Perhaps

491
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,120
I shouldn't leave.

492
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,520
I knew

493
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
you wouldn't abandon us!

494
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,480
Come on.

495
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,080
Raise your glass of youth!

496
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,160
A toast to our forever united department!

497
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,960
Right, our department's so fraternal,

498
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,960
only a fool will leave!

499
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,480
Right!

500
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,840
You can't find such a guy here!

501
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,800
We all shall stay,

502
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,160
none of us shall leave!

503
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,800
Come on.

504
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,680
Cheers!

505
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,400
I didn't eat it before you came.

506
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,160
All right,

507
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,440
eat it now.

508
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,800
I almost couldn't resist it!

509
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,560
You haven't seen

510
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,440
how Qin watched Yuan today.

511
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,320
He was

512
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,360
so affectionate!

513
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
Maybe he was thinking,

514
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,280
how could there be

515
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,080
such a pretty fish-killing girl in this world!

516
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,080
Qin,

517
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,400
you do have a special taste!

518
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,520
Fell into her for she killed a fish?

519
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,800
Won't you be crazy for her seeing her killing chickens?

520
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,720
Crazy in love.

521
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
You two need to see a doctor.

522
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,520
Qin,

523
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,840
surrender.

524
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,840
The true love has befallen on you.

525
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,360
That fish-killing girl is yours.

526
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,720
She's not.

527
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
She's not yours,

528
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,880
but you're already hers.

529
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,240
She'll stick to you

530
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,440
when she sees you.

531
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,520
She almost follow you to our door!

532
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,440
I told you she's not.

533
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,040
Why did Qin Shen look at me

534
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,680
in that way?

535
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,560
He has read it?

536
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,320
I don't think so.

537
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,240
No, I'd better take that sheet back!

538
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,680
What does transferring have anything to do with betraying?

539
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,960
I love oil painting, I'll do it!

540
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,640
Xinxin,

541
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,960
don't you think

542
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,760
our two rooms

543
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,560
will be linked by romantic relationships?

544
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,120
You'll be linked with our toilet?

545
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,080
I mean Qin Shen and Yuan Qian.

546
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
Don't you think it's quite obvious?

547
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,440
Look, Yuan Qian has already shown her feeling.

548
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,720
But Qin Shen's so obtuse.

549
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,280
I've thought about it and I wanna help.

550
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,680
Let's play room escape game this weekend,

551
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,000
the four of us.

552
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,680
You and I will leave halfway,

553
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,400
so that they can...

554
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,840
Hope it'll work.

555
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,600
Yi Ming,

556
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,800
are you crazy?

557
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,720
Yuan Qian, we're leaving now.

558
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,040
Yuan Qian.

559
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,640
Still working?

560
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,000
Right, Yuan Qian,

561
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,560
what about playing room escape game

562
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,200
this weekend?

563
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,760
Just the two of us?

564
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
And my classmates.

565
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,680
I'll pass, I don't know them.

566
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
You'll be friends later.

567
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,760
Having a cyber love again?

568
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,400
Think as you like.

569
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,560
I'll do it,

570
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,920
you can take that away.

571
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,200
Qin,

572
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,370
you really don't wanna come?

573
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,360
Room escape game

574
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,200
is really funny!

575
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,520
It'll test your IQ.

576
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,480
My IQ doesn't need a test,

577
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,440
yours can't stand a test.

578
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
I've made the appointment,

579
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,520
you must join me!

580
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,920
It has nothing to do with me.

581
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,880
This's a four people's game!

582
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,960
Four people!

583
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,320
Find Yi Ming.

584
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,360
He's unattractive

585
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,400
for the girls.

586
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,960
What on earth do you want?

587
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,320
Here's the thing,

588
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,480
I want to hit up on Luo Xinxin,

589
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,680
so I've invited Luo Xinxin and Yuan Qian.

590
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,360
I want you to be my wingman.

591
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
We're brothers,

592
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,840
do me a favor.

593
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,040
Qin,

594
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,480
help me.

595
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,440
I really...

596
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,240
When?

597
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,040
Nine o'clock, Sunday morning.

598
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,880
Yuan Qian,

599
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,720
did you have your sheet stamped?

600
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,910
Why haven't you handed it in?

601
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm not in the campus.

602
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
I'll hand it in when I'm back.

603
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,000
Be quick.

604
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,200
This's important,

605
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,080
it's serious.

606
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,720
I got it, sir.

607
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
Yuan Qian.

608
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,360
Xinxin.

609
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,480
So you've invited Qin Shen

610
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,560
and Chen Qinan.

611
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,960
So?

612
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,480
Happy now?

613
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,640
I'm happy.

614
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm so glad to hang out with my classmates!

615
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,360
Let me check your bags in.

616
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,240
Wait.

617
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,400
Leave this matter to a gentleman.

618
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,640
Let her do it since she wants to.

619
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,800
Hold on, how about ours?

620
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,680
Thanks.

621
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,680
Qin,

622
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,360
don't you know how to be a gentleman?

623
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,200
See?

624
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
Am I right?

625
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,440
They're already pairing up!

626
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,240
You're right this time.

627
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,960
Let's stick to the plan later.

628
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,040
This game

629
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,400
will take at least one and a half hour.

630
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,680
You can make it in five minutes with me!

631
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,760
Come on!

632
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,800
Don't think I didn't know it.

633
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,080
Last time you've been crying for two hours

634
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,040
before the workers came to rescue you

635
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,280
and your weak teammates.

636
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,840
That's not the point!

637
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,000
The point is

638
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,360
we'll leave them inside,

639
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,240
then they'll be...

640
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,520
inseparable!

641
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,760
Qin Shen,

642
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,200
don't blame me.

643
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm well-behaved normally.

644
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,080
It's weird, I remember I've put it in here.

645
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,000
Looking for this?

646
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:57,180
Can we find some clues here?

647
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,250
Yes!

648
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,800
Brave people, thanks for coming.

649
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm Zhang Yi, the leader of a secret team, C11.

650
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,280
My men and I were trapped.

651
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,360
You'll need seven keys to rescue us.

652
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,360
Time's short, please pair up

653
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,400
and find the key.

654
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,720
You'll be locked here forever

655
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,320
like us

656
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,880
if you exceed ninety minutes.

657
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,760
Pair up?

658
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,520
Then I must stay with Chen Qinan.

659
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,720
You can't help a person with a low IQ like him!

660
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,600
OK, that's settled!

661
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,240
We'll leave first.

662
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,040
Let's go!

663
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,960
Luo Xinxin's IQ can't help him either.

664
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,160
Leave them be.

665
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,040
Let's find the keys.

666
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,800
Wait for me.

667
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,760
I...

668
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,880
You're still transferring?

669
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,640
To oil painting?

670
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,480
I was reassigned to the Sculpture Department.

671
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
You knew this.

672
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,720
And I planed to transfer from the very beginning!

673
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,360
Our department is good,

674
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,280
but I've promised my dad,

675
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,760
I have to do it.

676
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,800
If you think I'm a traitor for this,

677
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,840
you can tell the others.

678
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,240
I'm ready for it!

679
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,440
You think you'll be a traitor for transferring?

680
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,840
Of course not!

681
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,920
You're right to pursue your original aspiration.

682
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,280
Will you tell my roommates?

683
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
I'm not that boring.

684
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,800
Is this English?

685
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,920
Do you know it means?

686
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,200
No, they're disordered.

687
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,480
Then why're you playing a cool guy here?

688
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,840
Let's find another clue.

689
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,760
We're running out of time!

690
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,320
They look almost the same,

691
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,920
but there's one difference.

692
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
