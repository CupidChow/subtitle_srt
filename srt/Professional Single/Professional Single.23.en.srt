1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 23

3
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
Qin Shen is guarding beside like the God of Door.

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,760
I'm so stressed.

5
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,640
It's like a teacher checking a class.

6
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm more stressed, okay?

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
You just treat him as the project leader

8
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
who is checking the situation.

9
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,200
Helen of Troy!

10
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,200
Is there a kettle?

11
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,720
I've ran out of water.

12
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,360
Here you are.

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,840
Okay, okay.

14
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,405
Here you are.

15
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,560
Luo Xinxin, look here.

16
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,920
Yuan Qian,

17
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,080
you made it lifelike!

18
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
Your skills are very good!

19
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,200
It's actually very good.

20
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,440
Such a good restore.

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
You are real childhood sweethearts.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
His appearance is in your heart.

23
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,280
I am just gifted.

24
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,200
Yes.

25
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,360
Gifted!

26
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,280
Let me help you.

27
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,320
Let me help you.

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,040
Hurry up.

29
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,640
I want to go out to take a rest.

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Yeah.

31
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:26,920
Good, good.

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,400
Okay, okay.

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Stretch out a little bit.

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
You have changed a lot after you fell in love.

35
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,480
Not really.

36
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
It's just that there are more concerns.

37
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,720
Yes.

38
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,560
We have known each other for years.

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,920
You don't even look at me now.

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,360
No.

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
Qin Shen is so jealous.

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,000
We need to avoid suspicion.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,960
However,

44
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,800
do not worry,

45
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,360
We're still friends.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm an elite.

47
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
Haven't you regret it

48
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,800
after you chose Qin Shen?

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,920
No, no.

50
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Qin Shen is very nice.

51
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,440
He is very handsome with a very good figure.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,840
He helped me a lot.

53
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,280
He is the light in my life.

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,800
How can I regret?

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,160
I'll never regret it.

56
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,160
We have always been rejected.

57
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,160
Don't say we won't get the prize.

58
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,417
I'm afraid we'll lose the qualification for the competition.

59
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,360
What about...

60
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
we ask Qin Shen?

61
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,080
He is the person in charge anyway.

62
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,640
Yes, yes.

63
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
Can't we make it without Qin Shen?

64
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,960
Qin Shen happens to be here.

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
Qin Shen,

66
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,760
could you help our group?

67
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,560
To maximize the effect,

68
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,480
my suggestion is, redo it.

69
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,080
Redo it?

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
We don't have enough time to redo it.

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,480
And I don't think the problem is that serious.

72
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,440
It just needs to change a little bit, right?

73
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,080
Yes.

74
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,040
The problem is the style.

75
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,480
This delicate and feminine theme

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
is not suitable for your rough style.

77
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,760
I think you can come up with a better concept.

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
Prof. Jin didn't let us to redo it.

79
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,280
You just came and said we need to redo it?

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
I just gave my own advice.

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,600
It's your decision whether to redo it or not.

82
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,880
What's his attitude!

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
We just refuted him, and he showed an ugly face and left.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
It was not the first time he act in this anyway.

85
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,000
What do you think?

86
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,760
I know,

87
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
now this work,

88
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,400
is indeed not good as expected.

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,120
But I will try to polish it,

90
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
to slowly keep up with the progress.

91
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,080
Your idea

92
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,440
is delicate and gentle.

93
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,880
But you work is too rough.

94
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Mix-and-match? But it can't match.

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,200
Even if you show it up,

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
the effect will not be too good.

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,880
I suggest you

98
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
to discuss it more with Qin Shen.

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,200
Sir.

100
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,680
When I first proposed the direction of MGA,

101
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,760
everyone thought it was good.

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,760
It was Qin Shen who denied our idea.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,800
Now the direction on customs don't present well,

104
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
then we might as well

105
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,714
change it back to the former direction?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,920
Don't be so stubborn,

107
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,160
adjust your minds and attitudes.

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,680
Qin Shen had already told me

109
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,480
about your conversations.

110
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
I think Qin Shen's interpretation is correct.

111
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
You just listen to him.

112
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Sir.

113
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
Sir, I'm as good as Qin Shen.

114
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,400
You can't just listen to him.

115
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,760
Jia Sicheng.

116
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,320
Sorry, sir,

117
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,280
He is too excited now.

118
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,840
Sicheng,

119
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
the reason why we work so hard to do this

120
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,600
is to get the prize

121
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,200
and to allow our Sculpture Department to survive.

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,200
So we have to calm down.

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
Come to me if you have any difficulties.

124
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,680
Jia Sicheng,

125
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
How can you have conflicts with the teacher?

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
What does it have to do with you?

127
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,000
I...

128
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,880
Why am I doing this to you, right?

129
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,200
Do you think I don't blame you anymore?

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,040
You and Qin Shen both take me as a laughing stock.

131
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,520
Are you very happy?

132
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
Am I so funny?

133
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,880
No.

134
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,840
Do you think I forgive you?

135
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,600
Listen,

136
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,348
I will never forget it my whole life

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,160
the wounds you gave me.

138
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,840
But it doesn't matter anymore.

139
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,720
The most important thing now is my sculpture.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,800
Jia Sicheng,

141
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,160
do you always hate me?

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,240
Yes.

143
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,240
I hurt you so much?

144
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,920
Sorry.

145
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
But I hope you can change back

146
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,160
to the sunny boy you used to be.

147
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
I am sorry.

148
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,720
I'm too capricious.

149
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,160
I did not consider your feelings.

150
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,200
The electricity went off all afternoon today.

151
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,800
We have to continue to do it after dinner.

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,280
Okay.

153
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,131
Otherwise, we can't keep up with the progress of others.

154
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
OK.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,240
Anyway, it'll as hot as in dog days without electricity.

156
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,120
The other groups must not go, either.

157
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,760
Everyone's progress is about the same.

158
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,160
Xinxin.

159
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
You should tentatively ask in the group

160
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
to see if other groups work overtime at night.

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,560
You can't go.

162
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,400
It's our sculpture.

163
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,160
You ruined it.

164
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
Do you know how much effort we put in it?

165
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,560
I didn't do that.

166
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,880
Then who did it?

167
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,640
You stood here as soon as I came in.

168
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,320
Big news.

169
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,200
What happened?

170
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,400
Someone in the group said,

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,120
Qin Shen smashed Jia Sicheng's sculpture.

172
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,251
He just got caught on the spot.

173
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh my God!

174
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
Really?

175
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,640
- What's the situation? - Let me see.

176
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,680
Don't stand here. Hurry up to the classroom.

177
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,760
It could not have been smashed by Qin Shen.

178
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,240
He was with me from afternoon to night.

179
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,788
There was no time for him to commit the crime.

180
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,754
He couldn't do such a boring thing, either.

181
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:47,760
It must be a misunderstanding.

182
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,560
You are his girlfriend. You must be for him.

183
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,920
I...

184
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
Don't pull her in.

185
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,600
This matter has nothing to do with her.

186
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,840
Work like yours

187
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,600
don't worth my effort.

188
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
Yes, you do look down on our work.

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,880
But why are you here?

190
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,200
Why did you come to the classroom?

191
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,880
You came to the sculpture classroom to smash the statue!

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,800
You bastard!

193
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Fatty, fatty.

194
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,280
Calm down, calm down.

195
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:11,440
It might be a misunderstanding.

196
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
Qin is not such a person.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,874
You protect your roommate.

198
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,960
What about my roommate?

199
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,960
Jia Sicheng, he...

200
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,920
That's the work of our entire team.

201
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,600
What's up?

202
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
What happened?

203
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,440
Sir, our sculpture was destroyed.

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
I suspect Qin Shen did it.

205
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,760
That's all Jia Sicheng's efforts.

206
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,920
He guided us one by one.

207
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
He helped us modify it bit by bit.

208
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
He hadn't slept well for days.

209
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,000
It is not me.

210
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,200
Who else could it be?

211
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,680
Calm down.

212
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Okay. I will investigate this matter.

213
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
You have classes tomorrow.

214
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,960
Everyone, go back.

215
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,920
Sir...

216
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Go back first.

217
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,840
Just go, go.

218
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,080
Go.

219
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,240
Let's go.

220
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Come with me.

221
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Let's go.

222
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,920
Don’t worry.

223
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,760
We'll go first.

224
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,320
Bye bye.

225
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,200
You meant to say,

226
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,440
when you arrived in the classroom,

227
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,920
the sculpture had already in that way?

228
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,600
Did you bump into anyone?

229
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,560
No.

230
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,840
OK. I will investigate it.

231
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,320
Don't care about it.

232
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,760
Prepare your competition work carefully.

233
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,720
Sir,

234
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,320
you know who it was, right?

235
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,400
You have also known who it was, right?

236
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,920
What did Mr. Jin talk to you?

237
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,280
Just knowing about the situation.

238
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,400
Have you both already know who did it?

239
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,320
It is Jia Sicheng, right?

240
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,440
Jia Sicheng has a habit.

241
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,760
When removing mud,

242
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
he would cut two knives in the mud.

243
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,960
It's like a big cross painted on the sculpture.

244
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,720
That sculpture was painted with a big cross.

245
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,800
Then it fell to pieces.

246
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,320
Now that you and Prof. Jin have known it,

247
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,760
what are you going to do?

248
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,560
He told me to leave it alone, he would handle it himself.

249
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,080
Then you won't care about it?

250
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,000
You leave it alone, too.

251
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,240
What do you do with your innocence?

252
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
It doesn't matter what others think of me.

253
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,120
I only care what you think of me.

254
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Even the whole world questions you,

255
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
I will be on your side.

256
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,480
I believe you.

257
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,240
The investigation result is out.

258
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Last night,

259
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,800
it was so windy.

260
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,640
The last left forgot to close the window.

261
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,360
The wind blew the curtains

262
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,400
and dragged down the work.

263
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,640
So,

264
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,880
no one was sabotaging.

265
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,040
I hope this matter

266
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,960
won't affect everyone's mood.

267
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Time is limited.

268
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,560
Hurry up, everyone.

269
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,960
Prepare your own work.

270
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,720
How could it be possible?

271
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,960
How could it be blown by the wind?

272
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,440
Impossible!

273
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,960
Sir,

274
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,720
Our sculpture weighed dozens of catties anyway.

275
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
What wind could blow it out?

276
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,160
Even trees can be uprooted when the wind is strong.

277
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,720
Your sculpture weighing several kilos,

278
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,040
why couldn't it be lifted?

279
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,880
That's right.

280
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,520
Our Qin had no hatred with you.

281
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,400
Smashing this sculpture was in vain.

282
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,320
It won't make him money.

283
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,360
Why could he do this?

284
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,360
How do I know why.

285
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay, stop it.

286
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,160
I tell you all the time,

287
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,920
the work should be placed in the middle of the workbench.

288
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,800
Try not to lean by the window.

289
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,920
Have you all listened to me?

290
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
Ours was not by the window.

291
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,280
Okay.

292
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,360
Try to catch up.

293
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
I'll be back at the weekend.

294
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,280
You come back alone?

295
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,760
What about the little girl last time?

296
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,880
She won't come back with you?

297
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
I'll be back alone.

298
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
That little girl was very cute last time.

299
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
I like her very much and want to see her.

300
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,000
When you have time,

301
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
take her back for a visit.

302
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay, grandma, let me persuade her.

303
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,480
Qin, you and Yuan Qian are making great progress.

304
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,617
This has developed to the point of meeting the parents.

305
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,560
What do you know?

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,080
Qin's plan,

307
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,622
is to give birth to the baby first during college.

308
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,400
When he graduates,

309
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
he'll take home his wife and kid with diploma

310
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,960
Is Qin like this?

311
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,800
How can it be enough to just have one kid?

312
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,240
Of course it will be two in three years.

313
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,400
Right, Qin?

314
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,960
Good suggestion.

315
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,040
Gosh!

316
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,000
In this world,

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,697
someone just like to display affections publicly.

318
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,080
He's stimulating us.

319
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,400
I envy you.

320
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,240
Haven't you asked about Yuan Qian's thoughts?

321
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,600
Maybe you've been self-sentimental .

322
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,520
Don't be jealous.

323
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,240
Talk to me

324
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,200
when you have a girlfriend.

325
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,200
Let me do it.

326
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:55,440
It has not been finished yet,

327
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,840
and you let me washed my hands.

328
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,120
Should I just stand here and watch you?

329
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm like a jerk.

330
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,000
It's boring.

331
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,640
You are not happy to rest?

332
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,400
Why haven't I seen you so considerate before?

333
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,417
Why are you checking your phone all the time today?

334
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Answer the call for me.

335
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Hello.

336
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,360
Hi there.

337
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,120
Qin Shen is not convenient to answer the phone.

338
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,400
What do you...

339
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,360
Granny Qin...

340
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,331
Turn up the speaker.

341
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,520
You are Yuan Qian, right?

342
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,200
Yes, yes, it's me.

343
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,440
Hello, Granny Qin.

344
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
Don't call me Granny Qin.

345
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,120
Call me grandma.

346
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,200
Gran... grandma.

347
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,360
Yuan Qian.

348
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,280
Qin Shen will go home on weekends.

349
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
Could you come with him to see grandma?

350
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,120
Is it inconvenient for you?

351
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,800
It's okay if you are not convenient.

352
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,840
That's alright.

353
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,194
We can talk about it later when you are convenient.

354
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,480
I just heard that you are in love with Qin Shen.

355
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,960
I am very happy

356
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
and want to see you.

357
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,080
You see,

358
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,160
at this age, my legs are not that stong.

359
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,200
Otherwise I will go to school to see you.

360
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,040
Grandma, don't say that.

361
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,600
I'm free, free.

362
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,920
Qin Shen and I will go back to see you soon.

363
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,880
Really?

364
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Great, great, great.

365
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,160
I knew it.

366
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,280
Our Yuan Qian is a good girl.

367
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,880
That's settled.

368
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,880
I will prepare

369
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,800
many delicious food for you.

370
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,920
Qin Shen, take care of Yuan Qian,

371
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,080
you hear me?

372
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,560
You take care of yourself, too.

373
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,040
You did it on purpose, right?

374
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,240
You have been looking at the phone,

375
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,720
obviously you're waiting for the call.

376
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,960
You want to lead me into the trap?

377
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,080
Where are you going?

378
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,120
To wash hands.

379
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
What do you mean?

380
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,840
The work is not finished yet.

381
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,720
Do it yourself.

382
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,680
Artists must have the sense of independent creation.

383
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,360
You kick down the ladder!

384
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,040
Yuan Qian.

385
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
When will you leave? How many days will you stay?

386
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,600
From Thursday afternoon to Sunday afternoon.

387
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,960
Are you going to stay overnight at Qin Shen's house?

388
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Yes.

389
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,920
No!

390
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,960
I will stay at Qin Shen's house for two days.

391
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,320
Then I won't live in the same house with him?

392
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,200
Be quiet.

393
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
Both of them are asleep.

394
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,200
I haven't thought about this problem.

395
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
Where to sleep is indeed a big trouble.

396
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,200
I don't know how his family will arrange.

397
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,285
You just ask them directly.

398
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Why are you so surprised?

399
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,960
How can such a question be raised?

400
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,320
I'll help you.

401
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,760
Don't be troublesome.

402
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,280
No, why should I be diffident?

403
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,440
You often go to grandma's house?

404
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,480
Usually, when I was young.

405
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,400
When I went to high school, I was very busy then.

406
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
I only went back in Spring Festivals.

407
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,880
All of your family?

408
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,400
Did all of you have enough room to sleep?

409
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,800
Fine.

410
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,360
Fine?

411
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,760
Is that enough or not?

412
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,560
How big is grandma's house?

413
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,920
In a building or a bungalow?

414
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,200
You care about these?

415
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,560
No, no.

416
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
I lived in a small building when I was young.

417
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,040
So I miss the childhood

418
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,040
in a small building very much.

419
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,040
Oh, you missed the time

420
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,720
when you lived in the building with Song Siyi?

421
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,760
Your imagination is too rich.

422
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,520
I just want to know

423
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
if we two will live in the same room.

424
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,280
Of course we will.

425
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,360
Grandma's house is a small bungalow.

426
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,880
There are only two rooms.

427
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,560
If you don't live with me,

428
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
who do you live with?

429
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,480
Don't draw fantasies about me.

430
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
I... I don't.

431
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,440
Where are you going

432
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,200
with so many things?

433
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,040
To my grandma's house on Friday.

434
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,040
You alone?

435
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,560
With Yuan Qian?

436
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
I want to ask a question.

437
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
You go back together.

438
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,000
Where do you sleep?

439
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,920
Stop talking about it. It is abuses our singles.

440
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,400
Tell us some details.

441
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,600
We don't mind being abused.

442
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,960
Get out.

443
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,680
Wait.

444
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,240
Tmall Genie.

445
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,800
What?

446
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,440
Tell me the weather tomorrow.

447
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,640
I'm going out to play.

448
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,120
There will be rain showers in Xuanzhou tomorrow.

449
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,280
It is not suitable for going out.

450
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,880
Bro.

451
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,840
Fail to get in a relationship.

452
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,120
Come, stay with me, stay with me.

453
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,120
- No no no. - Stay with me.

454
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,960
Stay with me.

455
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,542
How could it fail?

456
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,720
Aren't you going to talk to Prof. Jin?

457
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,480
You finished talking so soon.

458
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,640
Yes.

459
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,080
Then let's go and have dinner.

460
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,120
Don't read it.

461
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,360
The must-have things first time

462
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,634
spending night with your boyfriend.

463
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,440
A conservative pajamas.

464
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,800
A sleeping bag.

465
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
A anti-wolf spray

466
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,120
I'm afraid you are young and vigorous.

467
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,920
So you don't want to contact me.

468
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,840
No, I just thought it's too quick of us to...

469
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,200
Yuan Qian.

470
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,200
Your hairstyle is good.

471
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,440
Luo Xinxin, if you continue to laugh,

472
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,840
I will throw you off the building.

473
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,120
Yuan Qian, it's not that I want to laugh at you.

474
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,640
You are going to see his family

475
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,120
with Qin Shen anyway.

476
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,760
Can't you find a better hair stylist?

477
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,040
Cheap ones are really not reliable.

478
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,120
This hairstyle is so ugly that I doubt my life.

479
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,160
I have never been so ugly in my whole life.

480
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,800
How should I meet people?

481
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,160
It's alright.

482
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,920
No matter how good you look,

483
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,680
you will never be better than Qin Shen.

484
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,600
Why bother it then?

485
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,480
Go away!

486
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,240
Hey.

487
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,640
Let's go to eat. I'll wait for you downstairs.

488
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,840
I have had meal with my roommate.

489
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Then let's go for a walk.

490
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,840
I don't like strolling.

491
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,320
And I just went out.

492
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
It's hot outside.

493
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,000
I have taken a shower.

494
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,480
If I go down, I need to change clothes again.

495
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,640
That's too tiring.

496
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,160
Where are you?

497
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,000
I...

498
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,960
I am here.

499
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,680
I'm coming.

500
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,840
What's up? Luo Xinxin.

501
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,200
Luo Xinxin's calling me.

502
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm scared.

503
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,960
Qin Shen came to check on you.

504
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,040
It's useless for you to use me as a shield.

505
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,000
He doesn't believe your nonsense at all.

506
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,800
Don't tell the truth.

507
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,400
It's useless to not tell the truth.

508
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,840
Anyway you have class tomorrow.

509
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,960
You have to face him.

510
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,720
Come back.

511
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,040
Why are you wearing a hat indoors?

512
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,040
I just got cold.

513
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,520
My head can't catch wind.

514
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,120
You have a cold?

515
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,520
A little bit.

516
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,280
But not too serious.

517
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,400
I just can't blow.

518
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,920
Can't you?

519
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,760
Yes.

520
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,680
This is your reason for not seeing me these days?

521
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,520
Laugh if you want.

522
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,440
Don't hold back.

523
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,160
I know I'm ugly now.

524
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,720
Not ugly.

525
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,640
Anyway, there is no way to remedy it.

526
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,400
It's so ugly.

527
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,040
I can't go to grandma's house with you.

528
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,960
Otherwise grandma will dislike me even more.

529
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,771
She'll think that you have a problem with your taste.

530
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,440
Yuan Qian.

531
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,840
Here.

532
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,640
What's this?

533
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,040
A hairpin.

534
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
What else can it be?

535
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,000
I've had it enough of your showing affections,

536
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
and I have to deliver things to you for him.

537
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,320
What kind of world is this?

538
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,760
Qin Shen gave it to me?

539
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,120
Then who else can it be?

540
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,440
This looks like he carefully selected for you.

541
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,440
Let's forget about naive men's aesthetics.

542
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,040
Naive men's aesthetics?

543
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,520
That's more normal than yours.

544
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,680
Just so-so.

545
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,600
Duplicity.

546
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,360
I'm leaving.

547
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,120
In such a short time,

548
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,880
it's really difficult for you

549
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,440
to make a new one.

550
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,280
I know

551
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,800
you guys have worked very hard.

552
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,240
You also want to contribute to the Sculpture Department.

553
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,120
But time is limited.

554
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,960
Your team, don't participate in the competition this year.

555
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's wait for the next year.

556
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,800
Then...

557
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,080
sir,

558
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,720
is this really bad?

559
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
It's too rough even if it can be finished.

560
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
Just polish your own mind.

561
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,200
Let's go, bro Nan.

562
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,640
Let's go.

563
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,000
Bye bye.

564
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,600
Bye bye.

565
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
Bye bye.

566
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,640
Go.

567
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,280
We can't participate in the competition.

568
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
You happy now?

569
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,080
Why should he be happy?

570
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,920
Did you threaten him to win,

571
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,000
or he's your enemies?

572
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:23,880
You ask him.

573
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,440
I don't believe in wind destroyed our work.

574
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,920
Prof. Jin likes you and shields you.

575
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,240
I have nothing to say.

576
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,960
But if you think

577
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,160
after you hurt Jia Sicheng, a hard-working man,

578
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
and you can always be No.1,

579
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,440
then that's impossible.

580
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,640
Even if Jia Sicheng wasn't hurt,

581
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,600
he will be...

582
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,600
I don't make it widely known,

583
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,600
just because I care about

584
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,800
the Sculpture Department

585
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,840
and someone.

586
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,040
Everyone is an adult now.

587
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,400
Someone should be responsible for what he has done.

588
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,760
You really don't plan

589
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,360
to tell the truth?

590
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,840
The problem is not whether I say it or not,

591
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,080
but is whether Jia Sicheng commits it.

592
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,160
Did you have a conflict with him?

593
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
I think he hates you much.

594
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,920
It's because of Ling Wei?

595
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,080
I find that every time he sees Ling Wei,

596
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,480
his expressions are weird.

597
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,880
He likes Ling Wei, right?

598
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,360
He and I used to be best friends.

599
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,280
He had a high artistic talent since he was a child.

600
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,000
He shouldn't be like this now.

601
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Jia Sicheng,

602
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I have something to tell you.

603
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,720
It’s so hot. Don't bask here.

604
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,440
It is quite hot.

605
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,880
Give me a chance, shall we talk?

606
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
What's the matter?

607
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Jia Sicheng,

608
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,320
I am sorry.

609
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,760
I used to be too selfish and capricious.

610
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,560
I haven't consider the feelings of others at all.

611
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,360
I hurt you like this.

612
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,720
I am really sorry.

613
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,720
Like what?

614
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,040
I'm fine now.

615
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,360
The question you asked me before,

616
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,680
I am sorry,

617
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,160
I give you a reply after so long.

618
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,320
I am leaving.

619
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,080
Jia Sicheng,

620
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,160
I must say sorry to you first

621
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,640
for my selfishness and capricious.

622
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
You have a warm and sweet mind.

623
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,920
I hope you can keep sweet.

624
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
If it is possible,

625
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,960
I hope returning your classmates' card and the answers

626
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,120
can end this chaos in our youth.

627
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,920
I hope you can return to the way you used to be.

628
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,840
I hope you can put down everything

629
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,560
and be the brilliant you again.

630
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,960
I believe

631
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,400
you will have a better future

632
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,440
with a better girl.

633
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,400
Good luck.

634
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Hello, my name is Ling Wei.

635
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,080
My name is Jia Sicheng.

636
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,320
Didn't you go to grandma's house with Yuan Qian?

637
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,240
Why haven't you left yet?

638
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,040
I won't go.

639
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,680
Why?

640
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,520
I have to stay

641
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
and help Jia Sicheng's group to deal with the sculpture.

642
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,040
You still need me to teach you in your age?

643
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,640
You cancelled it as you wanted.

644
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,560
Won't "Sister-in-law" be angry?

645
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,720
She thought the same as me.

646
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
We have discussed it.

647
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,320
Sure, you are family.

648
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,920
You have mutual affinity.

649
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,160
Where are you going?

650
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,920
Everyone, please stop your work.

651
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,960
This time the sculpture was seriously damaged.

652
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,960
If we overturn all of it and remake it,

653
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
time may not be enough.

654
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,400
What shall we do then?

655
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,680
Let's combine the damaged part

656
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,480
and the remaining part,

657
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,200
and redefine a theme

658
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,280
implying rebirth in ruins.

659
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,600
Rebirth...

660
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,920
Yes.

661
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,120
This can represent not only our Sculpture Department,

662
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,840
but also Xuanzhou City's

663
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,440
history and outlook,

664
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,840
which was once glorious in history

665
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,560
but had been gradually forgotten.

666
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,320
It also fits the theme of this city sculpture exhibition.

667
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,160
Great idea!

668
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,000
I agree!

669
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Then I agree!

670
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,200
I also agree!

671
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,040
I think it's much more innovative than before.

672
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,960
Objection.

673
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,000
You ruined our work,

674
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,400
and replaced our idea with your own idea.

675
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,640
Why should I all listen to you?

676
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,040
You just want to be a good person.

677
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,320
This is your purpose.

678
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,880
Then use your idea.

679
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,200
Liu Chengren,

680
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,640
everyone is trying to keep the Sculpture Department.

681
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
Time is running out now.

682
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,480
Can't you let go of your prejudices?

683
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,640
Right.

684
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,960
Prof.. Jin had said that Qin Shen did not do it.

685
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,840
