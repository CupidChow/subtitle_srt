1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 20

3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
I fought along the way

4
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,560
and finally got the right to wear your necklace.

5
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
This was meant for you.

6
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,520
Why didn't you pick cellphone?

7
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,200
It can be bartered for so many necklaces.

8
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,800
Shallow.

9
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,040
From the first love to forever.

10
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,272
First Love Forever
From the first love to forever.

11
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:31,280
From the first love to forever.

12
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Thank you.

13
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,080
I like it.

14
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,640
Look. It's cute.

15
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,600
Ling Wei.

16
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,680
Qin Shen gave you that necklace?

17
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Yeah.

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,520
Why did he gave it to you?

19
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,920
He is my boyfriend.

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,360
Why can't he give it to me?

21
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
You are dating him?

22
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,120
Yeah.

23
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,320
When did that start?

24
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,920
On my birthday.

25
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,680
But we didn't make it public for some reason.

26
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,200
Some reason?

27
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,920
I think you know better than anyone

28
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,640
what the reason is.

29
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,680
Ling Wei.

30
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,320
I want to ask you about something.

31
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,440
Can you tell me the truth?

32
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,840
OK.

33
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,160
You were close to me

34
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,200
because you found Qin Shen likes me, right?

35
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
I was just curious how is the girl

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
he likes.

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,040
You gave me the present and helped me to find the job.

38
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,560
You did all that with other purpose?

39
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,160
I wanted you to know that I was good to you.

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
And you were not serious

41
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,080
when you told me not to give up on Qin Shen,

42
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,720
right?

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,240
I like him.

44
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
And I don't want him

45
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,880
to be with any other girl except for me.

46
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
And you let me see the depression medicine

47
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,440
on purpose, right?

48
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,240
I wanted to take my chances.

49
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,040
I wondered would you give up on him because of me.

50
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,920
It turned out you wouldn't.

51
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,880
And I shouldn't have done that.

52
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,120
Ling Wei. Thank you for being honest.

53
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,040
I really wanted to be your friend.

54
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,640
But, just now, it became clear to me

55
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,200
that I didn't owe it to you,

56
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,560
I owed it to Qin Shen.

57
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,200
Yuan Qian.

58
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm done. Let's go.

59
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,960
Qin Shen.

60
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,160
You heard what I said.

61
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Can you tell me

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,680
why is she better than me?

63
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,640
I don't care if she's better than you.

64
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,480
What matters is that I like her.

65
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Easy.

66
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Why do you hit me?

67
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,680
You like me, right?

68
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,640
What?

69
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
What? What?

70
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Yuan Qian. Come here.

71
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm guilty.

73
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm so cruel,

74
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
and I have to hurt you.

75
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,080
What?

76
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,680
What?

77
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,800
That's too much.

78
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Not afraid any more?

79
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm determined now,

80
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
so I'm not.

81
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,240
What are you doing?

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,880
What are you looking at?

83
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,960
You haven't seen enough?

84
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,440
I have. I'm sorry.

85
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
It's my fault.

86
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,160
It is

87
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,640
unbearable!

88
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,720
What's that?

89
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,600
To give you a proper name.

90
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:43,750
The first time in my life.
Yuan Qian

91
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,560
Check the phone.

92
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,600
The first time in your life?

93
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Your boyfriend is touched.

94
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,640
What does it say?

95
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,640
The first time in my life.

96
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,360
Gosh!

97
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,920
Gross!

98
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
Wei. Have some porridge.

99
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
Wei. You have to eat.

100
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
Or you won't bear it.

101
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,760
I really can't just give him up.

102
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,600
Yeah. But you still have to eat.

103
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,240
Yuan Qian.

104
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,000
You kept the thing between you two all the secret.

105
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,800
We don't care.

106
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,400
You have to pay us with a big meal.

107
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,200
And we won't go easy on you.

108
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,120
Alright. Alright.

109
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,920
Just make your order.

110
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,720
OK.

111
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
You can gain another 10 kg by this.

112
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,920
Welcome.

113
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,760
Qin Shen.

114
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
Yuan Qian. You're ready for your wedding with the red outfit?

115
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,440
It's the couple outfit?

116
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,880
I just grabbed a dress

117
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,040
and I didn't think too much.

118
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,800
It's too much!

119
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,680
You are not

120
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,200
one of us anymore.

121
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,720
I don't care.

122
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
I will turn my grieve into desire for food.

123
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,040
Your lovey-dovey behavior

124
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,960
has hurt us.

125
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,120
To avoid seeing that,

126
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,880
we will order more dishes to keep ourselves busy.

127
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,280
Jut make your order.

128
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,360
Whatever you want.

129
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,560
Why do you wear red too?

130
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,720
I have to be serious about it

131
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,760
because it's important.

132
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,960
They are laughing at me.

133
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,880
They are envying you.

134
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,280
Qin Shen.

135
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,840
You are in love with our Yuan Qian now,

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,800
so

137
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,840
you are officially our "son-in-law".

138
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,960
"Mother-in-law."

139
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
Don't say that!

140
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
We are young and little fairies.

141
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,560
Yuan Qian.

142
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,800
Are you sure you won't give a second thought about him?

143
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,800
I want to thank you

144
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,720
for taking care my Yuan Qian.

145
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,000
Please order anything you want.

146
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,000
She is yours now?

147
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,840
Qin Shen. As you wish.

148
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,840
Don't regret it.

149
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,800
Are you really gonna do that?

150
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,760
You are not married to him yet.

151
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,120
But you've already chosen your side.

152
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,640
Qin Shen.

153
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,760
Look. Yuan Qian is so good to you.

154
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
You have to treat her well.

155
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,880
Of course.

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,560
OK.

157
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,560
What should we order?

158
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
I want Braised Pork.

159
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,440
Xuexue, what do you want?

160
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,880
I want fish.

161
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Let's have Fish in Vinegar Gravy.

162
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,400
Tell us the truth!

163
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,800
Who made the first move?

164
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:20,960
Me.

165
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,240
Have you hold your hands?

166
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,480
Have you kissed then?

167
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,400
No.

168
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,280
He nodded!

169
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,040
Yuan Qian is lying!

170
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,280
Punishment! Punishment!

171
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,440
Wait.

172
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
Since you both wear red today...

173
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,320
Cross-cupped wine!

174
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,840
Cross-cupped wine!

175
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Cross-cupped wine!

176
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,320
Cross-cupped wine!

177
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
Cross-cupped wine!

178
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,880
Cross-cupped wine!

179
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,640
Cross-cupped wine!

180
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
Are you stupid?

181
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,480
I'm happy today.

182
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
Happy today.

183
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,440
Happy! Happy!

184
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,080
We are happy too.

185
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm so full.

186
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,320
Let me take it.

187
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,400
You asked for it.

188
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,200
You were gobbling

189
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,600
like it's your last meal.

190
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,520
I just didn't want to

191
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,400
waste any of the money.

192
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,840
Yuan Qian.

193
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,960
Has Song Siyi known about

194
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,880
the thing between Qin Shen and you?

195
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,680
He hasn't?

196
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,000
Should we tell him about it?

197
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,680
He was good to us.

198
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
Didn't you post it on the Moments?

199
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
He didn't see it?

200
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,560
No.

201
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,040
I blocked him.

202
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
Please don't tell him.

203
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,560
He's going to have a competition.

204
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,640
And I don't want him to be affected by this.

205
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
I will tell him

206
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
when the competition is over.

207
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,640
I have a thing to discuss with you.

208
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,880
What is it?

209
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,960
I want to have a meal with Song Siyi.

210
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,720
No.

211
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,520
He just finished his competition.

212
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,520
And I have to tell him about us.

213
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,560
Can't you tell him on the phone?

214
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,000
On the phone? He may think I'm not serious.

215
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Or he may think I'm forced to do it.

216
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
You want to meet him?

217
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Don't misinterpret my words.

218
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,160
I just think

219
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,360
it will show him that I'm serious to tell him in person.

220
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,920
Besides, I'm going to deal with your rival,

221
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,440
not going to cheat on you.

222
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,800
Don't be so nervous, OK?

223
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,880
Just this one time. It can't happen again.

224
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
I know you are the best.

225
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,640
Don't flatter me.

226
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,080
You have to promise me 5 things for it.

227
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,280
First, don't go places where no one is around.

228
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,040
Second, no physical contact.

229
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,560
Third, no more than 2 hours.

230
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,400
Forth, I am the most important.

231
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,400
Fifth.

232
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,000
OK. OK.

233
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,040
I will promise you

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
whatever you ask.

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
Outrageous.

236
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
It's too much.

237
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,600
Qin Shen.

238
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,720
Qin.

239
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,000
It's said you celebrated with the four in Yuan Qian's dorm

240
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,280
for being their "son-in-law"?

241
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,920
Shouldn't we also celebrate it

242
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,800
for having our "son" married?

243
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,600
What's in the picture Yuan Qian posted

244
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,000
is... is Qin Shen's hand?

245
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Of course.

246
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,760
Except for Qin, who have the ability

247
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,400
to win Yuan Qian's heart?

248
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
Needless to say,

249
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,720
Qin, your treat.

250
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,640
Your treat.

251
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
I want hot pot.

252
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,840
Move.

253
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,960
We have our "son" married.

254
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,160
You owe us a meal!

255
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,160
Right.

256
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,800
There should be a meal.

257
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,600
As the family members of the husband,

258
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,040
you should treat the family members of the wife with a meal.

259
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,720
Stingy.

260
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,920
So stingy.

261
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,920
They are together now.

262
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,040
I know.

263
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,040
You still want to wait for him?

264
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,840
Why not?

265
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,280
He may find who she truly is

266
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,400
and she's not right for him

267
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,160
after they spend some time together.

268
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,320
Ling Wei.

269
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,640
Stop fooling yourself.

270
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,160
What's up?

271
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Nothing.

272
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,920
I just feel like I will be punched

273
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,600
if I say something wrong.

274
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,040
Relax. I a professional athlete.

275
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm more fit

276
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,360
than those amateurs.

277
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,560
I can protect you.

278
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,200
I want to tell you something.

279
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,920
Well.

280
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,720
There are too many people here today.

281
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah.

282
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,400
There are a lot.

283
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,840
I asked you out to tell you...

284
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Can you

285
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,720
let me finish this drink?

286
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,480
I know what you want to say.

287
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,080
But Qin Shen is here.

288
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,520
I want to hear it in another place.

289
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,160
Let's go.

290
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,720
I remember when I first saw you

291
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,960
in the campus,

292
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,320
you couldn't swim and struggled in the water.

293
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,800
You looked awful.

294
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
Thanks to you,

295
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,080
or

296
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,160
I would die here.

297
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah.

298
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,400
But our story didn't go as I planned,

299
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,760
otherwise

300
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,520
I would be the one holding your hands now.

301
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,520
Yuan Qian.

302
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,600
I like you.

303
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,400
I know.

304
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,040
But I've been treating you like a friend.

305
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,760
I know.

306
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,840
I didn't said it

307
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,640
to cause you more trouble.

308
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,800
I said it to let it go.

309
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,680
And you just gave me your answer.

310
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,000
I think you will meet someone better for you.

311
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,480
I think so.

312
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,760
Well. Congratulations.

313
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,360
Thank you.

314
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,040
I will be more concentrated

315
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,920
on the competitions,

316
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,040
and I won't have much time for you.

317
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,440
Make sure you are happy.

318
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,240
If Qin Shen is bad to you,

319
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,160
you must tell me.

320
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,080
I will punch him.

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,760
OK. Practice hard for your competitions.

322
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,360
I will.

323
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,520
And I will win the championship for you.

324
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,600
I have to go.

325
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,800
Take some good rest.

326
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,760
Song Siyi.

327
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,040
Thank you.

328
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,040
There is some present

329
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,240
that I can only keep to myself forever.

330
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,040
Are you mad at me?

331
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,480
What's wrong, Qin?

332
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,080
Why do you look like a shit

333
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,160
and don't even move.

334
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,280
Go away.

335
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,808
Yuan Qian

336
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,480
It's good to have a relationship.

337
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,920
You got the chance to fight each other.

338
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,920
You mean

339
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,720
you broke the promises you made with Qin Shen.

340
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,320
He got mad and wouldn't speak to you?

341
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,160
Song Siyi just grabbed my hands

342
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,240
and pulled me out.

343
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,720
I broke two promises for that.

344
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,920
Now he doesn't text me back, doesn't answer my call,

345
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,440
and doesn't talk to me.

346
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,880
I guess he's still jealous.

347
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,120
That's a bit troublesome.

348
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,760
No one knows

349
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,040
what's in his mind.

350
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,360
I made the mistake.

351
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,720
But, Luo Xinxin, you have to help me out.

352
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,400
How to coax him to forgive me?

353
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,000
Let me think.

354
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,400
Basically,

355
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,840
he is just jealous, angry,

356
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,240
and can't swallow his pride.

357
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,680
And you

358
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,040
can just be nice, say something sweet,

359
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,000
and act cute.

360
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,400
This is the so-called "cute gesture for peace".

361
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
Round one.

362
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,600
You are done? Are you tired?

363
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,480
Drink some water.

364
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,560
Are you hungry?

365
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,320
Let's go grab something to eat.

366
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,680
What do you want to eat?

367
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Hot pot, barbecue, spicy hot pot,

368
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,520
or hamburger.

369
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,680
Whatever. I'll go to the cafeteria.

370
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,840
Let's eat,

371
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,720
What's wrong?

372
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,800
"Have vinegar" in Chinese pop culture means "being jealous".
Have more if you want.

373
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,840
You won't talk to me forever?

374
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,320
He's talking to me!

375
00:28:26,224 --> 00:28:27,640
I want to be alone. I'm not here.

376
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:28,504
I'm sorry.
I want to be alone. I'm not here.

377
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
You know how to play memes.

378
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,544
It won't work.
I'm still mad.

379
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,680
You want to play?

380
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,560
Fine. Let's play.

381
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,960
It's true that

382
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,400
people in love are stupid.

383
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,360
Where is the Qin that was so cool?

384
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,040
My god.

385
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,360
Please give him back to us.

386
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,640
If being sour can soothe you

387
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,160
who got no girl,

388
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,760
please continue.

389
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,520
If having a relationship will

390
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,800
turn a person from normal to dumb,

391
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,320
I can stay away from girls for my whole life.

392
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,040
I think he is sick now because of

393
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,960
Yuan Qian's coaxing.

394
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
Every now and then,

395
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,360
a man needs his girlfriend to coax him.

396
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,440
The life won't be complete

397
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,120
without such experience.

398
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,360
Like your life

399
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,040
with no girls.

400
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,480
Yuan Qian.

401
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,960
Qin Shen still won't talk to you?

402
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Tell me about it.

403
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,480
I have run out of all my talents

404
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,520
for sending memes to him the whole afternoon.

405
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,640
Did he forgive you or not?

406
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,920
No.

407
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,320
He's taking his time.

408
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,880
It's OK.

409
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,392
Let's start plan B tomorrow.

410
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,056
Sunflower Manual
Let's start plan B tomorrow.

411
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:10,360
Let's start plan B tomorrow.

412
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,800
"The power of tenderness".

413
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,360
Round two.

414
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,200
Let me help you.

415
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
Let me wipe the sweat off for you.

416
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,120
Step two, get him with tears.

417
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,040
Just cry.

418
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,960
Crocodile tears.

419
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,720
You will never speak to me again?

420
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,080
Here. Drink some water.

421
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Qin.

422
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,760
No offense,

423
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920
but you got a heart of stone.

424
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,720
She came to see you playing,

425
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
watched over your bag, and sent you water.

426
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,600
It's a lot.

427
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
And you still don't feel anything?

428
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,160
You deserve to be single.

429
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
I can drink for him.

430
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
I'm thirsty now.

431
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,480
Come on. Let's go.

432
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,720
Come on.

433
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:24,960
Again.

434
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
I quit. I quit.

435
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,040
Qin.

436
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,440
Are you on dope?

437
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,040
Is he OK?

438
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,360
Well.

439
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm Qin Shen's girlfriend.

440
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,840
You?

441
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,360
Qin.

442
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,600
You were cold to your girlfriend.

443
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,880
I felt sorry for her and drank the water she sent.

444
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,200
How come I'm the miserable one?

445
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,240
Have you broken the ice?

446
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,840
A little of it.

447
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,400
Basically the same as none of it.

448
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,520
How's that?

449
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,000
He texts me,

450
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,560
answers my call, talks to me,

451
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,000
and waits for me to have meals.

452
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,960
But he just has that long face

453
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,360
and it makes me want to punch him.

454
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,600
Hold it.

455
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,520
The victory is in sight.

456
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,960
Your tricks didn't work.

457
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,120
He seems to enjoy it

458
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,360
and doesn't want to make up with me.

459
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,880
We can implement plan C.

460
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,200
Act like you're hurt

461
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,280
to let him coax you in return.

462
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,680
If this won't work,

463
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,880
you can break up with him.

464
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,680
Game over.

465
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,200
It's almost the time.

466
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
Let's go for a meal.

467
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,960
Good idea. Good idea.

468
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,840
Alright, everyone.

469
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,840
What happened?

470
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,040
Wait.

471
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,040
Are you alright?

472
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
Did I say something wrong?

473
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,000
Do I owe you money?

474
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,520
So what happened to you?

475
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm fine.

476
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,520
Bye.

477
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,040
This isn't right.

478
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,040
Why are you like this?

479
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,200
Let me go.

480
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,920
I have to go back to check on Yuan Qian.

481
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,320
I don't know why,

482
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,720
but she's been having headache

483
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,360
and chest pain

484
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,200
during these days.

485
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,960
What's wrong with her?

486
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,920
I don't know.

487
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,560
She said her chest hurts in the morning.

488
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,760
But I don't know

489
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,360
if she's gone to the hospital as I told her.

490
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,520
Will it be heart attack?

491
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,360
Heart attack?

492
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,480
Yuan Qian. Yuan Qian.

493
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,400
Qin Shen was racing to your place.

494
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,000
What did you tell him?

495
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,160
I told him you had a heart attack,

496
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,240
and his face turned green.

497
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,680
You're so exaggerating.

498
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,400
He will just pull me into the ambulance.

499
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,560
It's OK.

500
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,360
You can make it clear to him,

501
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,840
right?

502
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,840
Come on. Get ready.

503
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,720
Alright. That's it.

504
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,040
Bye.

505
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,040
I look too good

506
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,320
to be a patient.

507
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,160
Where are you now?

508
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,680
I'm...

509
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,920
I'm in the dormitory.

510
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,160
Are you still feeling unwell?

511
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I'll see you upstairs.

512
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,560
It's OK.

513
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,360
I'll see you downstairs.

514
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,920
Don't go anywhere.

515
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Coming!

516
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,280
I told the concierge I wanted to check on you.

517
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Luo Xinxin told me you have a chest pain.

518
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,240
No. No.

519
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,200
I just have a period pain.

520
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,080
Don't you feel stuffy or chest pain?

521
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,960
I don't.

522
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,160
Nor headache?

523
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,280
No.

524
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,160
It's jut my belly.

525
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,200
It hurts every month.

526
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,160
Isn't it just the middle of the month?

527
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,400
Do you have the regular menstruation?

528
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,480
Yes.

529
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,920
Period pain could be serious.

530
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,880
Let's go to the hospital.

531
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,440
No need!

532
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,600
See the doctor

533
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,480
and cure your chest pain by the way.

534
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,520
No. No. No.

535
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,520
Why is the prescription so long?

536
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,640
It will work the same if I work out more

537
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,600
and have some good rest.

538
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,200
I don't need them.

539
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,520
Follow the doctor's advice.

540
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,640
It's so expensive.

541
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,400
I can pass that.

542
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,040
It'll work the same if I eat healthier.

543
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,400
Take as directed.

544
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,400
Yuan Qian.

545
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,320
Qin Shen is asking you to take the medicine.

546
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,160
I won't go.

547
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,720
Didn't you want to make up with him?

548
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,920
Isn't it a good thing that he cares about you now?

549
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,520
In that case, I prefer not making up with him forever.

550
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,800
Luo Xinxin. You have no idea.

551
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,960
He is a devil.

552
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,360
He pushed me to take it

553
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,160
three times a day.

554
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,360
And I have to take every drop of it.

555
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,520
Now I feel bitter every time I breathe.

556
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,880
That means he cares about you.

557
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,800
Says you.

558
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,040
It's all your idea.

559
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,200
I took the ECG, and Color Doppler test.

560
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,200
They drew 2 tubes of my blood.

561
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,080
Look, there is still a bruise on my arm.

562
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,760
There's nothing I can do.

563
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:38,744
Qin Shen

564
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,360
Tell him his girlfriend fainted for the pain

565
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,640
and can't go down and take the medicine.

566
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,600
He will come up and drag you to the hospital.

567
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,000
Hello, Qin Shen.

568
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
This is Xinxin.

569
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,840
Yuan Qian?

570
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,600
She's sleeping.

571
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,480
I will tell her to take it after she wakes up.

572
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,560
OK. Bye.

573
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,120
What did he say?

574
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
Tell you to take the medicine.

575
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,160
Qin Shen asked me to give you this.

576
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,200
He said you can take one if the medicine is too bitter.

577
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,880
He's finally doing something right.

578
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,640
Alright. I can make peace with him again.

579
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,200
Stop it.

580
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,640
Yuan Qian.

581
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,240
Where's Qin Shen?

582
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,040
He's out, maybe.

583
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,520
Yuan Qian.

584
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,200
Can you guys keep it low-key

585
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,200
and don't be so cruel on us who are not taken yet?

586
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,200
What's wrong?

587
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,880
Don't you know?

588
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,480
We have to endure him every day.

589
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
He was always laughing like a fool.

590
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,040
Since he got you,

591
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,640
he started to disdain us and judge us

592
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,320
for not having a date.

593
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,960
What's so good about having a girlfriend?

594
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,320
Right.

595
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,200
He is happy every day?

596
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,280
Yeah.

597
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,640
He is so happy.

598
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,400
Has he ever been upset

599
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,600
or sad?

600
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,480
Yes.

601
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,120
When he was at outs with you,

602
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,600
he was quite devastated.

603
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,560
But,

604
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,840
he acted like he was so in love

605
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,120
later on.

606
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,760
He just stared at his phone and like...

607
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,560
No. He was like...

608
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Qin Shen! Just you wait!

609
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:40,960
What...

610
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:41,840
What's wrong

611
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,040
with him?

612
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:47,920
It's nothing.

613
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
We mess it up.

614
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,320
Are we in trouble?
