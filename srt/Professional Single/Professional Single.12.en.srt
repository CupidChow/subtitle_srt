1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 12

3
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,200
Are you OK?

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Keep it up.

5
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
You need to grow higher,

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,840
or you'll be our burden.

7
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,520
How could you say that?

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,320
Look at Qin and me,

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,920
am I right?

10
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,160
Essence is made from concentrate.

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,640
Didn't sleep well?

12
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,600
I thought about it thoroughly last night.

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,120
What happened between us

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,120
wasn't the arrangement of fate.

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,400
You may have missed your chance

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,720
and can't get it back,

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,880
but I still have a chance.

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,560
I can change my fate.

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,146
That's what you reckon?

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,480
Right.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,720
Am I wrong?

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,880
You're really pig-headed.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
What?

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,280
Why did you make personal attack?

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,200
Yuan Qian.

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,120
Qin Shen.

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,520
Why didn't you come to the party yesterday?

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,280
You should've been the stars of it.

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,080
I was tied up yesterday.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,480
Yuan Qian,

31
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
just tell me

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
if you are busy next time.

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,240
I wasn't familiar with them,

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,000
I wouldn't have gone there

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,520
if I have known you weren't show up.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,640
I was forced to drink too much.

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,200
It was horrible!

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,240
Well...

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,120
It has nothing to do

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
with her.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,520
I didn't mean that.

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,440
It sounds like that to me.

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
The teacher's coming.

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Time for class.

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,040
You did that to cover up what happened last night,

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,160
or

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,320
to protect me?

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
Take a guess.

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,120
How could I get it?

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,000
What's the hurry?

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,280
Yuan Qian,

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,920
I know you really want to help me,

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,520
and I appreciate that.

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,520
But I can't

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,040
take the money.

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
It's for your mother,

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
not for you.

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
What's the difference

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,920
between giving it to her or me?

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,480
You don't have to do this,

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I have money.

62
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,320
Keep it for yourself.

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,720
I'm lending it to you,

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
not giving it to you,

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
you'll give it back with interests.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,640
Then I have another reason to reject it.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Why should I live with a loan

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,800
when I'm not short of money?

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,720
Take it,

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
keep it safe.

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,240
By the way,

72
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
your new electives are all on weekends,

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,000
so is the coming orienteering.

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,280
You now have the money,

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,840
so stop doing your part-time job

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,360
and concentrate on your classes.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Are you sure you don't need it?

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm sure.

79
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,840
Trust me.

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,960
Stop pulling my hair!

81
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,360
See you.

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Be a good student.

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
Bye.

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Mom,

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,640
did you sell your grandpa's watch?

86
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,920
Sorry, mom.

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm sure

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
I can redeem the watch

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,040
when I get the prize money

90
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,960
after the competition.

91
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,040
It was my fault,

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,600
I shouldn't have accepted Yuan Qian's money.

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
You're friends,

94
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,360
it would hurt your pride

95
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
if we use her money.

96
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
I didn't mean that,

97
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
I have confident in myself,

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,120
I'll win the competition.

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,600
It was all my fault.

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,560
It's OK to sold the watch,

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
I just feel so bad

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,320
that I can't help you.

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
If I wasn't so capricious

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,200
to kept you with me...

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,360
No!

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,680
Mom,

107
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,200
thank you for always supporting my dream.

108
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Mom,

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,920
I miss your Braised Spare Ribs in Brown Sauce,

110
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,680
can I have it tonight?

111
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,080
Then I'll come home tonight.

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,760
OK.

113
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,920
OK.

114
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,760
So it's settled.

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,800
Bye.

116
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
I still remember we were carefree and happy

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,040
when we were in high school.

118
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Sometimes I really hope

119
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,640
nothing changes when I wake up,

120
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,320
and we're still in high school.

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,000
Right.

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,320
But there's no going back.

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,960
There is,

124
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
if we want to.

125
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,120
Will you come to my birthday tonight?

126
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,320
Will Qin Shen come too?

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
You didn't invite him?

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640
I wanted to,

129
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
but I'm afraid he won't come.

130
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,800
Do you mind if I invite him?

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
How could it be?

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
It's fine.

133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
We can celebrate together.

134
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,760
Isn't it?

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,280
That's what I'm thinking about.

136
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,840
We can have a good talk

137
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,040
by this chance

138
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,560
to resolve our misunderstandings.

139
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,760
But I don't know what to do

140
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
if he refused me,

141
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,480
could you invite him for me?

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
That's out of my capability.

143
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,120
But...

144
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,920
But what?

145
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,080
Qin Shen's close to Yuan Qian lately.

146
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,280
If we couldn't find Qin Shen during activities,

147
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
we'd look for Yuan Qian.

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,840
If Yuan Qian show up,

149
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,880
Qin Shen will come, too.

150
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,280
Why don't you invite Yuan Qian then?

151
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
You mean Qin Shen likes Yuan Qian?

152
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,560
I'm not sure.

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,840
You have to ask Qin Shen.

154
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,560
I see.

155
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Hey, Yuan Qian,

156
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,760
I heard you've quit the job.

157
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,160
I got too many classes recently,

158
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,960
I don't have time for it.

159
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,840
I see.

160
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,920
By the way,

161
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,640
have you lost a book on oil painting

162
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,920
in the training school?

163
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,600
I saw the stamp of our library on its back.

164
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,640
Right, I was wondering where it is,

165
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,480
so I've lost it there.

166
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
I knew it's yours,

167
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,920
so I've brought it back.

168
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,440
Ling Wei, are you in the dorm now?

169
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,720
I'll go for it

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,680
because it'll expire tomorrow.

171
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,840
I... I'm outside now.

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
It's fine, I'll go tonight.

173
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,560
Tomorrow's also fine.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
I won't go back tonight,

175
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,800
and I don't know when will I tomorrow.

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
Can you come out to take it?

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,880
OK, where should I find you?

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,880
Windsor KTV.

179
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
Seven o'clock tonight.

180
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
OK, see you tonight.

181
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Why's she in a KTV?

182
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Qin Shen,

183
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
my classmates will come

184
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,520
to celebrate my birthday tonight.

185
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,680
Why don't you come to?

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,120
I'm busy.

187
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,720
Yuan Qian will come, too.

188
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,640
What're you planning for?

189
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,040
Do you think

190
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,600
there's a plan in everything I do?

191
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,080
Yuan Qian is my friend,

192
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,960
I just want to celebrate my birthday with her.

193
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
Am I wrong?

194
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,160
Seven o'clock tonight.

195
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,080
Windsor KTV.

196
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,560
You had dinner?

197
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,120
Yes.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
What?

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,240
I mean supper.

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,360
You're inviting me for a supper?

201
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,320
It's two o'clock, how could we have it now?

202
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,840
Shall we have supper together?

203
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,720
I can't.

204
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm engaged tonight.

205
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,760
Maybe tomorrow?

206
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,840
Engaged in what?

207
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,240
You're so interested in me suddenly,

208
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,000
are you...

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,120
See you.

210
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,640
Order as you like, make yourselves at home.

211
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm putting on weight.

212
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,520
You haven't changed a little bit.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're flattering me.

214
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,760
No,

215
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,320
you're as cute as before.

216
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,920
Yuan Qian.

217
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,880
Come here.

218
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm here for the book.

219
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,880
I'll give you later, come on in.

220
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,240
Ling Wei,

221
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,680
it's your birthday today?

222
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm sorry, I didn't know!

223
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
I didn't bring you a gift.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to make a cost.

225
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
I'm so happy you're here.

226
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,320
Have a seat.

227
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,280
I'll meet the others.

228
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,200
OK, I won't bother you.

229
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,160
Yuan Qian!

230
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,280
Yuan Qian!

231
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,360
Yuan Qian!

232
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,000
Jia Sicheng?

233
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
Why're you here?

234
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,080
This way, here's a room for you.

235
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,960
Come on!

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,720
Hold on.

237
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
Excuse me.

238
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,880
Thank you.

239
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
Sit here.

240
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,240
I don't think it's proper.

241
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Really? Are you sure?

242
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,960
I've no idea.

243
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,960
It's fine.

244
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,880
I'll sit here.

245
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,960
It's fine.

246
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,920
Sit there if there's a room.

247
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
Next time when you dragging me,

248
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,160
could you tell yourself this's a person, not a sack?

249
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Sorry.

250
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,600
Why're you here?

251
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,320
Why're you here?

252
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,720
Haven't I told you I'm engaged?

253
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,800
Come on, cheers!

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Cheers!

255
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,760
Take whatever you like,

256
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
it's a treatment for accompanying me.

257
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,600
Then I should thank you.

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,760
By the way,

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
why're you here?

260
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,360
Qin Shen, Ling Wei and I

261
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
were classmates in high school.

262
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,920
You're their classmates, too?

263
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,600
Yes.

264
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,960
I thought you'd be surprised

265
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
that they were classmates.

266
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,200
No.

267
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,840
Ling Wei has told me about it.

268
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,920
Actually I'm pretty surprised that Qin Shen came.

269
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,400
It's normal for Qin Shen to come

270
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,320
since they were classmates.

271
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,960
I'm sure it's normal since he used to

272
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,440
care about her.

273
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,840
Yuan Qian,

274
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,720
take whatever you want.

275
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,440
Make yourself at home,

276
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,240
it's Ling Wei's treat anyway.

277
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,920
She won't change her frayed wallet

278
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,960
because it was a present from Qin Shen.

279
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,360
Qin Shen has sent Ling Wei a wallet?

280
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,200
Yes.

281
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,120
She's always taking it with her.

282
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm sure there's something between them.

283
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,920
She'd believe those words.

284
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,080
Here're snacks!

285
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,880
Take some.

286
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,560
Boys! Bottoms up!

287
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,360
Thanks.

288
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,273
Open it yourself.

289
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Have some snacks.

290
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,720
Jia Sicheng, hurry!

291
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,200
Hurry up!

292
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,680
All right.

293
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,840
Have some snacks.

294
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,200
I just want to put the card back.

295
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
I can do it, thanks.

296
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,200
There he comes.

297
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Drink it first.

298
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,880
OK.

299
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,560
Then it's Ling Wei's turn.

300
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,160
Ling Wei's turn?

301
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,160
I'll try this.

302
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,320
Here's your juice.

303
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,880
All right!

304
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,640
Ling Wei,

305
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,600
the one on your left should play Truth or Dare.

306
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,800
Then I'll ask.

307
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,720
Listen,

308
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,640
who's your favorite person?

309
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,560
My parents.

310
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,120
They don't count,

311
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,480
I mean boys.

312
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
Then

313
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
it's Xiao Jing.

314
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,520
He doesn't count either,

315
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,920
you admire him at most

316
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
since he's popular.

317
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,400
Then I've no idea,

318
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,480
maybe I don't have one.

319
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
My favorite thing is study.

320
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,160
Yuan Qian, can you be serious?

321
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Stop beating around the bush!

322
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,720
OK, let her be.

323
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,040
Maybe she doesn't want to say

324
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
because he's here.

325
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,120
She'll be embarrassed to do so.

326
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,480
Who's this guy here?

327
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,840
Maybe it's me!

328
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,920
Forget it, give me a break!

329
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
Actually I think it's normal

330
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,400
to have no one to like.

331
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,520
Let's go on.

332
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,160
OK, the next is Dai Yaqing.

333
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,160
My turn?

334
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes.

335
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,120
Let's go.

336
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,440
Let's go.

337
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,240
OK.

338
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,480
All shall drink up.

339
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,080
Come on!

340
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,080
I told you I'm not planning for anything!

341
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,320
Qin Shen,

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,800
you never came to my birthday party before.

343
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,720
If I didn't tell you Yuan Qian would come,

344
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,560
you'd never be here!

345
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,840
I know you're here for her,

346
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,760
but why're you so concerned?

347
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,960
You think I'll eat her alive?

348
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,440
You know it clearly

349
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,240
what you're planning for.

350
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,240
What can I do to win your trust?

351
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,280
Like I told you, I'm not planning for anything!

352
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,440
I like Yuan Qian,

353
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
I'm taking her as my friend.

354
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,880
I just want her

355
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,360
to join my birthday party!

356
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,760
I just want

357
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
to make up with you

358
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,840
by inviting you here.

359
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,560
We don't have to be enemies.

360
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,280
Can't we even be friends

361
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,000
if we can't be a couple?

362
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,680
You should leave Yuan Qian alone,

363
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,880
she's not good at your games.

364
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,880
Have this.

365
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,080
Thanks.

366
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,240
All right.

367
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,000
Hi,

368
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,560
I'm leaving.

369
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,240
Come on!

370
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,360
You should drink less.

371
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,320
Ling Wei,

372
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,760
it's late, I should go back.

373
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
Yuan Qian.

374
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,560
Yuan Qian.

375
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,960
Yuan Qian, I'm sorry.

376
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,640
I lied to you.

377
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,000
Do you know it?

378
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,880
I still like him.

379
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,040
I've been liking him for three years.

380
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,040
I've lost myself in this affection.

381
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,600
I...

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,120
I really afraid

383
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,280
that you'll say

384
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,120
you like him, too.

385
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,240
But

386
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,280
I... I know...

387
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,920
I know I should wish you two happy.

388
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,320
But I really can't do it.

389
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,040
Why wouldn't he look into my eyes?

390
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,760
Why did he always wrong me?

391
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Did I do anything wrong?

392
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,320
Yuan Qian.

393
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,000
Yuan Qian.

394
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Could you tell me

395
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,240
what should I do

396
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,720
to make him like me?

397
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,240
Dai Yaqing!

398
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Ling Wei, let Dai Yaqing take you back.

399
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,600
Have a good rest, OK?

400
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,480
She's so drunk?

401
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,320
I'll handle this.

402
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,080
She's yours.

403
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,360
You can go back.

404
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,080
Are you alright?

405
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,160
Let's go back, OK?

406
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,920
I won't go back.

407
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,560
I don't want to.

408
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,600
What?

409
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,080
Nothing.

410
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,040
Split it out.

411
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,120
Have you

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
being with Lin Wei before?

413
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,840
No.

414
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,680
Then did she like you so much

415
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,200
and chased you for long?

416
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,200
Does that matter you?

417
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,320
No.

418
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,040
Then why're you asking?

419
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,160
I...

420
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
I'm just curious.

421
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
You know it.

422
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,280
He's so changeable,

423
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,760
what's in his mind?

424
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
He has nothing else to do?

425
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,360
Whatever!

426
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,320
I'll be a fool if I talk to him!

427
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,940
Are you asleep?

428
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:27,893
No, you?

429
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,480
No, not decent.

430
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,080
Seems like a perfunctory answer.

431
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,560
What if he won't reply?

432
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,480
I am.

433
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
Sorry to bother you.

434
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
That's it?

435
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Forget it,

436
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,960
I shouldn't have expectations on a straight man!

437
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Good night!

438
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,920
He's not totally naive.

439
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,560
What're you doing now?

440
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,760
Sleeping?

441
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,840
So early?

442
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,360
I'm too tired today

443
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,120
and I had some beer.

444
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,560
Why did you drink?

445
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,320
It's Ling Wei's birthday.

446
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,720
By the way,

447
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,640
I've got good news for you.

448
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,600
Have a guess?

449
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,960
I'm sleeping, let's talk tomorrow.

450
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,080
I’m gonna let you go.

451
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,920
Song Siyi is so annoying!

452
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,120
So childish!

453
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,520
Where's Song?

454
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,800
I'll go find him.

455
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,040
All right,

456
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,720
thank you for achieving

457
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,160
such a good result,

458
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,240
I'll propose a toast for you on behalf of the company.

459
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,960
Come on.

460
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,800
Cheers.

461
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,280
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

462
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,920
Talking to your mother?

463
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
The company wants to know

464
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,160
the date you go back.

465
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,120
Tomorrow then.

466
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,240
Tomorrow?

467
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
There's only one early flight tomorrow!

468
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,120
It's fine.

469
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,680
I'll take that early flight.

470
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,320
Won't you sleep?

471
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,280
It'll be dawn when we go back!

472
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,680
I really want to see someone right now,

473
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,200
though she's ungrateful.

474
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,920
Part-time sister?

475
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,920
Hurry, we're all waiting for you.

476
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,840
Qin!

477
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,560
Come here!

478
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,920
Your rival in love is awesome!

479
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,320
Congratulations on Song Siyi

480
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,800
for winning the sculling!

481
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,720
It's unexpected

482
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
that Song Siyi could win this time,

483
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,880
the audience there went crazy!

484
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,880
No just them,

485
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,560
so will the school leaders!

486
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,000
First, I want to thank my coach and teammates,

487
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
then,

488
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,360
I want to thank a girl.

489
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
Yuan Qian!

490
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,640
Get down here! Big news!

491
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,200
Come here, all of you!

492
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
Check this out!

493
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,240
What's the fuss?

494
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Come on!

495
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,960
She even did part-time job

496
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,840
when she was free.

497
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,160
Come on.

498
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,080
Without her,

499
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,240
I don't think I can achieve this result.

500
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,560
What's your relationship?

501
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,960
She's your girlfriend?

502
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,680
Tell us, Mr. Song!

503
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,920
What's your relationship?

504
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,040
Yes, tell us!

505
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,360
She's

506
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,240
a very special person to me.

507
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,240
Mr. Song,

508
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,160
did you attend

509
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,760
this competition for her?

510
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,120
Yuan Qian?

511
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,360
Sculling's boring, forget it.

512
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,400
He's ordinary.

513
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,000
Just an ordinary guy.

514
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,640
Qin?

515
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,000
Yuan Qian!

516
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,360
You're the one he was speaking of!

517
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,280
Right?

518
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,040
Oh, no!

519
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,320
I'll change my side.

520
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,320
Song Siyi, you're so romantic!

521
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,840
He's purely expressing his love!

522
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
Could you think for my clothes?

523
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,960
Qin Shen, I'm sorry.

524
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm standing on Song's side now.

525
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,840
What's the big deal?

526
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,080
Isn't it just a live love-expressing spot?

527
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,880
Choose Song Siyi, I back you up!

528
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,640
What're you talking about?

529
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,920
We're good friends

530
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,400
since childhood!

531
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,880
This is normal.

532
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,920
You've grown up together!

533
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,480
That's an innocent relation.

534
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:46,000
I even saw him wearing open-backed pants then,

535
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,280
we're just like relatives!

536
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,200
But I didn't expect he'd win,

537
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
that's awesome.

538
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,680
Qin,

539
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,440
is it Yuan Qian your rival in love referred to?

540
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,280
She has been active in part-time job.

541
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,480
Didn't she work as

542
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,800
a teacher with you?

543
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,160
Why should I care?

544
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,040
Go on.

545
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,640
You'll be regret

546
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,600
when she's with your rival.

547
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,520
Nature’s calling.

548
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,080
Don't guess if you don't want to,

549
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,520
I'll tell you now.

550
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,120
I...

551
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,640
I've seen your interview.

552
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,480
Congratulations! Champion!

553
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Could you stop saying

554
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,800
such things to set me up?

555
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm afraid I'll be killed by your girl fans!

556
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,240
Sorry!

557
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,760
The subscriber you dialed is busy now...

558
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,640
Come on, pick it up.

559
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,680
Why did he call me?

560
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,160
Sorry!

561
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,360
The subscriber you dialed is busy now,

562
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,960
please redial later. Sorry...

563
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,160
Let me take this.

564
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,960
Thanks.

565
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,320
Can I ask you something?

566
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,040
What?

567
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,880
Song Siyi, the guy from the Sports Department,

568
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,720
did he mean Yuan Qian in the interview?

569
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,760
I knew you were planning something

570
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,400
when you helped me!

571
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,360
Did he?

572
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,600
Yes.

573
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,680
I knew it!

574
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,360
Song Siyi was so cool!

575
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,760
The girls of our room

576
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,320
were so excited that we yelled

577
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,760
when we were watching his game video yesterday.

578
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,520
We almost became his fans.

579
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,880
To think you're a classmate of Qin!

580
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Is that Song prettier than Qin?

581
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,880
Song Siyi's pretty, OK?

582
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
The most important thing is

583
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,120
Song Siyi has an advantage

584
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,840
which Qin Shen doesn't have at all.

585
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,840
Impossible!

586
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:26,913
Our Qin has every advantages

587
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,840
Song Siyi possesses!

588
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,200
Absolutely impossible!

589
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,520
Activeness!

590
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,600
Ac...

591
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,960
activeness?

592
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,000
Girls are easy to chase.

593
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,680
Guys need to constantly

594
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,440
draw their attention.

595
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,280
Being pretty alone won't work.

596
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,000
Speaking of drawing attention,

597
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,000
our Qin

598
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,600
draws more than that Song!

599
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,600
It's hard for him to see Yuan Qian.

600
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,560
But our Qin

601
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,600
can show up in front of her every day.

602
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,760
You're all brawn and no brains!

603
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,960
It's really boring

604
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,640
to talk gossips with you!

605
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,760
Stop beating me!

606
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,960
What're you doing?

607
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,080
Why're you on my seat?

608
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,960
I've got more mud,

609
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,880
here's some for you.

610
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,120
Thank you, bro.

611
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,120
I've learned something

612
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,040
when I'm talking to her.

613
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,160
I think she has the point.

614
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,680
You should be more active.

615
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,000
You need the mud?

616
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,040
I'm good.

617
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,920
This guy's really hopeless.

618
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,080
What're you doing?

619
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Homework.

620
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,800
I mean what're you making?

621
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Two swans rubbing their necks.

622
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,160
Now the mud cake's ready,

623
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,160
so are the paper fillers.

624
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,680
Pack the cake with paper.

625
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,280
Mind the shape,

626
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,640
then bend the iron wire into the shape of swan necks.

627
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,080
Qin Shen,

628
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,040
I don't have to be No.1.

629
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,440
Why don't you do yours now,

630
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,720
I'll ask you if I have any questions.

631
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,640
You're giving me

632
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,320
enormous pressure by standing here.

633
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,440
How could I make a good work then?

634
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,200
You're giving me more pressure

635
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,200
than Prof. Jin.

636
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,960
Girls are easy to chase.

637
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
Guys need to constantly

638
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,360
draw their attention.

639
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,320
Being pretty alone won't work.

640
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,400
Junk science!

641
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,400
Wait a moment.

642
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,240
You're not together yet,

643
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,160
why're you going to separate?

644
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,560
The neck won't stand,

645
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,440
I did it like Qin Shen said.

646
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,160
Hello?

647
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,040
Song Siyi,

648
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,440
what's up?

649
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,880
Relax,

650
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,600
I won't forget your treat.

651
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,040
Wait, I'll call you later.

652
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,040
I've got something to do.

653
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,880
Wait!

654
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Wait!

655
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,720
My...

656
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,760
my male swan's neck

657
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,920
just won't stand.

658
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,520
Can you help me?

659
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,720
I make it as what you told me.

660
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,000
This's swans rubbing their necks,

661
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,440
but this one won't stand.

662
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,840
You've used wrong type of wire.

663
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,720
It's too thin to hold the neck.

664
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,640
What shall I do?

665
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,240
Don't tell me I have to remake it.

666
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,640
You may if you have time.

667
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,560
I'm so busy lately,

668
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,960
how could this happen to me?

669
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,480
I...

670
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,840
You took part-time jobs for Song Siyi?

671
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Well,

672
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,760
something happened to him recently.

673
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,760
I have to help him.

674
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,800
You're friends since childhood?

675
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,400
No.

676
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,520
Well, sort of.

677
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,840
We grew up together.

678
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,280
You quite cares about him.

679
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,080
We're good friends,

680
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,120
we should help each other.

681
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,000
Is that so?

682
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,680
Easy!

683
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,400
You!

684
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,920
It's broken!

685
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
This...

686
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,880
I want to make swans rubbing necks,

687
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,160
now it looks like a Spiced Duck Neck!

688
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,440
Sorry, I was trying too hard.

689
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,480
What shall I do?

690
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,400
I have to hand in it this afternoon!

691
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,760
Rubbing necks has another meaning: mating.

692
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,240
It's indecent.

693
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,040
Why don't you call it The Death of Swan?

694
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,040
It's touching and beautiful, and elegant.

695
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,400
They're same.

696
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,720
In which way?

697
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,440
Aren't they?

698
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,800
Take your hands away.

699
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,280
What's this?

700
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,640
Will Prof. Jin think

701
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
I'm too perfunctory?

702
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,000
Yuan Qian,

703
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,400
do you think he won't kick your ass?

704
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,080
What's this?

705
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,360
Putting a dead swan with a living one?

706
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,720
This's two swans rubbing necks!

707
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,920
Yuan Qian,

708
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,440
you may insult my grade,

709
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,600
but you can't insult my eye sight!

710
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,400
I've passed the English test

711
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,160
by peeping multiple-choice questions

712
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,200
with these sharp eyes!

713
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
I...

714
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,880
Professor!

715
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,200
We're ready!

716
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,880
Please check these.

717
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,840
I think it's hard to see

718
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,360
this kind of immature work

719
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,360
with a good shape.

720
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,320
I can tell

721
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,800
No.1 will be Qin again,

722
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,840
no surprise.

723
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Tell me.

724
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,360
Why did you break my swan's neck?

725
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,080
Now one's dead and one's alive,

726
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,480
it's ridiculous!

727
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,160
Didn't I tell you?

728
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,200
Knock it off!

729
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,480
That's absurd.

730
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,840
Who knows rubbing necks means mating?

731
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,440
Besides, even it means mating,

732
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,240
it's noble

733
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
because it can produce lives.

734
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,920
I saw it from the prospect of art.

735
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
Yuan Qian, come here!

736
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,880
Is your swan died?

737
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,600
It... it...

738
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,880
Nice work, you've made progress.

739
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,200
The Death of Swan.

740
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,560
Swans are strictly monogamous.

741
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,680
If one dies,

742
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,920
another will fast

743
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,360
to die for its lover.

744
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,280
Yuan Qian

745
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
has grabbed this emotion

746
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,520
to create the work.

747
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,800
It's striking.

748
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,680
It has more pathos

749
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,920
than normal rubbing necks.

750
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,240
Good!

751
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,480
Very good!

752
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
What's that expression?

753
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,640
Did I explain it wrong?

754
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,480
Right!

755
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,280
Quite right!

756
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,240
That's what I'm thinking about!

757
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Very good,

758
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,840
good job.

759
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,640
Who made this pig?

760
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,520
Me.

761
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,800
You made it for bakery?

762
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
No.

763
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,080
Isn't it good?

764
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,440
Look at its smooth skin.

765
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,960
Smooth skin.
