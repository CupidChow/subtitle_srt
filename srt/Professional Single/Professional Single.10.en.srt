1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 10

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,880
Yuan Qian.

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,640
What's up?

5
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,440
How are you recently?

6
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,320
Good, very good.

7
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,680
Are you happy these days?

8
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
Very happy.

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,520
You...

10
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
Bro, talk the turkey.

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,440
Yuan Qian,

12
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,200
do you have a boyfriend?

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
Is he Qin Shen?

14
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
How's that possible? Of course not.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,760
I see.

16
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,560
That's good.

17
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
I have to attend the training. I'm leaving now.

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,240
Bye bye.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
You... why do you walk like a ghost?

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920
You're in the way.

21
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,240
What's wrong with him?

22
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
He's warm or cold

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
from time to time.

24
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,640
Pei Mei Art School?

25
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,360
Teach painting?

26
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,320
Qin, now you're doing this kind of part-time job?

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,085
Will you die if you don't peep me?

28
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,560
In all honesty, the duck leg can testify for me.

29
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,920
I looked at it squarely and aboveboard.

30
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,160
You want to do a part-time job?

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,720
It's good that you're busy.

32
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,560
In this way, you can fall asleep at nights.

33
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,050
Otherwise you'll lost in thinking of some girl named Yuan...

34
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,770
It must because I have too much leisure time.

35
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
Pei Mei Art Training School?

36
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,080
Part-time art teacher?

37
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,920
That's good. I can have a try.

38
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,920
You want to find a part-time job again?

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
Do you lack money to this extent?

40
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,160
I was expelled by the last employer,

41
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,680
so I can find a new one.

42
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
Right.

43
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,520
Hello, Yuan Qian,

44
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
I have asked my relative.

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,760
They're short of hands.

46
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,160
You can work there directly.

47
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,720
No, thank you.

48
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,640
I've found a job.

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,440
Really? In which company?

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Pei Mei.

51
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
An art training school.

52
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,000
Pei Mei?

53
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
OK, that's good.

54
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,800
Come on.

55
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,240
You can talk to me

56
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,680
if you have any problems.

57
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,240
OK, thank you.

58
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,600
Bye bye.

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,040
You haven't sent a resume yet

60
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,800
and you're telling Ling Wei that

61
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,280
you work there.

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,120
You feel uncomfortable on she recommending you a job?

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,280
Of course.

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,320
It's most difficult to give back a favor.

65
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
It's just an art training school.

66
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,680
I can polish my resume and try to have a better performance.

67
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,160
Director Lin.

68
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,160
I think you're very suitable for our school.

69
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,200
If you can confirm it,

70
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,520
you can work here from next week.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
If it's OK,

72
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,760
I can do the admission procedure for you.

73
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,040
Thank you.

74
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
I have to confirm time.

75
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,640
But what a coconut.

76
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,080
Recently, the dean recommended a girl.

77
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
And she seems to be your schoolmate.

78
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,160
Her name is Yuan...Yuan Qian.

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,120
Do you know her?

80
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
The classtime you said is on this weekend, right?

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,320
Yes.

82
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
Then I can take the work anytime.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,640
Really?

84
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,040
OK, then you can go back and prepare for it.

85
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,800
OK, thank you, director.

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,880
OK, then I won't see you off.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,320
Good bye.

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,920
Bye bye.

89
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,080
Here, here.

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,840
Take a seat.

91
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,400
I think last time

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
I've said it clearly.

93
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,160
I know.

94
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
My family status is a little special.

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,440
I can't practice rowing any more.

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,040
This hobby is so luxurious.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
I know! I know.

98
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,720
You've told me last time.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Then are you still angry with me?

100
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,840
Actually, after the day you find our team

101
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,360
and put that clearly,

102
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,960
we all felt guilty and sorry for you.

103
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,720
We're a team.

104
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,085
Now you're facing difficulties,

105
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,040
we didn't ask you after immediately

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
and we even didn't find it out in time.

107
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,320
And we took you wrong.

108
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
Finally, we had many conflicts.

109
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,200
We felt pity that

110
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,560
you made a decision to give up rowing.

111
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,480
We felt really bad.

112
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
Don't worry. I'm true to my word.

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,085
I will raise enough maintenance money

114
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,800
to finish this competition.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,280
After this, I'll officially quit the sculling club.

116
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Don't say these now.

117
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
My father works at Peter Sports.

118
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,200
You know this, right?

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,200
Peter Sports sponsors athletes all the time.

120
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,960
And I've recommended you to them.

121
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,960
They're very interested in you.

122
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,840
So I made them an appointment today incidentally.

123
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
They're coming. It's just in time.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,555
President Zhang,

125
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,920
allow me to introduce.

126
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,840
This is President Zhang from Peter Sports.

127
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,480
This is a sculling coach.

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,800
Hello.

129
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,400
Hello.

130
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,080
Hello, my name is Song Siyi.

131
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,320
Song is really handsome.

132
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,720
President Zhang, please have a seat.

133
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
OK, OK, OK, please take a seat.

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,280
Don't make that expression.

135
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,800
I won't play hidden rules on you.

136
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,920
I really think that you're handsome

137
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,360
and is very suitable for our company. Right?

138
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,720
You're the best in your school team

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,200
and even in your whole college.

140
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,800
I've read the materials about you.

141
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
If you're cultivated well,

142
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,725
you sure will be selected into the national team.

143
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
But I...

144
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,800
I know. We've heard your problems.

145
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,120
You can't sculling with your current family status,

146
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,640
right?

147
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,960
But only if you're willing to,

148
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
we can sponsor you to continue the race.

149
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,880
To sponsor me?

150
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,240
Yes.

151
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,920
It means that Peter Sports will pay all the money

152
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,920
you need for sculling.

153
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,280
Our request is simple.

154
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,720
You should endorse us

155
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,760
and attend our activities unconditionally.

156
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,045
You should wear our clothes

157
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,520
and use our products in every competition.

158
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,000
Of course,

159
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,600
all of these is based on the fact that

160
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,520
you can really create so many values.

161
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,280
What about the criteria?

162
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,020
You should spare no pains in races.

163
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,760
Competitive sports are very cruel.

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,880
People only remember who got the first prize,

165
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,080
the gold winner.

166
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,120
So you should get the first prize

167
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,040
and win the gold medal.

168
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,600
That's all?

169
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,520
Well...

170
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,600
there are other requests

171
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,400
in the contract.

172
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,840
What kind of requests?

173
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,040
If you sign a contract with our company,

174
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
you shouldn't have a relationship or get married in ten years.

175
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,920
In every circles now,

176
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,480
people with a mould of idol can be packed out.

177
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,680
We want to pack you out

178
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,735
and send you into the market.

179
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,200
So you can't be in relationships.

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,040
Firstly, be in a relation will divert your attention.

181
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,960
Second, it'll make you lose your fans.

182
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
These can't be called as requests.

183
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,800
It's his duty.

184
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,680
I'll consider it again.

185
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,560
OK.

186
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,000
You can contact us if you've decided.

187
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,800
OK?

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,800
Thank you.

189
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
What're you doing?

190
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,400
The conditions are so good.

191
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,120
What do you need to consider?

192
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,840
I want to sign with them, but I'm unqualified.

193
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Don't you want to

194
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
step into your professional path?

195
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,920
I can't understand you this time.

196
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,160
Now we're just of 18 or 19 years old.

197
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,360
Don't fall in love for 10 years?

198
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,440
It can't be a request at all.

199
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,400
Now we have to achieve our dreams at full split

200
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
during the golden period of our body.

201
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Besides, you don't have a girlfriend.

202
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,840
Why did you hesitate?

203
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,400
What am I thinking at that moment?

204
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,600
Yes, I don't have a girlfriend.

205
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,560
Qin Shen,

206
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,800
why are you here?

207
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,080
You also have a class here?

208
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,360
You can really draw.

209
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,400
What can you learn in this young children training classes?

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,640
He means he'll teach students.

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,600
This is the thing.

212
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,320
Our school recruits another art teacher.

213
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
You should guide him.

214
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,600
I heard that you're classmates.

215
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,880
The same class, the same department and the same school.

216
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
Unexpectedly...

217
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,360
we have such a close relationship.

218
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,800
I'll go to class now.

219
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,920
I'll get you some water color pens.

220
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,955
The first place is really different.

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,160
You learn things fast.

222
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,400
But these are all we do here.

223
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Why do you a take part-time job here?

224
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
I came here by standard interview

225
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
and by proper path.

226
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,840
No, no, no.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
I didn't mean that.

228
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,680
I think you like sculpture very much.

229
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,960
You should do the projects following Professor Jin.

230
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,920
Why do you come here to teach children?

231
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,240
Professor Jin have just a few projects each year.

232
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,440
Yes.

233
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,800
I'm different from you.

234
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,120
I sent a resume after seeing the recruitment advertisement

235
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
and was enrolled without having an interview.

236
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,800
It's really easy for me.

237
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,720
I didn't ask you.

238
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,440
But I've finished.

239
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,080
Why can't you regard it as you've asked?

240
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
The new part-time male teacher today

241
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,040
is very handsome.

242
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,560
I heard only one should stay between him and the girl

243
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,720
who came here last week.

244
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,200
Be quiet. Don't let that girl hear.

245
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,840
It's OK. Nobody's here.

246
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,520
You know it again.

247
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
I heard that girl

248
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,720
made a big mistake last week.

249
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,440
Really?

250
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,920
Leaders're very unsatisfied with her personal ability.

251
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,160
So they recruited a new teacher to take her over.

252
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,400
It seems that they'll only choose one of them.

253
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,240
In my opinion,

254
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,440
the new handsome guy must stay.

255
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,690
You said so because he's handsome.

256
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,320
Can't I?

257
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,480
Love fool.

258
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,680
Why're you still here?

259
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
I'm the part-time teacher here.

260
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,120
Where can I go if I'm not here?

261
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,040
I mean why don't you go to have a meal?

262
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,440
I'm not hungry.

263
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm going to the classroom.

264
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,200
You can have a meal first.

265
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,240
There is a hosting teacher in the class during lunch time.

266
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,040
Hello.

267
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,840
You're so sweet.

268
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,040
Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.

269
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,600
Chen Boyu, remeber to fill this color out at home.

270
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,560
OK.

271
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,840
OK, thank you, teacher.

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
Bye bye.

273
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,520
You can remember the name of every child.

274
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,440
Brilliant.

275
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,240
This is a basic request of a teacher.

276
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,040
Yuan Qian,

277
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
you should learn from Qin Shen.

278
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,310
He comes here later than you.

279
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,920
But he's taking the job faster than you.

280
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
Thank you, director. I'll work harder.

281
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,040
I'm not comparable to him even as a part-time teacher.

282
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,080
It's very difficult.

283
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,520
I hope I won't lose job because of him.

284
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,780
What're you thinking about?

285
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,585
Director!

286
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm thinking about your teaching request.

287
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,320
This is the case.

288
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,760
Our school

289
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,960
invite us to have a dinner tonight.

290
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
And you new teachers...

291
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,840
Yuan Qian.

292
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,560
Ling Wei.

293
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,560
Qin Shen is a new teacher here.

294
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,800
Qin Shen, what a coconut.

295
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,600
You also doing a part-time job here?

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Look. I forget it.

297
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,280
You're classmates, right?

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well... Ling Wei,

299
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,040
when did you arrived?

300
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,560
Have you seen the president?

301
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,120
I've just visited him.

302
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,880
You know the president?

303
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,880
She doesn't only know the president.

304
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,240
Ling Wei is the president's...

305
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,200
I used to be a dancing teacher there.

306
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,840
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

307
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,105
She was a dancing teacher.

308
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
I really got a bad memory.

309
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,480
Listen.

310
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,065
Every teacher and student liked Ling Wei

311
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,760
when she was here.

312
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,520
Especially the president. He thinks highly of her.

313
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,200
No.

314
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
That's exaggerated.

315
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,680
Yuan Qian, do you get off work?

316
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
Let's have a meal together.

317
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,080
Don't!

318
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,680
School arranged a welcome party today.

319
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,800
Every new teacher will come.

320
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,840
You can know each other.

321
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,080
Mr. Lin, can I go there too?

322
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
OK. Come with us.

323
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,040
Don't just stand there.

324
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,720
Let's go.

325
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,880
Go, go, go.

326
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,680
Everyone, I have figured it out.

327
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,440
It has been three months

328
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,840
since we dined together last time.

329
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,320
Yeah.

330
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,080
You can eat whatever you want today.

331
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,120
Enjoy yourselves.

332
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,640
Don't save money for me.

333
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,825
Thank you, director.

334
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,840
This painting is good.

335
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,720
Really good.

336
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,880
Thank you.

337
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,755
You're welcome.

338
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,680
Look.

339
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,000
Look!

340
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,040
Look at his demeanor.

341
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,360
You should learn from him.

342
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,120
This is the case.

343
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,680
As the director,

344
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I suggest that we propose a toast to new peers.

345
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,475
Although they're part-time teachers,

346
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
we should treat them equally

347
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,080
without thinking of the full-time or part-time.

348
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,200
Come on, Yuan Qian.

349
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,680
Director, let me have a drink with you.

350
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,280
This is not the time to show your manner.

351
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
Girls are not suitable to drink.

352
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,720
Boys drink beers and girls can have beverages.

353
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,280
It's OK.

354
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,320
Director.

355
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,560
I can drink.

356
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:21,800
I'll drink all and you free!

357
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,960
Drink it.

358
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,600
Good, good.

359
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,960
Come on! Let me top you up!

360
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,120
Come on.

361
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,200
Let's propose a toast to them together.

362
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Here, another glass.

363
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,160
Come on! Cheers!

364
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,200
Cheers.

365
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,760
You see that? You see that?

366
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,160
Yuan Qian, you can really drink.

367
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,840
Another glass! Come on!

368
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm going to the bathroom.

369
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,640
Well...

370
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,680
Let's eat.

371
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,400
You want to go in there wearing a sour smell?

372
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Do I smell really sour?

373
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,120
Why do you flaunt if you can't drink?

374
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
I can't be worse than you.

375
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,680
Before taking the work, they told me

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,960
our class will enter a painting competition of our city.

377
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,240
They were lack of a tutor.

378
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,560
So they recruited one more.

379
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,200
So we're not of a competitive relation?

380
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,800
What are you laughing at?

381
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm laughing at your over-confidence.

382
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,000
So you're not here to replace me.

383
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,840
Everyone can replace you seeing your strength.

384
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Why are they in the same class?

385
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
Is that a coincident?

386
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,560
Ling Wei.

387
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,680
Sorry, I was startled.

388
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,800
One, two, stand up!

389
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,600
Qin Shen, give her a hand.

390
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,600
She seems to twist her ankle.

391
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,200
What about

392
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,560
you carrying her on your back?

393
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,960
No, I'm fine.

394
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
Qin Shen, please help her.

395
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,040
Well.

396
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm home.

397
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,960
Thank you...

398
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,120
for helping my business...

399
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,480
and Ling Wei's business.

400
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm too sensitive.

401
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,120
Yuan Qian,

402
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
I've never been your enemy.

403
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,320
I'm not comparable with you even if you are.

404
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,600
Then I'll go back to dorm.

405
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,280
Bye bye.

406
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,920
Let's have a talk.

407
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,040
You've been idle recently.

408
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,240
What?

409
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,600
You're bringing me and Ling Wei together?

410
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,880
What are you talking about?

411
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,160
She twisted her ankle.

412
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
You're the only boy on the spot.

413
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,360
I can't carry her

414
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,880
if you don't.

415
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,880
I don't have other purpose.

416
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
I just think that we shouldn't leave her alone there.

417
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,740
I'm not putting my fingers in others' pie.

418
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,160
Why should I match you and her together?

419
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,480
It'd better be.

420
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,280
Yuan Qian.

421
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,240
I don't like other people minding my business.

422
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,160
I don't like minding others' business either.

423
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
Yuan Qian, lend me a tissue to clean my face.

424
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,000
That one is OK.

425
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,760
It's a little dirty.

426
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,560
You're asking a whole pack of tissue!

427
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
I didn't have your returns.

428
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,240
They're quite of the same.

429
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,220
Otherwise I can return it to you after using it.

430
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,680
I refuse.

431
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,600
Really?

432
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,545
My classmate Yuan Qian,

433
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
are you so mean?

434
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,680
You didn't treat me like this before.

435
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,640
Please lend me a piece of tissue.

436
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,080
You're punished for being related to him.

437
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,560
Punished?

438
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,480
Did I offend you?

439
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,360
Qin offended you?

440
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,320
Yuan Qian.

441
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,840
Ling Wei, you're here.

442
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm looking for Yuan Qian.

443
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,280
Yuan Qian, thank you last night.

444
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,480
I bought you some snacks to express my thanks

445
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,440
Is your foot alright?

446
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,640
Yeah.

447
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,120
Actually, it's not that serious.

448
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,200
It just hurt at that time.

449
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,640
I don't know what you like to eat,

450
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,680
so I just bought them according to my love.

451
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,360
No gains without pains.

452
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,000
Qin Shen carried you yesterday.

453
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
You should thank him.

454
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
You should communicate directly.

455
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,560
I dare not to be in the middle of you.

456
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,000
Take them away.

457
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
What's wrong with you today?

458
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,520
Without any resason,

459
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,640
you're just like two cannons.

460
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,400
What are you doing?

461
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,320
I'm not.

462
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,000
You quarreled because of me?

463
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,840
No, no! Not at all.

464
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,680
If you both don't want it, I'll take them.

465
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,480
Is your foot alright?

466
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,360
It's OK. Thank you.

467
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,535
Thank you for your snacks.

468
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,720
Then I'm leaving.

469
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,920
I'll send you off.

470
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,040
Don't touch them.

471
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,480
Here.

472
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,600
Ling Wei.

473
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
I arrived earlier, so I've ordered for you.

474
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,200
I remember you like sugar-free Americano,

475
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,760
right?

476
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,440
Thank you.

477
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,480
You are quite strange.

478
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,240
You like so bitter drinks.

479
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,320
I just like the original taste.

480
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,095
You wanna eat somthing? Just order anything you like.

481
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,960
No, I've had a meal.

482
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,800
What can I help you?

483
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,000
Just talk turkey.

484
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,960
We're good friends.

485
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
Actually, I don't have many close friends.

486
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,640
Only you, you grew up with me.

487
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,080
Qin Shen's getting closer and closer to other girls now.

488
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,200
It's impossible for me to be with him, right?

489
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,080
Your love to Qin Shen is just like this?

490
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
What?

491
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
As I know,

492
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,760
he's not in a relationship.

493
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,600
You want to give up like this?

494
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,160
But...

495
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,360
If you really like someone,

496
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,640
at least you should try hard to the last moment.

497
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,120
Slow down.

498
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,520
Ling Wei, hurry up.

499
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,360
We'll go first.

500
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,120
Wait for me.

501
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Get this. OK.

502
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,440
Here.

503
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,080
I got it.

504
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,720
Let's go.

505
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,200
Thank you.

506
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,470
Where’re you going?

507
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,350
The dancing team ahead

508
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Ling Wei, we're leaving now.

509
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,680
Thank you.

510
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,560
You're welcome.

511
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,920
Ling Wei, this is Qin Shen in your class, right?

512
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,960
He's really the same as what the rumor said.

513
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,800
He's very handsome.

514
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,160
You're right.

515
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,160
If I give up now,

516
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll betray what I've tried during the past three years.

517
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,440
It really hurts to give up someone.

518
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,720
Thank you. Jia Sicheng.

519
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,800
Everyone is persuading me to give up.

520
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,760
Only you, you always cheer me up.

521
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,320
You're still like a child

522
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,640
and is always emotional.

523
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,960
Actually when you were angry with me,

524
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,280
I'm terrified.

525
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Because I think that

526
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,560
only you're treating me well sincerely.

527
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Only you regard me as a real friend.

528
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,720
It's good that you forgive me.

529
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
I've told you.

530
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,520
I'm not angry with you.

531
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,395
I'm just a little busy at the beginning of the semester.

532
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,365
Let's order something to eat.

533
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,960
I remember what you like.

534
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,880
Qin, you're here.

535
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,840
Check this.

536
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,160
Yuan Qian applied to teach Class Four.

537
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,840
Then you should teach Class One.

538
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,840
Next week, a new teacher will come and coordinate with you.

539
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,040
Director Lin,

540
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,160
the drawing competition is around the corner.

541
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,680
Class One is sure to get the medal.

542
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,280
But now if you change the teacher,

543
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,680
it will influence the students.

544
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,120
But she insists on teaching Class Four.

545
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,640
She said she'll influence you if she stays.

546
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,010
But I think she's suitable

547
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,960
to teach smaller classes according to her ability.

548
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,920
She's perfectly fine to teach bigger classes.

549
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
But with her personality,

550
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,000
she's not fine to teach a class on her own.

551
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,200
Yes.

552
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,200
Ok, I'll think it over.

553
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:31,445
Then director, I'm going to the class.

554
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,880
OK.

555
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,080
Well...

556
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
Director Lin told me that

557
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,840
I'll be in charge of Class Four.

558
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,040
When will you be free?

559
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,120
We shall do the handover.

560
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,480
No.

561
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
If you meet difficulties in your work,

562
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,280
don't say I didn't tell you about it.

563
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,640
No, I won't.

564
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,800
OK, good luck with your job.

565
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,400
Besides,

566
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,085
congratulations.

567
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,520
You don't have to tolerate me from now on.

568
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,000
Director Lin,

569
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,000
you've agreed to let me teach Class Four.

570
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,240
OK.

571
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,800
OK, then I'll guide them well and try to win the competition.

572
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,080
Thank you. Director Lin.

573
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,440
We don't need to do the handover?

574
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,160
No, we don't.

575
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,720
But I have to tell you an unlucky news.

576
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,880
Maybe you should

577
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,040
continue to tolerate me for a while.

578
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,065
Does he have a warning radar

579
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,800
in his brain?

580
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,040
And it'll alarm automatically if he says over five words.

581
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,280
What color do you want to paint on this cloud?

582
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,000
Blue.

583
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,720
Blue.

584
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,360
Here.

585
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,720
Give me

586
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
the laser pen.

587
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
If you continue to be naughty,

588
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,160
I'll tell your father,

589
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,400
you got it?

590
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,240
Give me the watch.

591
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,360
Now I can monitor you on my phone.

592
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,280
I'll inform your parents directly if you don't listen to her.

593
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,160
Mr. Qin.

594
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,680
Now you know what you should do?

595
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,320
Yes.

596
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,760
And you remember it?

597
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes.

598
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Go on painting.

599
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,240
What's that?

600
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,000
This turtle is very ugly.

601
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,960
Check this! Check this!

602
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,400
What're they looking at?

603
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,800
Me?

604
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,080
There's nothing on my face.

605
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,320
Why're they looking at me?

606
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Is it because

607
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm so gorgeous?
