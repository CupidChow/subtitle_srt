1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 17

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,720
Now I'm willing to hear your explanations.

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
Explain on what?

5
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
On what happened that day.

6
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Which day?

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,680
You tell me?

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
How can I know which day you're referring to?

9
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,560
You've been blue,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,720
that's because I didn't message you back, right?

11
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,680
When didn't you message me back?

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,120
Qin Shen.

13
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,600
Is that for me?

14
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,320
Cider vinegar,

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,640
perfect for gaseous distention.

16
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Oh, that day.

17
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,920
I've forgot it if you didn't mention it.

18
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,840
Then why are you blue?

19
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,160
I can't say.

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,200
Actually, you know it...

21
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,160
It's about my transferring.

22
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,560
My roommates had already knew it

23
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,720
and they were mad.

24
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
You really didn't handle this well.

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
I've no idea how to tell them

26
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,680
and was afraid we wouldn't be friends then if they knew it.

27
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,000
And the result now is sure as expected...

28
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,720
Try it again.

29
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,920
How?

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
If you do care about them,

31
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,720
then try it again.

32
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
Why are you here?

33
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm here for my sculpture,

34
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,040
I want to polish it.

35
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,480
- Look! - You wanna have some?

36
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
The picture's beautiful.

37
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,360
Yuan Qian.

38
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,600
You left your thermos in classroom.

39
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
I brought it back...

40
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,280
for you...

41
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,960
I understand

42
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,680
you guys won't forgive me now.

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,280
But I still want to say that...

44
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
actually...

45
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,960
transfering was my aim as I just entered school.

46
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,800
But it was too happy to be with you guys

47
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,840
and I couldn't just split it out when I tried.

48
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,620
I was afraid you may take me as a betrayer

49
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,960
and wouldn't be friends with me anymore.

50
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,600
But I swear,

51
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
I just want to transfer,

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
I've never meant to change my dorm.

53
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
I've asked the administrators

54
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,200
and they said stay in the original dorm is permitted.

55
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
I know...

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,760
it was all my fault that I hadn't told you.

57
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
But I hope you can forgive me.

58
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,720
I do cherish you all.

59
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,320
After I'm in Xuanzhou,

60
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,600
you are nice to me.

61
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
You guys and I are alike,

62
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
we're making friends by heart.

63
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
If I put myself in your shoes,

64
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
I would also be angry

65
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
on you holding issues back from me.

66
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,560
So I understand it.

67
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,440
Sorry.

68
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,720
All I can say is this word.

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,000
Sorry,

70
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm really sorry.

71
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,000
Certainly, interpersonal relationships in college

72
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,680
can be counted as a subject.

73
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,280
But obviously, I've failed it.

74
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,520
We're closing, go back and have a rest.

75
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
We're closing,

76
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
go back and have a rest.

77
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,320
Just for this stuff?

78
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Don't be!

79
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,400
I'm having a period

80
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,920
and is in unstable emotions.

81
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,720
I'm gonna have a bath.

82
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Then should I now

83
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,040
pretend to slip out of tongue that

84
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,000
I want birthday presents.

85
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,160
And you guys will raise money for it.

86
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
Nice try.

87
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,400
Your birthday, your treat.

88
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,440
However,

89
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,280
there could be some presents.

90
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,600
Really?

91
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,480
Bur it should cost no more than five yuan.

92
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,840
You know me.

93
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,080
I don't like those

94
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,000
material girls or gold diggers.

95
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,320
I just want us to be good friends and stay together.

96
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:53,464
Family group chat.

97
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,784
Mom: Sweetheart, happy birthday!

98
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:08,704
Thank you, mom!

99
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,320
What's your arrangements tonight?

100
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,040
Birthday party?

101
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,160
No more birthday party.

102
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
I've grown up.

103
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,280
Since you don't have plans tonight,

104
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,760
what about hang out with me?

105
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
We can check out

106
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,800
if there's your favorite fairy theme cakes

107
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,630
and where can we buy one?

108
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,960
Brother,

109
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,420
are you trying to hit on me

110
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,500
taking advantages of my hard time?

111
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,620
That's exactly what I'm thinking about.

112
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,840
OK. I'll think about it.

113
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,480
Eight o'clock tonight.

114
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,480
I said, I'll think about it.

115
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
I'll wait you downstairs at eight.

116
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,520
Come down if you've considered it well.

117
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,880
We'll say it tonight.

118
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm gonna study.

119
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,400
Even lights have abandoned me?

120
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Happy birthday to you!

121
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,520
Happy birthday to you!

122
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,720
Happy birthday to you!

123
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,720
Happy birthday to you!

124
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,800
Yuan Qian.

125
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,560
Happy birthday!

126
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
What're you doing there? Come here!

127
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,760
You...

128
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,280
This cake is more expensive than the one of mine.

129
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,680
Lu Jianing, your partiality is obvious!

130
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,560
Objection!

131
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,800
Yuan Qian,

132
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,640
I've let the cat out of the bag several times.

133
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,040
I almost couldn't hold it on.

134
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Finally this is the day.

135
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,040
Thank god.

136
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,080
Blow the candles!

137
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,400
The cake's heavy!

138
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
You've been going to far.

139
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
I really thought you didn't want to be my friends.

140
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,480
You won't learn a lesson if we don't scare you.

141
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,920
Will you hide things from us in the future?

142
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,720
Yes.

143
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,440
I was really meant to break up with you.

144
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
But Xue Congyang,

145
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,800
have been chattered in fronf of me,

146
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,200
saying that you're a good girl.

147
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
So we wanted to give you a chance.

148
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,280
You are a good girl.

149
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,160
Yuan Qian,

150
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,600
happy birthday.

151
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,080
Happy birthday.

152
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,760
Make a wish!

153
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,640
Make a wish! Make a wish!

154
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,640
I hope

155
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,400
we'll forever be good as we are today.

156
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,760
I hope my friends around me

157
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,200
will accomplish all their dreams.

158
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
Yuan Qian, it's your birthday.

159
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,320
Make a wish for yorself.

160
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,640
I hope we will always be together.

161
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,840
We sure will!

162
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,320
It will sure come ture!

163
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Blow the candles!

164
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,520
Happy birthday!

165
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,880
Take this out.

166
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,440
Yuan Qian,

167
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,560
you didn't know.

168
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
For you, I've sacrificed

169
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,600
my five day's endeavors on losing weights.

170
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,120
If we know the cake is of such big size,

171
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,920
we should have share some with others.

172
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,440
Oh my god.

173
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,360
What's up?

174
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,600
Remember our appointments?

175
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,720
Sorry, Qin Shen.

176
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
I may can't go out for now.

177
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,760
My roommates celebrated my birthday as I came back.

178
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
You should have a good time with them first.

179
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,560
These guys

180
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,960
have been ignored me for days.

181
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,840
I thought they were really mad at me.

182
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
As I came back, the lights were off.

183
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,880
No one was in there.

184
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,720
I thought they forgot my birthday

185
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,480
or were hiding from me deliberately.

186
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,360
But suddenly the lights were on!

187
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,800
They rushed form the balcony

188
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
with a cake in their hands

189
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,600
and sang songs crazily.

190
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Am I too talkative?

191
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,480
No, it's good.

192
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,720
Then Yuan Qian,

193
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,320
can you meet me after nine

194
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,640
and give me a chance

195
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,000
to celebrate your birthday solely?

196
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,360
OK, that's fine.

197
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,640
I reluctantly give you this chance.

198
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,440
I'll meet you at nine.

199
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,080
There're not many people on this road.

200
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,240
Because it's late.

201
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
So it is.

202
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,760
It's too late.

203
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,800
So I can't take you to chose cakes.

204
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,280
It' OK.

205
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,280
I've already had one with my roommates.

206
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,080
Their suprise for you

207
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,000
did disrupted my plan.

208
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,280
Plan?

209
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,920
What plan?

210
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,440
Well...

211
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,080
Will there come up some arrangements

212
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,600
as we walked?

213
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,920
Many boys now express their love at school

214
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,400
but don't clear up the spot then.

215
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,720
It's not decent.

216
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,560
Then we can clear it up together

217
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,840
after having the sense of ceremony.

218
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,280
I think

219
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,400
a relationship

220
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,720
needs a little bit sense of ceremony.

221
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't like that.

222
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,240
It's better to be like others.

223
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,760
Then what do you straight men like?

224
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,800
Why are you drawing so close?

225
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm terrified.

226
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,600
I love to be straight.

227
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,840
So

228
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
will you be my girl friend?

229
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,200
Do you refer to the meaning

230
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,360
that I'm thinking about?

231
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,680
Yes.

232
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,480
Qin Shen,

233
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,120
you're really a professional single.

234
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,120
You're not romantic and aren't willing to learn.

235
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,440
Is this even a way of expressing love?

236
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,720
Can you be more perfunctory?

237
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,520
It's my birthday today.

238
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,480
You...

239
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,440
I won't, I won't.

240
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,680
Your guardian stone is topaz.

241
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,760
I selected this in person,

242
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,520
and stringed it in person.

243
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,360
Yuan Qian,

244
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,600
happy birthday.

245
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,840
You're acting like leader condoling me.

246
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,480
And the style is too straight.

247
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,040
You're straight,

248
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,760
why didn't you take it out earlier?

249
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,880
You don't like it?

250
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,960
I didn't say that.

251
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,280
Do you have something else to say

252
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,920
beyond "happy birthday"?

253
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,920
Sure.

254
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,920
But you just refused me.

255
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,400
I mean

256
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,280
you should exchange your orders of actions and words.

257
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,840
You should give presents first.

258
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,880
I rejected...

259
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,480
but you can say it again.

260
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,760
Say it again, and I'm yours.

261
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,360
It's OK, I can wait.

262
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,280
You're brilliant.

263
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,680
Nothing.

264
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,840
I mean,

265
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,040
you're promising,

266
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
really promising.

267
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,800
A professional single.

268
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,320
OK.

269
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,400
You wanna say something?

270
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,880
I think

271
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,600
some words seem sincerely if you say it more times.

272
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,280
Happy birthday.

273
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,400
Forget it.

274
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,160
I'm leaving.

275
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
You have nothing to say to me.

276
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,200
Song Siyi sent you a present,

277
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,160
and you wore it and took pics with him.

278
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,200
I think I should have this chance, too.

279
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,600
Don't.

280
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,160
Naive.

281
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,200
You sure you won't turn around?

282
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,720
I don't think the figure of your back looks good.

283
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,600
Do you...

284
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,760
What do you mean?

285
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,600
There're roses here,

286
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,040
so I just borrowed one.

287
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,040
What the hell...

288
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,280
I was actually inspired by the playground,

289
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,480
maybe youngsters should be garish and showy.

290
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,960
So...

291
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,160
Yuan Qian,

292
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,680
would you like to be my girl friend?

293
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,680
You're damaging public property!

294
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,450
This is the stolen good! I'll confiscate it first!

295
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,440
As for you,

296
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,760
I will tell you the answer

297
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,040
after you go through the trial.

298
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,120
Yuan Qian.

299
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,240
Good night.

300
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,680
Jianing. Stop checking your computer.

301
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,520
Look at me.

302
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
My face looks smaller, isn't it?

303
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,320
I got this trick online.

304
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,320
Put a rubber band on your ear,

305
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,720
and your face will get smaller.

306
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,640
Put a rubber band on my ear?

307
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,680
What's that?

308
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,400
See, is my face smaller?

309
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,840
It will work in 15 minutes.

310
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,680
But you just put it on.

311
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,960
I have put it on for a long time.

312
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,080
Is it really working?

313
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm about to have a beautiful jawline.

314
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,280
Let me try it. Come on.

315
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,120
Right?

316
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
I think this side is already smaller than the other.

317
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
At least put both of them on for me.

318
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,680
Don't laugh. I mean it.

319
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,480
It's working.

320
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,480
And it's good for blood circulation.

321
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,800
Asleep?

322
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,720
No. I'm about to.

323
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,360
Breakfast together tomorrow?

324
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,440
Ling Wei.

325
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
Are you sick?

326
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,520
Let's keep the thing about us a secret.

327
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,800
It's not a good idea to tell Qin Shen

328
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,600
that Ling Wei has depression.

329
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,800
It's her privacy after all.

330
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,480
I think we can tell everyone when it's the right time.

331
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,640
For Song Siyi?

332
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,960
So imaginative.

333
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,520
Just keep it a secret.

334
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,240
And tell everyone when it's the time.

335
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Don't let too many people get hurt.

336
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,280
You know.

337
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,600
For those who don't have meat,

338
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,520
we shouldn't make too much noise when eating it.

339
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,080
I didn't eat meant.

340
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,360
I will buy you breakfast tomorrow. Good night.

341
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,120
Look how jealous he is!

342
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,480
Yuan Qian.

343
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,360
Why are you laughing?

344
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,760
Sounds like a chainsaw.

345
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,280
Qin.

346
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,120
Where did you go last nigh? You were so late.

347
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,320
Morning. Yuan Qian.

348
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,640
Qin.

349
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,600
You bought breakfast for a girl?

350
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,920
Have you forgotten your mother, me?

351
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,400
Why didn't you buy it for me?

352
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,640
Take it if you want it.

353
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,680
Qin Shen...

354
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,400
Yuan Qian tutored me the other day,

355
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,280
and I promised to pay her back with a breakfast.

356
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,320
Right. That's it.

357
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,160
Bullshit.

358
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,680
You are the best in our class.

359
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,280
You need tutoring from someone behind you?

360
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,200
Just say it you want to ask her out.

361
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,360
I should go.

362
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,120
Wait.

363
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,800
Give her the breakfast.

364
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,200
I bought it for her.

365
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,240
I'm hungry.

366
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,240
This much

367
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,640
won't be enough for you.

368
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,840
A little hungry and very hungry are the same.

369
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,840
Fine.

370
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,680
Qin.

371
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,160
You are my bro.

372
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,000
Yuan Qian.

373
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,640
Your breakfast.

374
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,440
Qin.

375
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,840
You want to date her?

376
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,680
Or why are you so good to her?

377
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
It's non of your business.

378
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,480
Read your book.

379
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,440
Don't look at me.

380
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm looking outside.

381
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,280
It's a nice day.

382
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,880
Beautiful face is like a devil seducing me.

383
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
It's all true on the internet.

384
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,880
When you meet someone you like,

385
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,080
his pure existence is enough for you.

386
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,600
Song Siyi

387
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,440
Hello.

388
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,000
What are you doing?

389
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,640
I'm studying in the library.

390
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
You're the most hard-working art students.

391
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,480
You're there everyday.

392
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,960
I can't talk in the library.

393
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,400
We should talk later.

394
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,200
Bye.

395
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,920
Wait.

396
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,560
What's wrong?

397
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,040
I have finished my training

398
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,040
and will set off for the competition.

399
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,680
I'm kind of nervous.

400
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,480
And I don't have much to say.

401
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,520
I just want to hear your voice.

402
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,480
I'll feel better listening to you.

403
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,080
Please don't laugh at me.

404
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,680
I don't know why,

405
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,600
but if I can't hear your voice,

406
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,040
I will feel anxious.

407
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,600
Song Siyi.

408
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,160
That's it. I have to go.

409
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,880
We can talk later.

410
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I can't talk in the library.

411
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,520
OK.

412
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm refreshed now.

413
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,320
Bye. I'll do my best.

414
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,600
Attention.

415
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,320
Attention.

416
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,360
The men's single sculls quarterfinal race is about to start.

417
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Song Siyi from the Sports Department of our school

418
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,680
will compete in the race.

419
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,560
The race will be on live streaming

420
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,800
through the screen in the cafeteria.

421
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,760
It's such a good spot to watch the race.

422
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,720
The race is on.

423
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,480
Go! Go! Go!

424
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,600
Get rid of him!

425
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,160
It's not that interesting.

426
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,480
Song Siyi is falling behind.

427
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
He is surpassed by other contestants.

428
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,680
Go! Go! Go!

429
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,760
You're so childish.

430
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,160
Don't stare at other man.

431
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,560
This is a sports game.

432
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,000
But you only look at him.

433
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:19,960
and

434
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,360
I am not happy about it.

435
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,600
You're still in trial period.

436
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,280
Be careful. You may be fired.

437
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,440
As long as I'm not fired,

438
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,040
you can only look at me.

439
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,080
Here we are at the last part of the race.

440
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,560
He is speeding up!

441
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,280
He won the race!

442
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,680
Great!

443
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,920
He won! He won!

444
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,360
Song Siyi has made it to the semifinal race.

445
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
His mark is 7'15".

446
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,600
For the last 500 meters, he reached 37 strokes per minute .

447
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
Song Siyi is a student from Xuanzhou University,

448
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,360
and he is sponsored by Peter Sports.

449
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,080
I won't watch it.

450
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,200
Here.

451
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
I admit that Qin Shen is good at it.

452
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,200
But Song Siyi just finished his race

453
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,440
and doesn't seem any weaker.

454
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
They are monsters!

455
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,720
For the whole morning,

456
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,960
I haven't touched the ball yet.

457
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,120
You don't get it.

458
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,400
This is a competition about men's dignity.

459
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,200
Come on. Everyone.

460
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I have something to say.

461
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,640
Come on. Everyone.

462
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,120
Thank you.

463
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,960
We will compete in the college students basketball league.

464
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,920
And we have one opening

465
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,800
in our cheer leading squad.

466
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,880
Do you have any recommendations?

467
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,360
The one who got in can have extra credits.

468
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,240
I have.

469
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,360
Yuan Qian.

470
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,520
She's good.

471
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,640
You have it too? Is it Ling Wei?

472
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,680
She can make it too.

473
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,240
Yuan Qian can't come.

474
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,680
She can.

475
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,120
And if she come,

476
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,960
I can see her more often.

477
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,040
She'll be here and I'll be here too.

478
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,240
So what?

479
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,520
I'm closer to her.

480
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,920
We grew up together.

481
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,640
And who are you?

482
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,040
Why you can make the decision for her?

483
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm her classmate.

484
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,200
So what?

485
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,080
Just a classmate.

486
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
You can call her and ask her about it.

487
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,200
Fine.

488
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,280
Yuan Qian.

489
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,400
Do you want to be

490
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,920
the cheerleader for our team?

491
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,080
You can get extra credits for it.

492
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,840
If you come,

493
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,200
I can see you more often.

494
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,320
Of course.

495
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,960
I recommend you right away.

496
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,200
This is a quiet byway.

497
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,720
We'll be fine here.

498
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,400
Right.

499
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,160
I can get extra credits if I join the cheerleading group.

500
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,480
Do you think I should go?

501
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,800
You're about to have your examination.

502
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,440
It's OK.

503
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,800
I can work on both of them.

504
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,480
Your period.

505
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,120
It's not yet.

506
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,280
It's in the end of the month.

507
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,320
And I can exercise a little during my period.

508
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,000
You can't.

509
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,040
Why?

510
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,960
I said you can't.

511
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,560
Song Siyi.

512
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,600
Hello.

513
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,840
Yuan Qian. Have you decided?

514
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,840
I... I will pass.

515
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,600
I've been occupied by the department's matters.

516
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,000
Why did he hang up?

517
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,160
You're upset?

518
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,320
No. No.

519
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,880
- I would hang up if he didn't. - Yuan Qian.

520
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,520
You...?

521
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,840
We are heading to the classroom.

522
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,800
Why don't you go?

523
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,840
I think it's a good chance.

524
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,000
And you can see us playing.

525
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,000
She doesn't have the time.

526
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,320
How do you know it?

527
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,640
I'm her classmate.

528
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,920
You classmates are too troublesome.

529
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,680
We classmates are close to each other.

530
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,720
Just go.

531
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,080
I have to talk to Yuan Qian.

532
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,720
No.

533
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,880
No. No. No.

534
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,320
I got things to do. I have to go.

535
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,360
Keep going.

536
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,040
Qin Shen.

537
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,000
Hello.

538
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,880
Sit.

539
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,920
It's all my fault.

540
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,080
Scold me if you want.

541
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,000
Look.

542
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,720
No one knows about us.

543
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,760
And I don't want to freak them out.

544
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,360
What do you say?

545
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
We should change a place.

546
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,960
That's the one

547
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,800
who should clean this area.

548
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,840
It must be hard for you to do this secret job.

549
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,720
Let's go.

550
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,600
I hate it.

551
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,200
You recommended me into the student's union,

552
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,280
but it's just constant cleaning job.

553
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,280
Wei.

554
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,520
Did you hear me?

555
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,240
I did.

556
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,360
And I'm waiting for you.

557
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,360
Ling Wei.

558
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,960
Why are you here? Looking for someone?

559
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,680
I'm here for Yuan Qian.

560
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,320
Let me call her.

561
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:15,960
Yuan Qian.

562
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,840
Ling Wei is waiting you.

563
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,000
Ling Wei. What's wrong?

564
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,920
Here's the thing.

565
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,320
My father's school wants to publish a children's book,

566
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,920
and he needs someone learning art

567
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
to do the illustrations.

568
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,200
It'll be paid.

569
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,160
I think you are the best choice,

570
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,520
so I'm here to ask you.

571
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,360
I've asked Mr. Lin.

572
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,520
And she said you got the ability.

573
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,920
Can you help me, please?

574
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,840
OK. No problem.

575
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,280
Thank you so much.

576
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,320
I'll be off then.

577
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,080
I've been inspecting in the library,

578
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,640
and I often saw them

579
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,280
sitting at the last row of the studying area.

580
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,240
And They acted close.

581
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,480
Qin Shen also used her cup.

582
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,280
Do you think it's normal?
