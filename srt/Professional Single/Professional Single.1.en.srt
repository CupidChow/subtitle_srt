It's impossible for you to win with just a 5 in your hand!

I object.

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,200
I didn't play it.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
My clean face shows clearly that

98
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
I didn't have any kind of recreational activities.

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,080
Your clean face

100

thus becomes the dream of over 10 thousands girls here.

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,320
However, his coldness and distance

117
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,480
smashes most of the dreams.

118
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,040
It's the most known that

119
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,640
you can only admire him from a distance.

120
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
People always call us as

121
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,160
"doomed love"

122
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,360
because they are homophones with our names.

123
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,040
It's lucky that we don't have much interactions.

124

Crap!

130
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,640
Why is today the day of course selection?

131
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,600
I can't get the course I want and the system is a piece of crap.

132
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,360
But I can't miss the examination for transference.

133
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I've been working the whole semester for the day.

134

135

00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,520
Come to the computer room. I got one!

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,800
I got some business now.

139
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,560
What is more important than selection?

140
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
The computer room is stuffed

141
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,840
for course selection.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,480
You will miss the popular course.

143

Be it then.

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,800
Why is that? We've never had much conversation.

148
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,840
I really got the bad luck recently.

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,200
I'm going for sketching.

150
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,840

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,160
Help!

158
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Are you alright?

159
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,400
What time is it?

160
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
8:50.

161
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
Can you get my box?

162
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,880
Hero.

163
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,240
Thanks a lot.

164
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,080
You should go change.

165
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,200
Never take off my shoes first again.

166
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,280
Life comes before shoes.

167
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,040
Excuse me.

168
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,880
Wait. Wait.

169
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,720
Why are you drenched?

170
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,640
Did you fall in the lake?

171
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,720
Ma'am, I did fall in the water.

172
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,280
Can I take the examination?

173
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,360
OK.

174
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,160
Docket.

175
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,480
It's you?

176
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,800
It's me.

177
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,320
Look. It's the same like me.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
Not so same.

179
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,640
I can't confirm your identity by this.

180
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,720
This examination is important for me

181
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,840
and I've worked for it for so long.

182
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
I didn't even change my clothes.

183
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
My paint was fished up

184
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,120
from the water.

185
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
I can't confirm your identity,

186
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,880
so I can't let you in by the rules.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,720
You can leave.

188
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,040
Go.

190
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,280
Qin.

191
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Did you go digging lotus roots?

192
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,440
What's that?

193
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
Why is there mud?

194
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
What happened exactly?

195
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,080
Mud boy.

196
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,720
I went to fetch the sculpture,

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,800
and I ran into Yuan Qian.

198
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,320
And?

199
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,080
She fell into the lake.

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Everything alright?

201
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm fine.

202
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,760
It's not you.

203
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,960
I mean the girl.

204
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,120
She got picked up by a rowing guy.

205
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,360
What about you?

206
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,760
You didn't do anything

207
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,920
but took off your shoes and dug dirt?

208
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
He was faster.

209
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,560
Have you tried to pull her up?

210
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,040
I didn't get her.

211
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,680
How can such man exist?

212
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
The sculpture and I fell into the water,

213
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,200
and

214
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,680
he saved the sculpture.

215
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,160
My examination was ruined also.

216
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
He doesn't understand romance at all.

217
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,520
If it's a regular romance drama,

218
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
this may represent the start of your love.

219
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,200
This won't even happen in dramas.

220
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,040
How can anyone pick him as a hero?

221
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,080
It doesn't surprise me you did it.

222
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,640
Well, listen to me once.

223
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,960
If you protected her,

224
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,600
the girl

225
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,880
would be so grateful

226
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,840
and think of you as her savior.

227
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't need gratitude.

228
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
Why?

229
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
How can you be so cold

230
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,440
as such a young man?

231
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,280
Right.

232
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Too much trouble.

233
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,680
You know him?

234
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,200
That's something.

235
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Yuan Qian. I have been having a thing for you.

236
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,280
I'll wait you downstairs.

237
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,320
And I brought you something.

238
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,920
Who is that?

239
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,560
Go check it out.

240
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,680
You just say you want to fall in love,

241
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,800
but you don't even want to meet the man.

242
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,840
Alright. I'll meet him.

243
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,280
Don't be tricked by the appearance.

244
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,920
Maybe he just feels strange about his ear.

245
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,640
I didn't see it. I didn't see it.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't focus too much on details.

247
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
It's a kind of disease.

248
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,560
Hello, Yuan Qian.

249
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,480
I have just one request:

250
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,480
Don't touch me.

251
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,240
Hello.

252
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,680
You are...?

253
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,240
Liu Tian.

254
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,240
Courtesy name: Boyang.

255
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
I know you fell into the lake,

256
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,080
and I'm afraid that you may get ill.

257
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
I brought you some medicine.

258
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,880
It's OK. I'm fine.

259
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,480
- Thank you. - Take it.

260
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,640
You will be my girlfriend.

261
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,320
How is it?

262
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,480
How do you feel? What's his name?

263
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,240
Which school is he in?

264
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,680
I don't know.

265
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,040
Another hero died.

266
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,720
What's the reason this time?

267
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
His little finger nail is like 5 cm long.

268
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
And he used it to pick his ear.

269
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,680
He talked to me in my face.

270
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,240
The most important is his bad breath.

271
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
He may love me too much and hate me for it.

272
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
Then you should find yourself a man!

273
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,640
It's hard, and Lu Jianing stops introducing man to me.

274
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,680
I...

275
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,560
I really can't feel anything

276
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,720
to those you introduced to me.

277
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,240
The first one walks in slippers without washing his feet.

278
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,080
The second one wastes food.

279
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,120
What about the third one?

280
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,000
You met him for 3 times.

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
I thought you could make it.

282
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,560
We like the same thing,

283
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,680
and get things to talk about.

284
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,640
Most importantly,

285
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
we like the same band.

286
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,560
However,

287
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,120
we have different accents in speaking English.

288
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,680
He corrected me for 15 minutes.

289
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,520
It's just...

290
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,320
Alright.

291
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,520
I get it.

292
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,160
You can't blame me for that.

293
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,200
You know

294
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,600
I don't ask very much of a boyfriend.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,280
Male. Alive.

296
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,840
But I just can't find one.

297
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,320
Is it because I'm ugly?

298
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,560
I don't think I'm that ugly.

299
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
Even I can't find a boyfriend.

300
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,560
What does it mean?

301
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,840
What does it mean?

302
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,800
It means the boy now are all plain.

303
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
And I just can't just make do with it.

304
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
Have you heard that

305
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,480
longing for others means you fear life.

306
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,560
I have met a lot of boys,

307
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,280
and I find I don't fear anything.

308
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,800
So why do I need a man?

309
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,360
I saw two words in you:

310
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
professional single.

311
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,840
Yuan Qian, you're here?

312
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,440
Well, I got some business.

313
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,360
I have to go for a while.

314
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,360
Ma'am,

315
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,200
you said you wanted me for something?

316
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,840
Right.

317
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,520
I know what happened to your examination.

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
Look what you've done. You...

319
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,000
Of course,

320
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,840
there's still something you can do.

321
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,720
What is it?

322
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,560
Actually,

323
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,520
we usually shut down the transference system

324
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,440
after the first year,

325
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,960
so before the end of this semester,

326
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,560
there's another examination.

327
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,120
Really?

328
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,160
However,

329
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
don't be too excited about it.

330
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Stuffs about oil painting

331
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
will be tested on that exam,

332
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,520
and there're only a limited places of 3

333
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,720
for oil painting.

334
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,600
Now, 2 places have been taken.

335
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
To get the last place,

336
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,880
you not only need to pass the examination,

337
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,280
you also have to rank the top 3 among your peers.

338
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,560
No matter how hard is it,

339
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
I will make it.

340
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,720
Yuan Qian.

341
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,480
Isn't that Song Siyi?

342
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
He saved you.

343
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,360
It's a lot.

344
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
Let me take them for you.

345
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
Thank you so much.

346
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,040
It's nothing.

347
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,400
Let's share them.

348
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
We can't let you carry all of them.

349
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,280
I can do it on my own.

350
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,120
We could have gone up in no time.

351
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
Why did you waste our time?

352
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,560
Give that to me too.

353
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,440
It's OK. I can handle it.

354
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,360
OK.

355
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,640
Well, let me take one for you.

356
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,280
Song Siyi is great.

357
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,040
He's cute and kind.

358
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,720
He is also paying for himself by working in the cafeteria.

359
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,720
And he is kind to everyone.

360
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,840
He could have lived an easy life,

361
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,760
but he still chose to do these hard works

362
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,040
to experience life.

363
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,720
I heard a lot of girls like him.

364
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,920
If I were you,

365
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,160
I would buy some gifts for him.

366
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,240
He saved your life.

367
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
What should I give him?

368
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,640
It's hard.

369
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,040
Apart from my dad,

370
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,800
I've never given anything to other men.

371
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,040
He may misunderstand my intention.

372
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,960
Come on.

373
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,640
He is popular among girls.

374
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,680
It's good enough if you don't make a move on him.

375
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,720
I don't like the man who is good to everyone.

376
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,280
Thank you.

377
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,160
Wait a moment.

378
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,920
I'm sorry. We run out of soup.

379
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,000
No. No. No.

380
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,360
I have something to say to you.

381
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
Me?

382
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,920
Thank you that day.

383
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,120
I just passed by.

384
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,320
You don't need to, really.

385
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,360
I should.

386
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,760
It's just a smartwatch.

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,880
It will be useful.

388
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,400
Thank you.

389
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
I do need it.

390
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
There is nothing between us.

391
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,960
I don't like the guy

392
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
who is good to everyone.

393
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,960
If he is good to everyone,

394
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,040
when he is good to me

395
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,640
how can I know if I'm special to him?

396
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,080
OK. That's all.

397
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,120
I'll hang up.

398
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,440
Yuan Qian.

399
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,000
How can I be caught up on talking behind his back?

400
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,760
You left your meal card.

401
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm sorry. I was careless.

402
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,160
It's nothing.

403
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,920
Bye-bye.

404
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,440
I have to meet the dean.

405
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,440
I'll be off. Bye.

406
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,120
I don't like the guy

407
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,680
who is good to everyone.

408
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,960
If he is good to everyone,

409
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,320
when he is good to me,

410
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,640
how can I know I'm special to him?

411
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,840
You can't be nice to everyone.

412
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,240
If you do that,

413
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
I won't tell if you're really nice to me.

414
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,720
It can't be.

415
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,160
Can I help you?

416
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,000
Why is your face red?

417
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
Maybe I wear too much.

418
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Are you having a fever?

419
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
I have to go.

420
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
I have to meet the dean.

421
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,280
You should go to the hospital first.

422
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
The birth chart says

423
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
I'll run into bad things every time I meet you.

424
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,920
You should stay away from me.

425
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
I'm going to have the meeting

426
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,480
about welcoming Xiao Jing.

427
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
Don't make troubles for me.

428
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,600
Anyway. Xiao Jing is more important.

429
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,920
I have always liked him.

430
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,360
Now I get the chance to meet him.

431
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,080
Sir.

432
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,440
You will receive Xiao Jing tomorrow, right?

433
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,480
She.

434
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,320
She will.

435
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,080
She was picked out

436
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
to receive Xiao Jing.

437
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,520
Alright.

438
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,760
Sit.

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,440
I'll make it short.

440
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,640
Xiao Jing

441
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,400
will arrive at 9 am tomorrow.

442
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,600
Xiao Jing

443
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,200
is an honorary alumnus of our school.

444
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,360
This time,

445
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,560
he contributes his award-winning works for this exhibition,

446
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,520
Seven Emotions.

447
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,720
This time,

448
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,720
we have to be very serious

449
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,640
about his visit.

450
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,520
Definitely. We will.

451
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,120
The general process

452
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,960
is in here.

453
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,880
Someone will drive to pick him up.

454
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,000
And

455
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,400
you will be in charge of...

456
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,200
You will

457
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,640
show him the way

458
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,000
to the workshop.

459
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:45,840
And...

460
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,720
Serve the tea

461
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,080
after the guest arrives.

462
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,320
It will be a bad manner

463
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,840
if the tea turns cold.

464
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
Understand?

465
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,120
Change one.

466
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,280
Change.

467
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,480
Sir. I can do it.

468
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,760
The reception and the workshop

469
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,880
is very important.

470
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,720
This may affect

471
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,080
our admissions next year.

472
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,840
Go back

473
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,000
and take some medicine.

474
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,800
Get well.

475
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,440
You will have other opportunities.

476
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,040
Go. Go back.

477
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,360
Thank you, sir.

478
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,920
Thank you for your time.

479
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,120
Goodbye, sir.

480
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,640
It's such a perfect time

481
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
to catch the cold.

482
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,440
My willpower is weak.

483
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
How can't I just hold a few coughs?

484
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,160
It's such a tragic. How about Xiao Jing?

485
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,560
What?

486
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,400
It seemed you're busy,

487
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,640
so I got you some medicine.

488
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,400
I don't need them.

489
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,280
It won't help even I get well.

490
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,880
I don't want to be in debt.

491
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,760
I got a part of your falling into the water.

492
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,640
I do what I should do.

493
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
As for the medicine,

494
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,720
I don't care if you'll take it.

495
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,440
Right.

496
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,360
The place you choose to sketch is dangerous.

497
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,840
How about sketching according to the picture?

498
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
He not only has a poker face,

499
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
but also is a retard.

500
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,000
His will do.

501
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
No, I really can't.

502
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
Maybe my hand is too small.

503
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
This is a practical.

504
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
You're free to create anything.

505
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,840
It should be no more than

506
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,120
40 cm in length, width, and height,

507
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,040
Get started.

508
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
Professor.

509
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,320
Is it because of the sculpture exhibition?

510
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,600
Where did you hear that?

511
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,200
But you are right.

512
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,000
The best work will be exhibited along with

513
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
Xiao Jing's works.

514
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,240
You asked for it.

515
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,720
Don't smash your sculpture again.

516
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,040
Thank you, sir.

517
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
I can finally meet Xiao Jing.

518
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
Jianing told me that

519
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,120
you were not exactly happy

520
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,320
when you got the news?

521
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,160
I thought if I forgot all the miseries about Qin Shen,

522
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,440
I could be normal again

523
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,560
and meet Xiao Jing.

524
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,320
But I got a bad feeling about it.

525
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,920
What's wrong?

526
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,280
The cold won't leave me in a while.

527
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,760
Class dismissed.

528
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,600
Everyone.

529
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,560
Let's call it a wrap

530
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,440
and go have the meal.

531
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,280
Remember to put away your sculptures.

532
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,240
Let's go.

533
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,720
Class dismissed.

534
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,640
Yuan Qian.

535
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,520
We are free in the subject,

536
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,960
but I think the teacher will judge the work

537
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,280
from its characteristic.

538
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,960
So I made a pig,

539
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,960
which means being content with what we have.

540
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,000
You are a student of sculpture now.

541
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,640
Can you stop being cheesy?

542
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,360
Yuan Qian.

543
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,040
Are you sure it's your first work?

544
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,840
It's the large version of my hand.

545
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,600
How is it? Can I get the No. 1?

546
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,320
Even it's great,

547
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,640
I hate to tell you that

548
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,760
Qin Shen is better than you.

549
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,400
Why do you talk about him again?

550
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,440
Qin Shen's work is a master level.

551
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,400
I really doubt that

552
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,680
if we are on the same grade.

553
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,680
Will I still be on the exhibition?

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,680
If I can't make it,

555
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,720
I can't meet Xiao Jing.

556
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,160
He gets on my way every time.

557
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,960
How about you sabotage his work

558
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,840
in the afternoon,

559
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,800
and he won't have anything to turn in.

560
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Maybe, your hand may beat my perfect pig

561
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,560
and get in.

562
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,880
And you can also meet Xiao Jing

563
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
you miss every day.

564
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,760
This is a good idea.

565
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,360
I almost want to think about it seriously.

566
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,680
Why were you so quiet?

567
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
When did you come?

568
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,360
When you said you wanted to sabotage my sculpture.

569
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm not someone who will do that.

570
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
Is it your spray?

571
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,520
Thank you.

572
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,000
Why don't you eat?

573
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
You can eat it. I barely touch it.

574
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,680
No. No.

575
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,200
I'm on a diet.

576
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,800
Eat. It's OK.

577
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,360
I have to go to the sculpture classroom.

578
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,040
Why are you going there?

579
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,640
I'm going to get my sculpture leveled up

580
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
and beat Qin Shen with it

581
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,800
to get in the exhibition.

582
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
You work too hard.

583
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,960
If you worked like that on finding a boyfriend,

584
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,800
you would have made it already.

585
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,320
Compared to my future,

586
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,160
a boyfriend

587
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,640
is nothing.

588
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,640
It's such a bad luck.

589
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
The plug is off already?

590
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,240
There is not even a light.

591
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,360
If not for the exhibition,

592
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,480
I won't work this hard.

593
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,520
What's this?

594
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,640
Crap.

595
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,800
Just as Luo Xinxin predicted.

596
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,320
He won't believe me no matter what.

597
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,280
I can't tell him.

598
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,200
He will think I did this on purpose.

599
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,160
No one saw it

600
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,200
and no one saw me.

601
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,560
Skulls are all alike, anyway.

602
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,840
I can repair it for him.

603
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
You ruined my examination.

604
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,800
So you owed me.

605
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,720
Forget it.

606
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,000
It's a different thing.

607
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,280
Let's have a fair play.

608
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
Why are there bananas in workout meals?

609
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,040
It can get me stronger. Understand?

610
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,440
Won't there be too much nutrition?

611
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
How is your work?

612
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,280
They will be graded soon.

613
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,120
A thief came last night.

614
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,280
What's missing?

615
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,320
My work was sabotaged.

616
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,800
It's perfect.

617
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,080
Why do you say it's sabotaged?

618
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,280
Right.

619
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,120
It's not mine.

620
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,520
It's the skull

621
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,840
you made the other day.

622
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Pretty much the same.

623
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,880
It's not, as I said.

624
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,200
Where're you going?

625
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,720
Surveillance tape.

626
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,160
Are you waiting for me?

627
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,120
You...

628
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,640
I know it's you.

629
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,120
How did you know it?

630
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,680
You always use your own stuff.

631
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,280
Why the surveillance tape then?

632
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,880
I just want to know

633
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,440
if you will turn yourself in.

634
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,440
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,800
I crashed your sculpture last night.

636
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,000
But I spent the whole night to repair it.

637
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,720
I didn't except that a spray would sell me out.

638
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,960
No.

639
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,240
I knew it was not my work from the first sight.

640
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,280
Sprinkling pot was just to identify the murderer.

641
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,330
I'm so sorry that I crashed your sculpture.

642
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,800
But murderer is a heavy word for me.

643
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,680
I thought I did a good restoration.

644
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,800
If you think there is any problem,

645
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,600
I can revise it.

646
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,880
My skull,

647
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,560
is different from any other general skulls.

648
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,040
It adheres to my brain MRI.

649
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,280
What's wrong with you?

650
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,400
Take your shoddy brain out.

651
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,200
Moping about murderer, shoddy works.

652
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,920
I spent a whole night to repair it.

653
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,280
Revising it yourself if you're not satisfied.

654
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,880
Otherwise, how could we have a fair battle?!

655
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,000
You're not of the level to battle with me.

656
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,440
You're the worst.

657
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
This is good. Who made it?

658
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,840
Him.

659
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,120
Not mine.

660
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,920
After all, it was my fault.

661
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,260
I must be responsible for it.

662
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,640
Otherwise, you won't have any work.

663
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,640
There's no "almost" in my world.

664
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
An almost one has no difference with a garbage.

665
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,400
Fine.

666
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,600
Whatever.

667
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,120
It's your work,

668
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
don't be shy to admit it.

669
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,560
Sorry teacher, I got it wrong.

670
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I thought you were talking Qin Shen's work.

671
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,520
Qin Shen, your homework?

672
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,200
I didn't finish it this time.

673
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,720
Sorry.

674
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,480
But I will finish it ASAP.

675
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,240
It's too late.

676
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,080
The opportunity will go to Jia Sicheng.

677
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,760
Thanks, teacher.

678
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Qin.

679
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,200
How could it be garbage?

680
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,160
It's perfect!

681
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,240
You're the freak using brain MRI for sculpture design!

682
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,000
But he was right,

683
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,160
compared with Jia Sicheng,

684
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,520
mine was a little bit low.

685
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,440
Does god really don't want me to

686
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,560
meet Xiao Jing?!

687
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,760
No way.

688
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,280
I can't give up this way.

689
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,000
You're not this type.

690
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,360
Hey what,

691
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,720
you walk like a ghost!

692
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,920
What now?!

693
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,520
Classmates were all left.

694
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,080
Why?

695
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,400
To see Xiao Jing.

696
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
Xiao Jing.

697
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,680
Any problems?

698
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,640
You're going like this?

699
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Come in.

700
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
Dirty as you but unwilling to come to public bath.

701
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,080
Speaking of that Xiao Jing,

702
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,600
how could him left so early?

703
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,640
I just washed my face and get dressed,

704
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,200
and he's left.

705
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,440
Maybe this is destiny.

706
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,040
Destiny my foot.

707
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,000
From now on, me and that Qin,

708
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
would be the enemy of no ice cream in winter,

709
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,000
and no watermelon in summer.

710
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,240
How could there be such a kind of enemy?

711
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,160
Right, Yuan Qian,

712
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,600
don't go deep inside.

713
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,920
There's a terry story of the bath.

714
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,440
Long long ago,

715
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,360
there's a girl,

716
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,960
who had an accident in the shower stand

717
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,720
at the end of the corridor.

718
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,760
Her blood washed the bathing floor.

719
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,640
Girls were greatly frightened.

720
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,760
So the door at the end,

721
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,680
was locked by school for years.

722
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,200
Really?

723
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
I don't believe it.

724
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,480
You should!

725
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,040
Yuan Qian,

726
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,900
keep searching.

727
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,480
I'll take bath first.

728
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,560
Is this the door

729
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,520
which Luo Xinxin talked about?

730
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,920
The bathhouse had a terry story.

731
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,200
Many years ago,

732
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,320
there's a girl,

733
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,880
who had an accident in the shower stand

734
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,280
at the end of the corridor.

735
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,640
So the door at the end

736
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,120
was locked tight by school for years.

737
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,200
Would it be so horrible as Xinxin said?

738
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,920
It won't be true.
