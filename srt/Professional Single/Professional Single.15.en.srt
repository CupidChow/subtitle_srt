1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,840
What are you doing with a stone?

4
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,600
It's for you, a souvenir.

5
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Can you change it to a smaller one?

6
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm so tired all day long.

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,760
I don't want to bring back

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,840
such a heavy souvenir.

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,560
This is the one that made you sprained.

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,920
It proves how desperate you are today.

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,920
Be careful.

12
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,560
What?

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,320
You carry such a big stone all day?

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,920
You were carrying it. I only carried you.

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,360
I see.

16
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,160
No wonder your bag is so heavy.

17
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,480
The stone is really heavy.

18
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,880
You two, hurry up. We're taking pictures.

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,000
Coming.

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,760
Hurry up.

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
Do you have something to say?

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,000
Only dirty words, do you want to hear that?

23
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
Yuan Qian, what's wrong with you?

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Why are you limping?

25
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,320
Come here, have a seat.

26
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,600
You…

27
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,320
Are you injured?

28
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
Just need some rest.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
But orienteering is not for human beings indeed.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm exhausted.

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,000
Whose clothes are you wearing?

32
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:34,920
It's Qin Shen's clothes.

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
Stop it.

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,563
I have explained it countless times.

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,160
My clothes were torn when I fell.

36
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,560
If I didn't wear his clothes,

37
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,680
everyone will see me naked.

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
Ask no more. Or I will kill myself.

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
My god. What's this?

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,040
Yuan Qian.

41
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,800
Don't you feel tired bringing such a big stone all the way?

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
I said the same.

43
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,400
Unfortunately, he is a universal level

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
insensitive man.

45
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,440
He said it was a gift for me.

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,560
My god.

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,000
This can be called a gift?

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,495
I don't understand.

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,000
Why did he give you a stone?

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,400
Maybe it is used to hit him on the head.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
Good for you.

52
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,880
Be careful.

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,840
Didn't you say that we should go our own way

54
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,240
and that you would never see me again?

55
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm just following orders.

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,353
The newspaper is published.

57
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,680
The senior asked me to bring it to you.

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,680
Thank you.

59
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,720
Mission accomplished. I am leaving.

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,840
What's wrong with your foot?

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,080
I accidentally scratched it when I went ashore.

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
No one cares about me. How miserable I am!

63
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,240
Don't pretend to be pitiful.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Just tell me if you need help.

65
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,200
Where is your athlete's agility?

66
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,320
How can you get scratched when going ashore?

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,960
You are so stupid.

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,080
Don't touch me.

69
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,200
I would turn your small wound into a larger one.

70
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,160
Just do it.

71
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,873
Then I'll be able to have a reason to ask for a leave.

72
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,600
Done. Remember don't get it wet these days.

73
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
I will.

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,320
I'll go training.

75
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,040
Thank you,

76
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
little Yuan Qian who helps others.

77
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,618
Do you still have to train when you are injured?

78
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,920
Are you fascinated by my persistence?

79
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,720
There is no problem with my eyes.

80
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,760
I told you don't touch me.

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,600
You should always bear in mind that I am a lady.

82
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,960
You are a lady now?

83
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Not my big brother?

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,760
Big brother can also be a lady.

85
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,840
Are you a lady?

86
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,520
Sure!

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
I am a lady even if you make me bald.

88
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
Qin. Big news!

89
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,280
Why are you so gossipy when something happened to Qin?

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,907
Chen Qinan, are you watching the scene of bustle?

91
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
Piss off.

92
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,760
Qin.

93
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,720
Watch this.

94
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,840
Piss off.

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,240
Leave your lousy sculpture alone.

96
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,200
Your "wife" is about to be stolen!

97
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,040
Piss off.

98
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,520
What happened?

99
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,360
Qin, are you jealous me handsomer than you?

100
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
Why are you disfiguring me?

101
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
I said your "wife" is about to be stolen!

102
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,720
Let me have a look.

103
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,800
Came across little brother when strolling.

104
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,920
Is the girl beside him the legendary important girl?

105
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,720
I just want to tell you about this.

106
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:41,640
If you don't take actions,

107
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,440
Yuan Qian will be in relationship with him.

108
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,600
Can you dig some for me?

109
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,240
The mud on the outer side have been dug up.

110
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,360
I can't reach those in the back.

111
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,160
Just stretch your arm.

112
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,520
You just said you won't dig it for me?

113
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
You're in the way.

114
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,520
If I don't dig for you,

115
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,840
should I wait for you till tomorrow?

116
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,080
So double-faced.

117
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,440
I heard you are going to have a business trip with Prof. Jin?

118
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,960
I heard that

119
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,040
you and your childhood partner are very close recently?

120
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,840
Who?

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,040
You mean Song Siyi?

122
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm not close to him.

123
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
I wish he would be far away from me.

124
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,480
You haven't answered the question I asked you.

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,880
Are you going on a business trip?

126
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,200
Do you want me to go?

127
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
If I don't want you to go, will you cancel it?

128
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,280
Hello.

129
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,480
Song Siyi.

130
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
You have my meal card?

131
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,680
Well...

132
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,560
can you send it over to me?

133
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,360
I'm leaving.

134
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,680
Why are you leaving?

135
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
You haven't answered my question yet.

136
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,720
All right. Send it over if you want.

137
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm gonna let you go.

138
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,480
Chen Qinan, give her a hand.

139
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,440
Give it to me.

140
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
He's leaving?

141
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Leave him alone.

142
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
It's the same as I help you.

143
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,960
Do you think Qin Shen

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
will go on a business trip with Prof. Jin?

145
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,480
There is a good chance that he will not go.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,520
I guess

147
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,240
he is afraid that someone would steal your heart

148
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
while he is away.

149
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,920
Someone?

150
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,000
Someone surnamed Song.

151
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,960
I dare not to mention his name now.

152
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,720
I am afraid that Qin

153
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,520
would beat me up if he hears it,

154
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,538
and educate me how to be a man.

155
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,640
He really won't go?

156
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,120
Of course.

157
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,760
Professor Jin

158
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,320
has already persuaded him twice.

159
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,920
He repeatedly rejected opportunities

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,240
that others dreamed of.

161
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,520
This is the difference between the genius and the mortal.

162
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,560
There're lot of people in the bathhouse today.

163
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,240
Hurry up if you guys want to go.

164
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,200
Xinxin.

165
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,640
Do you still have that facial mask?

166
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,400
Lend me some.

167
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,080
Be quiet. Be quiet.

168
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,000
It's the crucial moment.

169
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,080
Crucial moment?

170
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,520
All right.

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing now?

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,880
“What are you doing now?” Is it subtle enough?

173
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,960
Will he reply me?

174
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,560
So sweet.

175
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,600
What TV series are you watching?

176
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,160
Is it good?

177
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
So good.

178
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,000
Come on.

179
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Join me.

180
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,840
Look how handsome this protagonist is.

181
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,560
So sweet.

182
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,960
It's so funny.

183
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,160
Sister.

184
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,120
You've finished my snacks.

185
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,680
Compared to our friendship,

186
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,400
a bag of snacks is nothing.

187
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
Compared to snacks,

188
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,840
our friendship is nothing.

189
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,360
Wait a moment.

190
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,840
Let's do it together.

191
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,920
Sit-ups.

192
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
What time is it now?

193
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,080
Ten past ten.

194
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,920
Yuan Qian.

195
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,960
Are you King Kong Barbie today?

196
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,080
Aren't you tired?

197
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
Let's continue, what next?

198
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,000
Piss off.

199
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,960
I quit.

200
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,120
Go for Xue Congyang.

201
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,000
Xuexue.

202
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,520
Yuan Qian, good night.

203
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,040
What time is it now?

204
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,760
It's half past ten.

205
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,320
Okay.

206
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,720
If I wait for your messages again in the future,

207
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,880
I am a fool.

208
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,840
I just had a bath.

209
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,840
What a coconut. Let's have a dinner together tomorrow.

210
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,160
I'd like to be a fool.

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Okay.

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,440
Others will reply in seconds.

213
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,720
Look at him.

214
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,760
It took him 7358 seconds to reply to me.

215
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,520
Welcome.

216
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,680
I forgot to look in the mirror when I went out.

217
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,800
You put on a make up so well without using mirror.

218
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,840
Great.

219
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,360
Seeing through without speaking out is the basic rule.

220
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,280
What?

221
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,760
I said I forgot to look in the mirror when I went out.

222
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,160
If you are a gentleman,

223
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,360
you should say that

224
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,224
you're beautiful even if you don't check in the mirror

225
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
instead of revealing the truth.

226
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,040
You look beautiful.

227
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,800
You made me

228
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,080
don't know how to diss you back.

229
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
I did what you told me.

230
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
I sincerely mean that.

231
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,240
Right?

232
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,000
Right.

233
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,596
But this doesn't seem to fit your setting of characteristics.

234
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
What settings?

235
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,520
Straight man.

236
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,000
No, this is not your setting.

237
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,240
This is your nature.

238
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,600
I'll answer the phone first.

239
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,320
Don't worry, I won't flee without paying.

240
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,160
Order whatever you like.

241
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Is she

242
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
the gossip girlfriend of Song Siyi?

243
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,880
It seems to be.

244
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,680
She looks pretty.

245
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,120
Unexpectedly, she is such a person.

246
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,000
Fortunately, the company clarified it.

247
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,800
How could Song Siyi

248
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,240
like a girl with a messy private life?

249
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,040
Exactly.

250
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,040
Song Siyi is going to be popular soon.

251
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,400
How's that possible?

252
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,080
Exactly.

253
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,920
Be quiet.

254
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,960
You know them?

255
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,760
So direct?

256
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,680
Is it because…?

257
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,040
Shall we leave?

258
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,040
Let's go.

259
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,080
Does it work?

260
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,760
There're so many ways back to the dormitory,

261
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,080
but he chose the most remote one.

262
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,560
What's going on between you and Song Siyi?

263
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,320
You like him?

264
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,120
Of course not.

265
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:48,520
He and I have known each other for years.

266
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,707
If we want to be together, we would have long before.

267
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,520
He is like…

268
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,920
my cousin.

269
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,960
It's late, go back and have a rest.

270
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,520
That's all?

271
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,920
Play less with your phone,

272
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,280
and the computer.

273
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Go to bed early.

274
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
This is what's called nerd.

275
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,440
Nothing special can be split out from his mouth.

276
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,440
Who's that?

277
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,640
Nonsense!

278
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,480
They went too far.

279
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
What are you reading?

280
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,440
Why are you back so soon?

281
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,160
Not suitable for children.

282
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,040
You got quite unique tastes.

283
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm so furious.

284
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,840
What a waste of night.

285
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,680
What happened?

286
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,040
A insensitive man like Qin Shen

287
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,960
is really hopeless.

288
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,960
I asked him for dinner to test him.

289
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,960
What to test?

290
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,640
To test how he got on the throne of a learner god.

291
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,400
Yuan Qian.

292
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,960
Yuan Qian. You cheated!

293
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,560
Yuan Qian. Don't be mad.

294
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,200
These are all boring people.

295
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,640
Don't care about them.

296
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
Who says I have a messy private life?

297
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
I have many boyfriends?

298
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,840
Where are them?

299
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
Why nobody's here?

300
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,720
Exactly.

301
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,360
This person is mentally sick.

302
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,600
We were all angry when we saw it.

303
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,840
We were worried you would be uncomfortable if you see it.

304
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,560
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

305
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,286
- Don't get angry. - Don't.

306
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,600
It's okay.

307
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,280
Don't get angry.

308
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,720
What happened to the three of you?

309
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,960
I can hear your voice in the corridor.

310
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,760
Someone's talking nonsense on the Internet

311
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
that Yuan Qian has a messy private life

312
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
and has several boyfriends at the same time.

313
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,040
It became a buzz with the hot comments of Song Siyi's fans.

314
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,400
People are all scolding Yuan Qian on the Internet now.

315
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,400
Yes, this person is so disgusting.

316
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,196
In addition to slandering others in Weibo comments,

317
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,440
she also posted it to school forums to make herself popular.

318
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,760
Exactly. Look what is written.

319
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,720
I am furious.

320
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,200
It's okay, Yuan Qian.

321
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,160
We are all your strong support.

322
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,680
Don't worry.

323
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,120
I will scold back tomorrow for you.

324
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,120
Don't be angry.

325
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,760
Don't be angry.

326
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
I will get you some water.

327
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,320
What's wrong with you? You look serious.

328
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:47,000
You've been checking computer as you're back.

329
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What's the urgent?

330
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,240
This girl from our school is called Yuan Qian.

331
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Song Siyi is not her only boyfriend.

332
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Her private life is a mess.

333
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,600
What is this?

334
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,520
What a nonsense!

335
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,160
Who did that? Boring people!

336
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,440
Let me see.

337
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
They must have nothing else to do.

338
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,360
Don't worry. A clean hand needs no washing.

339
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,760
Don't care about these.

340
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
It's all fake. Don't worry about it.

341
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,280
Come on.

342
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,560
Song Siyi.

343
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,080
Coach, what's wrong?

344
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,920
What's going on?

345
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,760
When the girl bandaged your wound several days ago,

346
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,760
it happened to be photographed by your fan.

347
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
And then she posted it on Weibo.

348
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,040
Everyone

349
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,960
mistook she as your girlfriend.

350
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,972
But the company has already clarified it for you.

351
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,520
Listen, coach.

352
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,520
Why are people scolding Yuan Qian?

353
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,120
She just helped me deal with the wound.

354
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,880
Why does it have to do with a messy private life?

355
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,560
People nowadays have rich imagination.

356
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,520
It has nothing to do with you.

357
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,920
The company has dealt with this matter.

358
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,200
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

359
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,360
She was involved because of me.

360
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,196
Shouldn't the company find the one spread the rumors

361
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
and prove her innocence?

362
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,080
This is a problem for her,

363
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,200
not you.

364
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,400
So the company has no obligation for her.

365
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,520
Your priority now

366
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,720
is to train hard.

367
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,160
Don't think about these love affairs.

368
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,120
All of this happened because of me.

369
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,080
So the company has already clarified it for you.

370
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,720
This is her problem.

371
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,480
Her own business.

372
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,520
So the company won't take care of it, right?

373
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,520
Yes.

374
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,120
Then I will.

375
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,320
You!

376
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,320
You saw it?

377
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,320
Are you okay?

378
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
I'm as alright as I look.

379
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,480
I just wonder who did it.

380
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,120
Hello.

381
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,480
Yuan Qian, I am sorry.

382
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,640
Why?

383
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,680
I have seen rumors on the Internet.

384
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,160
You did this?

385
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,120
How could I post this kind of thing?

386
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,720
Then why did you apologize?

387
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,760
It happened because of me.

388
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,440
Why did you take others' faults on you?

389
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,200
Then think about how to compensate me.

390
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,280
I will sacrifice myself

391
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,920
to be your real boyfriend.

392
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Is this compensation or revenge?

393
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,960
Don't, I can't afford it.

394
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,120
Even if you agree, I have to consider it.

395
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,440
They're just some boring people.

396
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't be affected.

397
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,840
I will find the rumormongers

398
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
and prove your innocence.

399
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank you.

400
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,160
But I want to solve this problem myself.

401
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,600
Prepare for the game.

402
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,880
I have to go.

403
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,160
What are you going to do?

404
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,800
Check the URL first.

405
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,680
I can help you.

406
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,240
Please don't.

407
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,520
I can handle this by myself.

408
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,000
Wish you success.

409
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,520
The webmaster's office should be here.

410
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,360
I just don't know if he can check the website.

411
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,680
Why are you here?

412
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,840
I came for the webmaster.

413
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160
Why are you here?

414
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,240
Anyone in there?

415
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm asking something for my roommate. But no one's here.

416
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,920
Really?

417
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,840
It's true.

418
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,920
By the way,

419
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,280
something should be corrected

420
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,920
in your last interview draft.

421
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,480
I mentioned it to your senior.

422
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,000
She asked me to talk to you.

423
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,040
Let's talk another day. I'm occupied.

424
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I am have time now.

425
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,840
I'm usually tied up.

426
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,800
I won't have time another day.

427
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,840
Song Siyi, did you do it on purpose?

428
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,560
If you don't have time, forget it.

429
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,080
What I thought was that

430
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,800
if I took the initiative to talk to you,

431
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,160
your senior wouldn't embarrass you because of me.

432
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,000
Since you don't have time,

433
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,880
you can only wait for the senior to talk to you.

434
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,840
All right. All right.

435
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
I have time.

436
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,600
I am free now.

437
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Ask whatever you want to know.

438
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,120
You can only threaten me.

439
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,560
Let's go.

440
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,520
Are we going to stand here and talk?

441
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,920
Why are you so sneaky?

442
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,400
Tell me if you want to see it.

443
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,480
I'm just curious.

444
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,840
Have you found out who did it?

445
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,880
I am ready to report.

446
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,360
Is that necessary?

447
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,080
Don't be so fussy.

448
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
This is not just a personal matter,

449
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,840
it also involves the reputation of the school.

450
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,120
Will she be expelled from school?

451
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,080
What do you think?

452
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,400
Yi Ming.

453
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,120
Do you know the story behind?

454
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,640
Not at all.

455
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,600
I have no idea.

456
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,510
You were filled with righteous indignation at first.

457
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,280
But you're silent the next second.

458
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Do you recognize those accounts?

459
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,040
Qin.

460
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,480
Sorry.

461
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,520
I posted it.

462
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,080
It has nothing to do with others.

463
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,880
If you sent it, why didn't you know?

464
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,920
Qin, it was indeed me.

465
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,880
I happened to have Xue Congyang's phone that day.

466
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,800
It was her.

467
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,400
The webmaster just told me

468
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,000
it was the website of the girls' dormitory.

469
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,240
Qin, you played me.

470
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,880
Xue Congyang has already talked to you?

471
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,760
Not yet.

472
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,240
Sorry.

473
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,480
The number you dialed is busy now.

474
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,640
Please try again later.

475
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,440
What did Yuan Qian do to you?

476
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,720
Why did you hurt her?

477
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,000
It wasn't me.

478
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,520
Then what about those accounts?

479
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,840
I've checked them.

480
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
they are my fan club accounts.

481
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,400
My company told me that

482
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,240
you are in charge of these accounts.

483
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,080
The school's webmaster told me

484
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
the URLs of these accounts

485
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,000
belonged to the girl's dorm of Bowen Court.

486
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,080
If it's not you, who else can it be?

487
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,440
I don't know.

488
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,120
I was not the only one in charge of those accounts.

489
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,720
Even if it was done by someone else,

490
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
it would never happen that

491
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
you are all in the same building.

492
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,120
I really have no idea.

493
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,520
Yuan Qian is my best friend.

494
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,000
How could I hurt her?

495
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,000
Then why did you join my fan club?

496
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,600
I…

497
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,560
I…

498
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
I don't know why you did this.

499
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,760
But if you still regard Yuan Qian as your friend,

500
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,400
please apologize publicly

501
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,800
and clarify this matter.

502
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,720
Let's talk.

503
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
I believe you did not do it.

504
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,040
But I want to know the details.

505
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,080
I really know nothing about it.

506
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,720
I believe you won't hurt Yuan Qian.

507
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,880
But the information was indeed sent from your account.

508
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,200
I don't know why.

509
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,880
I joined the fan club

510
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,320
only because I like Song Siyi.

511
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,280
One-sided.

512
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,600
Does anyone else know?

513
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,440
They all said they never did it.

514
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,960
The account that broke the news was originally shared by us.

515
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,960
But now the password has been changed.

516
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,760
I don't know who did it.

517
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,760
So I can't help Yuan Qian to clarify it.

518
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,960
Hello, here is your takeaway.

519
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,520
Qin. Dinner time.

520
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,800
Thank you.

521
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,240
You have been staring at the computer all afternoon.

522
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,240
You said you have no interests in girls.

523
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,880
Why did you start researching girls' homepages?

524
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,320
Qin.

525
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,240
Did I got it wrong?

526
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,040
The person you like is not Yuan Qian

527
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,320
but Ling Wei?

528
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,360
Ling Wei?

529
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,080
Isn't that Ling Wei?

530
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
That is the backstage photo of Ling Wei and Dai Yaqing

531
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,000
when they were in a dance competition.

532
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,680
I've seen it from Dai Yaqing.

533
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,320
Is this Ling Wei's account?

534
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,600
Sorry, sir.

535
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,680
Are you busy with something?

536
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,880
You don't take classes seriously

537
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,800
and didn't grasp the opportunity that goes to you.

538
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,520
What happened to you?

539
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,720
I'm sorry.

540
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,520
I promise I won't be next time.

541
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,680
Anything wrong?

542
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,160
No big deal. Just trivial matters.

543
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,520
Qin really cares about you.

544
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,160
He's late for class just to find out the rumormonger for you.

545
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,440
He is the zero record holder

546
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,061
for being late, leaving early and asking for a leave.

547
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,560
Except the last time he poured soy milk.

548
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,000
He is finding out the rumormonger for me?

549
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,292
Madam, one beef noodles please.

550
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,880
Thank you.

551
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,400
Madam.

552
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,960
The same for me.

553
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,240
Sorry.

554
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,600
It's the last one.

555
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,400
You're selling out so soon.

556
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,480
Thank you.

557
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,040
Excuse me. Let me add vinegar.

558
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,680
How did I offend you again?

559
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,240
Not at all.

560
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,520
Hold it.

561
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,920
Isn't it for yourself?

562
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,415
You don't want it?

563
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Surely I do.

564
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,680
Why did you give me the beef noodles?

565
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,480
You robbed me.

566
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,680
Obviously you gave it to me.

567
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
You were late for classes

568
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,787
because you were trying to help me, right?

569
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,480
Who said it?

570
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,200
Just tell me yes or no.

571
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,480
No.

572
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,440
You are going to learn computer by yourself,

573
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,760
why do I have to help you?

574
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,720
It sounds you got a brush-off.

575
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,160
You are uncomfortable

576
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,560
because I didn't accept your help.

577
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,520
Right?

578
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,440
How did you draw the conclusion?

579
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,560
Just say yes or no.

580
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,600
Is it that difficult?

581
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,000
Yuan Qian.

582
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,040
Good timing.

583
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,200
Ling Wei, you're here to have lunch?

584
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,080
Yuan Qian.

585
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,920
I heard the rumors these days.

586
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
Are you okay?

587
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,520
I am okay.

588
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,600
I didn't care about this little thing.

589
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,640
It's good you are fine.

590
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,080
I'm so worried.

591
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:20,920
Hello.

592
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,760
Why did you go for the webmaster again?

593
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
You have been there several times.

594
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,880
He didn't tell the truth.

595
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,440
He said it now?

596
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,480
Yes.

597
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,040
Who did it?

598
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,960
I have to go.

599
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,080
You said that you are not helping me, right?

600
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,120
Are you here for the webmaster?

601
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,080
Yes.

602
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,480
I'm helping.

603
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Show me your gratitude.

604
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,720
How?

605
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,360
Treat me a lunch.

606
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,640
Qin Shen won't ask for this.

607
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,400
Are you anyone else?

608
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,760
I am definitely real.

609
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,520
You haven't settled it for me.

610
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,760
I must know who it is

611
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,120
before I invite you to lunch.

612
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,178
I'm going for the webmaster to confirm something.

613
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,400
Once you find out who it is,

614
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,680
it will not be solved by one meal.

615
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,960
You!

616
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,600
Thank you.

617
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,209
You are welcome.

618
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,880
Do you have some conspiracies

619
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,126
to prevent me from contacting the webmaster?

620
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,800
Song Siyi is from our dormitory.

621
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I know everything.

622
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,000
He

623
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,400
was deceived by Yuan Qian's appearance.

624
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,080
He has long been cuckolded.

625
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,600
Song Siyi likes to brag about himself.

626
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,280
Yet he has a bad taste for women.

627
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,600
Yuan Qian

628
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,480
has cheated many times.

629
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,040
Really?

630
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,840
Song Siyi is so stupid this time.

631
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,760
You wait here.

632
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,080
Let me check if the dishes are ready.

633
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,640
Okay.

634
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,360
What's wrong with you?

635
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,960
You spread my rumor

636
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,080
and stepped on my foot.

637
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,240
I spread rumor?

638
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,600
Aren't you eating with other man?

639
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,920
Could you behave yourself as a woman?

640
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,160
I am single.

641
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,960
And I didn't do anything against morality.

642
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,280
Look at you.

643
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,120
Talking about bullshit without any proof.

644
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,880
Shouldn't you wash your mouth

645
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,360
that made rumors and troubles?

646
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,080
If Song Siyi has something to say,

647
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,320
let him come to Yuan Qian himself.

648
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,760
Let the dog bite people casually

649
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,120
is against the rule.

650
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,520
Who's dog?

651
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,120
Who's dog?

652
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,240
Qin Shen, right?

653
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,320
I'll remember you.

654
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,120
Don't leave!

655
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,160
Come back.

656
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,760
Enough. Enough.

657
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,640
Who is the dog?

658
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,600
Make it clear!

659
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,920
Come back.

660
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,840
Thank you.

661
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,640
He wanted to beat you. Why didn't you evade?

662
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,520
That's because…

663
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,080
That's because you are by my side.

664
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,800
What?

665
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,200
Nothing.

666
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,880
Nothing.

667
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,360
Yuan Qian.

668
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,560
Are you okay?

669
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,840
Did Cheng Hao hurt you?

670
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,160
I am okay.

671
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
But he was splashed all over by me.

672
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,000
That's good.

673
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:43,800
By the way,

674
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,880
I have to tell you something.

675
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,600
I have some clues about the rumor.

676
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,400
Really?

677
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,440
You go first.

678
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,600
Why? I want to know the clues.

679
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,560
What he found is wrong.

680
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,920
I have confirmed.

681
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,320
How do you know what I found is wrong?

682
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,280
You want to say Xue Congyang, right?

683
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:03,378
It couldn't be Xue Congyang. Don't talk nonsense.

684
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
If you want to say it is Xue Congyang,

685
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:05,560
I won't listen to you.

686
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,040
I have to go.

687
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,480
You helped her when Cheng Hao made trouble today?

688
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,960
I was willing to.

689
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,040
Xue Congyang won't hurt Yuan Qian.

690
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,680
She joined your fan club

691
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,400
is just from a pure girl's mind.

692
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,240
What is it?

693
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,720
Think it yourself.

694
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,160
I feel that Qin Shen is hiding something from me.

695
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,680
Otherwise he won't stop me to find the webmaster

696
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,040
to confirm the URL.

697
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,640
Is it someone around me?

698
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,560
Yuan Qian.

699
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,600
Why're you checking Dai Yaqing's account?

700
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,400
Dai Yaqing?

701
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,320
Every time she is on duty, she uses these accounts to post comments.

702
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
It's useless to talk to her.

703
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,600
Qin Shen.

704
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,840
Why are you here?

705
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,760
I am looking for you.

706
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,240
What's up?

707
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,120
Did you post the content that defamed Yuan Qian?

708
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,120
It wasn't me.

709
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,960
How can you say that to me?

710
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,400
It's all clearly written.

711
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,880
This is exactly the URL of your dorm.

712
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,240
It was not me.

713
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Yuan Qian is my friend.

714
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,280
And I don't have a Weibo account at all.

715
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,400
Then who did this?

716
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,720
I have no idea.

717
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,640
You seem to know the story.

718
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,040
I don't!

719
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,756
It doesn't matter if you don't say it.

720
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,000
No matter who did this,

721
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,680
if she doesn't come out to clarify and apologize,

722
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,000
I will publish the information.

723
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,280
At that time,

724
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,920
she will be at her own risk.

725
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
It was really not me.

726
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,840
Trust me.

727
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,240
Yuan Qian is my friend.

728
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,320
It also hurts me to see her like this.

729
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
And I don't do this kind of stuff

730
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,400
like stabbing a friend in the back.

731
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,520
It'd better not you.

732
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,680
Don't cover others, either.

733
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,560
Those who study sculpture are troublesome.

734
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,120
If the ground is wet,

735
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,649
there is nowhere to hide the mud footprints.

736
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,320
It was really not me.

737
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:22,840
Yuan Qian.

738
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,720
Why are you unhappy?

739
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,840
It's late. So you've just finished training?

740
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,160
What happened to you?

741
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,400
I won't ask

742
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,560
if you don't want to say.

743
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,680
Thank you.

744
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,120
Come here.

745
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,440
If you feel sad, just cry.

746
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,760
I... I didn't mean to wait for you here.

747
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,920
I…

748
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,040
I just happened to pass by.

749
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,520
Don't think too much.

750
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,120
And don't…

751
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
Forget it. I have to go.

752
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,840
Bye.

753
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,720
What do you want?

754
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,680
Piss off.

755
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,233
What is the relationship between you and Song Siyi?

756
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,480
It's none of your business.

757
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,360
He hugs you and you just accept it?

758
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,640
Didn't Ling Wei hug you, too?

759
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,800
Didn't you accept it, too?
