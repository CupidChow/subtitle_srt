1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 14

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,320
Tired?

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm okay.

5
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,440
Actually, I...

6
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
That's great.

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
There're loads in the bush there.

8
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,600
It may affect the shoots later.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,960
Let's clean it up together.

10
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,920
My goodness.

11
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
Qin, you've got make up on?

12
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,760
It's a pity Yuan Qian wasn't around.

13
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,702
Otherwise she would surely be mesmerized by you.

14
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,000
She was there.

15
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,680
It can't be?

16
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
She went there for you?

17
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,640
No, it wasn't.

18
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,480
For Song Siyi?

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,320
My survival instincts tell me that

20
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,640
I'm not finished brushing my teeth.

21
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
Qin, I have to go back to finish it.

22
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,120
Yuan Qian,

23
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,440
where did you go?

24
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,720
You're stinking of sweat.

25
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,525
For the shooting of the promotional film.

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,880
Isn't Qin Shen the representative for our class?

27
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Yes.

28
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,440
I was just there to do chores.

29
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,280
Moreover, I was treated like a labourer.

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,600
I'm so tired that I could die now.

31
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,360
You... what are you doing?

32
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,600
You're running away from home?

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm going orienteering.

34
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,240
It's overnight. I'm packing my things.

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,480
Yuan Qian,

36
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,280
I feel that you're shrouding by a dark smoke,

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,600
a flammable smoke.

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,280
You're right.

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,200
It's the kind that's going to explode.

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
Perhaps, you don't feel like going orienteering?

41
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,640
Are you tired?

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,480
No, I'm just being upset

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,960
that I had a bad vision these days.

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
I should visit an optician.

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,240
You're of the best eyesight.

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,640
My eyesight's pretty good,

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
but I can't judge people well.

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
It was all one-sided.

49
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Be quick.

50
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,400
Let's go.

51
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,920
Yi Ming, sit by yourself.

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
Behave yourself.

53
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,840
Brother, could you please post photos appropriately?

54
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,440
I'm afraid that your fans will "kill" me.

55
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm still so young.

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
Please, do me a favour.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
Let me live a little longer.

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,280
It's fine.

59
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,480
I'll protect you.

60
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,920
I'll thank god if you don't cause my "death".

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
Are you afraid that someone will be unhappy about the photos,

62
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,720
so you want me to delete them?

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
No, I'm not.

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,960
Don't delete it then.

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,200
The sun's too bright.

66
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,160
Draw the curtains. You'll be able to sleep that way.

67
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
A cold drink for you?

68
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Okay.

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,920
Have this one.

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,360
Here you are.

71
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
He's a skilled one.

72
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,360
Qin, look at this.

73
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,377
They're already acting like this.

74
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,280
What are you going to do?

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,640
Ready to stay single for life?

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Shut up. I want to sleep.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,920
Everybody here?

78
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
Sir, we're ready to go.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,640
My mates,

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,000
the BBQ pit, camping lights and tents

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,320
are ready.

82
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Now, let's split into teams.

83
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,920
The teams you form now

84
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,200
will last the same for tonight's games

85
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
and tomorrow's orienteering.

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,040
Teacher, can we choose our teams?

87
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, you can.

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,800
You can mix genders.

89
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,177
Discuss it yourselves.

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,280
Let me know once you've confirmed your teams.

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,960
This person isn't reliable.

92
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,840
Teaming up with a muscular man like Yi Ming,

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,360
that's reliable. We might even win.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Do I match your requirements?

95
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
You do. You're a good match.

96
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Qin Shen, could you be my teammate?

97
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,560
Teacher.

98
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,320
Teacher, me and...

99
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
Yuan Qian, Qin Shen.

100
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,400
Alright.

101
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,200
Qin, you...

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
You, note down the teams and scores.

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
I had a team at first.

104
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,560
Ling Wei.

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,760
Only you and Song Siyi doesn't have a team.

106
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,920
Teacher, could we...

107
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,920
Yi Ming, you're shameless.

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,360
You want to form a team with Ling Wei?

109
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
I want to team up with Song Siyi.

110
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
We'll be a strong alliance

111
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,720
and defeat you all.

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,880
That's enough.

113
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
Just be the scribe.

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,600
They'll team up.

115
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,600
You're strong. You can help me carrying equipments.

116
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,320
Come on, gather around here.

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,840
Alright.

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,400
Bring your tents over.

119
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,280
Why do you want to team up with me?

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,720
Your calves look strong.

121
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,360
You can probably walk a lot.

122
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,800
This is a competition that concerns your pride.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
The first two teams to finish their tents won't need to cook.

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
Show me your speed.

125
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,880
Are you ready?

126
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
Yes! We're ready!

127
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,440
Three, two, one.

128
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,040
Come on!

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,680
Lay out the inner tent first.

130
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,880
Then place the poles across the top.

131
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,840
Connect the parts of the poles,

132
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,560
then attach the poles to the hooks.

133
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Come on, Qin!

134
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,440
Put the outer layer on top.

135
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,240
Remember, the outer layer must align with the inner one,

136
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,337
doors should on the same side.

137
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,240
We're done.

138
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,400
We already have the first team.

139
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,120
We're done too.

140
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,360
Alright.

141
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
The streaky pork looks great.

142
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,720
That's for sure.

143
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
Here're some meat for you guys.

144
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Did you go coal mining?

145
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,840
You look too funny now.

146
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,040
I thought the 2nd team didn't need to work.

147
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
In the end, we're doing all the dirty chores.

148
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,268
I can guarantee you that

149
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,280
teacher said that the top two didn't need to cook,

150
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
not that you didn't have to do chores.

151
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,360
So,

152
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,040
you're not cooking now.

153
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,800
Qin is too straight

154
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,240
to let you do these chores.

155
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,920
I'll make the fire. You go move the charcoal.

156
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,680
Qin,

157
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,840
you're letting a girl to move the heavy things?

158
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,160
Then, what should she do?

159
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,640
Our dear little Yuan,

160
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,400
just needs to look pretty, that's all.

161
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,600
I should just help him.

162
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,960
You should wash up first.

163
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,640
You really want me to just look pretty and do nothing?

164
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,320
You do look pretty ugly now.

165
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,080
Yuan Qian, you hungry?

166
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,400
A little bit. It's getting late.

167
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,760
Cucumbers can be eaten raw.

168
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,680
Have some for now.

169
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,560
Thank you.

170
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,840
Yuan Qian.

171
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,760
What?

172
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,440
The charcoal's turning red.

173
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,680
Once it's all red, we can start cooking.

174
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,280
Why did you ask me here?

175
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,920
Are you doing it on purpose?

176
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,840
You want me to stand beside to smell the smoke?

177
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,400
The smoke goes wherever I stand.

178
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,480
What are you doing?

179
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
I can't control the wind.

180
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,280
I guess our horoscopes really don't match.

181
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not good to be superstitious.

182
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,480
I should have teamed up with Yi Ming.

183
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,040
That way, we would've won.

184
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,080
You're not going to cook?

185
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
My team was the first one in tent pitching.

186
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,720
We don't need to cook. Do you need help?

187
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,342
You can make the fire then.

188
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,280
Alright.

189
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,480
What meat is this?

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,160
Done with the interview report?

191
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm still eating.

192
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,720
Don't talk about the unhappy things.

193
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
If I lose my appetite,

194
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,160
I might take revenge on you.

195
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
We obviously have many

196
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,640
beautiful memories.

197
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,440
How can you say it's unhappy?

198
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,280
I just wanted to know if you wrote anything untruthful.

199
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,480
I've submitted the report.

200
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,840
You'll probably see it soon.

201
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,760
You can have a look if you want to.

202
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,440
I am a professional.

203
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,920
Don't question my professionalism.

204
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,120
Not bad. I'm quite satisfied.

205
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,480
Wipe your mouth.

206
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,560
Don't look at me that way.

207
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm eating so much

208
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,120
because I don't want waste our classmates' efforts.

209
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,200
If I eat happily,

210
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,160
they'll cook happily, too.

211
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,800
Of course.

212
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,560
I understand it well

213
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,560
on the thoughts of those who raise pigs.

214
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,240
You're a pig.

215
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,000
See, you're out of hands right now.

216
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,680
You've worked hard.

217
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,080
This is the dinner.

218
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,720
Have some more.

219
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,880
It's just barbecue meat.

220
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,120
You want to give it back to me?

221
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,880
Teacher Li was looking for me.

222
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,680
I need to go.

223
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,720
Did...did a lot of people bathe here?

224
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,120
Yuan Qian.

225
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,160
What are you doing?

226
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
You can turn around.

227
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,360
No, I won't.

228
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,920
Am I that sort of person?

229
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,560
Gather around.

230
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,240
Let me brief everyone the schedule for today.

231
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,320
We'll give out the maps to everyone later.

232
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,200
Familiarize yourselves with the map,

233
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,200
and the rules of the game, then set off.

234
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,280
Remember.

235
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,320
Be sure to pack enough water and food.

236
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,520
Because we'll may get back to school at 7 or 8pm.

237
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,560
We'll only release you for dinner when we get back.

238
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,600
What time it will be?

239
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,280
- 7 or 8 pm? - That's too late. - We'll be starving.

240
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,960
Let me explain the rules.

241
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,800
I'll only say it once.

242
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,360
Listen up.

243
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,880
Looking at the map,

244
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
we see nine flags.

245
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,680
Each flag worth different points.

246
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,520
Of course,

247
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,680
different points

248
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,960
means different difficulties, too.

249
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,760
The back page of the map

250
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,520
has 9 boxes

251
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,200
that match the flags relatively.

252
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,920
Line three of them up horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

253
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,080
Just form a straight line with three boxes

254
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,320
and your mission's accomplished.

255
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,360
Then you'll get a prize.

256
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,480
You got that?

257
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,320
Got it.

258
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
Then, how do we do with

259
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,760
the different points?

260
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,640
If everyone completes the mission,

261
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,320
the team with the highest score

262
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,400
will receive a mystery prize.

263
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,720
A mystery prize?

264
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,720
A mystery prize?

265
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,720
Alright, everyone, stay safe.

266
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
Ensure your phones are connected.

267
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,800
Dismissed.

268
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,840
Let's go. Come on.

269
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,680
Get your stuff.

270
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
One compass each.

271
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,080
One map each.

272
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
What are you looking at?

273
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,560
I... I'm looking at that tree.

274
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,800
It looks great.

275
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,280
The competition's started.

276
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,080
What are you waiting for?

277
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,480
Let's... Let's go.

278
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,400
Here are the wet towels.

279
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,520
Here.

280
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Qin, do your best.

281
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,840
Yuan Qian,

282
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,320
stay safe when climbing the mountains.

283
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,480
We're in the wilderness after all.

284
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,400
You must be careful.

285
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,400
If you need anything,

286
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
remember to call me.

287
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,360
You stay safe, too.

288
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,600
Here.

289
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,000
What are you doing?

290
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,600
You're using the whole pack by yourself?

291
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,200
I have a big face.

292
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,800
Let's go.

293
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,720
That's a big face?

294
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,720
Your short legs won't make it across.

295
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,840
I'll go get the flag first.

296
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,120
You're the one with short legs.

297
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,320
He's a physical teacher.

298
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,760
But he couldn't be considerate of our girls.

299
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,560
Qin Shen, why don't you waiting for me?

300
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
There's no use waiting for you.

301
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,000
I'll go get the flag first.

302
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,600
Just wait me here.

303
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,920
I can do it.

304
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,800
You... just wait and see.

305
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,600
I'll fly there.

306
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,000
We, fairies, can fly.

307
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,480
Help me out.

308
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,560
You...

309
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,960
turn the other way round.

310
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,120
What? You want to take a nap here?

311
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,040
Haven't you done?

312
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,400
Didn't I ask you to turn the other way round?

313
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,200
Why'd you turn back?

314
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,720
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

315
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
We're even now.

316
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,280
Then, what do we do now?

317
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,280
Wear this.

318
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,880
I'm done.

319
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,800
We're toasted. We're art students.

320
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,240
Mathematics is our weakness.

321
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,080
Let's go to another one.

322
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,520
We'll do the math.

323
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
You're wasting time here.

324
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,720
If we can't get the flag here,

325
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,760
this means we're wasting time for other flags.

326
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,560
You want to see me react?

327
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,040
We'll get it for sure.

328
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,640
This is difficult.

329
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,560
See, nobody could solve it.

330
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,040
Can you really do it?

331
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,880
I can.

332
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,000
Come on, hold my bag for me.

333
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,200
The code has 3 digits.

334
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,000
You got it yet?

335
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,840
252.

336
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,880
What?

337
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,560
How'd you get it?

338
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,560
252.

339
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,280
You got it?

340
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,600
Open the chest first.

341
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,960
It's opened! It's opened!

342
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,680
It's really opened!

343
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,120
I got it!

344
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
You're doing great.

345
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,040
Where shall we go next?

346
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,360
Didn't you say that you'll decide it?

347
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,400
Let's follow your lead.

348
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,840
Let's go, to the next spot.

349
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,160
The site for flag should be nearby.

350
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,320
Why can't we find it?

351
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,440
We'll reach the other 500 more meters.

352
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,600
Be careful!

353
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,200
Don't say anything

354
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,000
if you can't say four words in one go.

355
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,360
You've already said, "be careful",

356
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,080
couldn't you have mentioned the stone?

357
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,040
Usually,

358
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,640
people hear that warning

359
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,960
would stop moving.

360
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,160
You okay?

361
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm not.

362
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,920
To an unusual person like me,

363
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,720
you should have just told me to stop moving.

364
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,360
Don't move.

365
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,120
It's twisted.

366
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,480
Seems to be.

367
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,080
You can just go for the site.

368
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,760
Let's complete the mission first.

369
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,760
Just leave me here.

370
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,320
Take the phone.

371
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,520
What are you doing?

372
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,520
I won't abandon my teammate.

373
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,120
Carry this.

374
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,280
Hold it tight if you don't want to fall.

375
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,360
Take out the map.

376
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,680
Alright, you can keep it.

377
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,480
We won't win like this, right?

378
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,800
It's okay.

379
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,680
Don't you feel regretful?

380
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,080
If you had teamed up with someone else,

381
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,760
you could have won.

382
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,840
But because of me, you can't win now.

383
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,360
I haven't expected to win as I teamed up with you.

384
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,760
Then, why did you insist on teaming up with me?

385
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
I was misled by your shank muscles.

386
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,040
I didn't asked.

387
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,160
We took a long detour.

388
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,560
We should've made the turn earlier.

389
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,000
We took such a long detour.

390
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,280
Do you know your bag is heavy?

391
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,920
My arm's about to break.

392
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,440
Could my bag be heavier than you?

393
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,000
On account that you still have to carry me back,

394
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,120
I won't scold you for now.

395
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,800
Why did you bring me here?

396
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,600
Brother, what's so interesting about

397
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,840
an imperfect mushroom?

398
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,360
We made such a long detour.

399
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,160
If we didn't detour,

400
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,120
we would've been back.

401
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,600
You sure, you won't take a picture?

402
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,200
Don't you find it special?

403
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,520
God Qin,

404
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,640
if we don't return now, I have to amputate my leg.

405
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,880
Let's go back, alright?

406
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,640
Am I straight guy?

407
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,920
Why are you asking me this?

408
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,040
You should ask yourself.

409
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,600
Didn't you say that

410
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,640
I'm an insensitive and straight guy?

411
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,400
That's true.

412
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,240
I think you're pretty straight, too.

413
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,520
Why?

414
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,240
Figure it yourself.

415
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,800
- You're too slow. - We've been searched for long.

416
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,240
Where's Yuan Qian?

417
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,520
We went to quite a few checkpoints

418
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,920
and got many flags.

419
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,920
What about you guys?

420
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,400
Did you complete the mission?

421
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,800
Teacher, it's done.

422
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,440
Our winning team

423
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,560
is Song Siyi and Ling Wei.

424
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,400
Wow.

425
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,880
Still hurts?

426
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,400
It's not that hurts actually.

427
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,720
That's great.

428
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,320
We've ran around the whole day,

429
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,960
yet we didn't get anything.

430
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,640
That's too lousy.

431
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,760
Why did you take a rock out?

432
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,520
It's a souvenir for you.

433
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,920
Could you change it into a smaller one?

434
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,680
I'm tired for running around the whole day.

435
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,680
I don't want to carry back

436
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,760
such a big souvenir.

437
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,480
This is the rock that you tripped on.

438
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,840
It proves your hard work today.

439
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,400
Be careful.

440
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,480
What?

441
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,240
You carried such a huge rock the entire day?

442
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
You carried it. I carried you.
