1
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,970
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,040
Episode 13

3
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,120
What's wrong?

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you worrying that

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
it would be embarrassed

6
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
if you can't be the No.1 next time,

7
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,800
since you got it last time?

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,560
I was fooling around.

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,280
Don't push your luck.

10
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,960
You got the No.1 by fooling around?

11
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Let alone me,

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,800
doesn't Qin Shen worth your attention?

13
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,080
It's him who made it.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,920
He twisted it

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
and broke the neck.

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
Why did he break your neck?

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,480
My neck?

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,720
It's the swan's neck.

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,720
It's meant to be two swans crossing necks.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
But the neck wouldn't stand,

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,240
and I asked him for help.

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,560
It's not the result I expected.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,920
It's the power of the anger

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,800
from a single man.

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm the one who should be angry.

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,760
He killed my cob,

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,840
but the work won the first place!

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,080
It's an insult to my efforts

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
on erecting the neck for 1 hour.

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,000
That's a bit excessive.

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,000
He won the first place for you.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
I watched his move

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
and I was convinced he would help me.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,680
But after only several words,

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,440
he just snapped the neck.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,120
I think he's going through menopause.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
What did you say?

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
You know Song Siyi won the race, right?

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,760
And there is some whatnot in his acceptance speech.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Qin Shen asked me

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
if I work part-time for Song Siyi.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
I said yes.

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Was he being jealous?

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,880
Jealous?

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
For what?

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,400
Think about it.

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,520
He planned to help you,

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,760
but he found out that you did it for Song.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,000
He might think

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
the swans represent you and Song.

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
He got jealous. And snap!

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,480
He broke Song Siyi's neck.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,000
He acts like a boss.

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,960
What a beautiful love!

55
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,640
It's highly impossible

56
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
that he could get jealous.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,080
Trust me!

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
I can smell the jealousy from here.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,840
Hello.

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,040
Yuan Qian. I'm at school now.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
Let's get dinner together.

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,560
I have plans for tonight.

63
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,800
Don't worry. I will make time

64
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,360
for celebrating your winning the game.

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,880
OK. As long as you remember it.

66
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,320
You're rejected?

67
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
She said she has plans,

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,600
and she'll make it next time.

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,680
You believe in everything.

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
She will keep her words.

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,320
Come on. Get changed and let's go.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
There's no training today.

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,160
I feel uncomfortable all over without some sports.

74
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:26,928
Qin Shen

75
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,160
What's up?

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
You're playing?

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,240
Yeah.

78
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
I have something to ask you.

79
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
Can I see you now?

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,480
OK.

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
I'll wait you at the ground.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,480
Let's go.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,480
I need a break.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,760
You're having a break?

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
What's up?

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,080
Why are you standing? Come on.

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,960
Look.

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,080
Over there.

89
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,760
Is it because of Qin Shen

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,000
that Yuan Qian said no to you?

91
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,120
No.

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,200
I was just thinking about my swan's neck,

93
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,520
and I want to talk to you about it.

94
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,920
I want to know

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
why did you break

96
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
the neck of the cob.

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,960
Is it because that you like...?

98
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,520
It's OK.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,400
It can't hit me,

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,640
because I'm too short.

101
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,680
If it went over, I have to get it.

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,200
They think they're in a romantic drama?

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,640
Go say hello.

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
Let's go if you don't want to.

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm done with it.

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,280
What were you saying?

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,920
I mean did you get a slip of hand

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,680
because you washed your hands?

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,720
I didn't wash my hands.

110
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,480
Never mind.

111
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,640
Attention. Attention.

112
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,960
Big news!

113
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,320
It's only me here.

114
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Voice down, please.

115
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
Only you are here?

116
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,840
You know what?

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,520
We're going to have a promotional video.

118
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,280
Each class should have an ambassador.

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,320
I think, with my face,

120
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,960
I can totally handle the job.

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
The technology is like magic now.

122
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,840
Even the video can be photoshoped?

123
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,120
You're just being envious of my beauty.

124
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,880
Right. Right. Right.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,880
I envy you.

127
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,480
I'm not in a good mood.

128
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,320
What's wrong?

129
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,920
The one in the club texted me

130
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,120
telling me to interview Song Siyi.

131
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,600
Why it has to be him?

132
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,240
You don't want that?

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
Dai Yaqing can't do that even she wants to.

134
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,720
She can go if she wants.

135
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,040
Song Siyi won't be happy about it.

136
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,160
You know that

137
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,920
he doesn't like being interviewed.

138
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,280
If it's not for him saying yes to your every request,

139
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,480
there won't be any report about him

140
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,680
on the school newspaper.

141
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
For promotion!

142
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,800
Where is he playing?

143
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,840
Why doesn't he pick up?

144
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,000
You're not paying any attention to him!

145
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
He just posted on the Moments

146
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,960
saying he was training by the lake.

147
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,400
Why do I have to pay attention to him?

148
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm not an innocent girl.

149
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,200
I'll go for him by the lake.

150
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,640
You want me?

151
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,840
Yeah.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,080
I said I would celebrate for you.

153
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,120
Come on. Let's have a meal.

154
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,440
What do you want? Just say it.

155
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
You won the game,

156
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,080
so I got a new mission.

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,160
Interviewing me?

158
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,520
Clever man.

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
Promise me one thing,

160
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,760
if you want to interview me.

161
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
You got a requirement for it?

162
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,440
I promise you to do the interview,

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,760
and you promise me one thing in return.

164
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,160
It's fair, isn't it?

165
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,800
Alright then. What do you want?

166
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
Being my assistant for a weak.

167
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,520
Assistant?

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,640
I am your boss.

169
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,960
Do you want to rebel?

170
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,880
What a nerve!

171
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,720
Alright.

172
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
I have to say no to your interview.

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,240
You got me.

174
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,080
You promise?

175
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,720
You won't be pleased for long.

176
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,400
You...

177
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,160
Qin. Yuan Qian.

178
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,120
Do you know about

179
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
the promotional video?

180
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,720
I think

181
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,680
it's like tailor made for me!

182
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,640
You and Luo Xinxin

183
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,720
are a perfect match.

184
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,320
She said also that she would make it

185
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,560
with her beautiful face.

186
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Luo Xinxin?

187
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,320
Is our school a weight loss camp?

188
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,040
She wants to be in the video for losing weight?

189
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,400
Who's that?

190
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,360
Chen Qinan.

191
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,480
You are a dead man!

192
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,400
Stop!

193
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
Don't run!

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,400
What did you want to say at the basketball court yesterday?

195
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
It's nothing. You won't get it, anyway.

196
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,880
Are you available tonight?

197
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,480
Being my assistant for a week.

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm not for every day recently.

199
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,720
You want to ask me out?

200
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
No. You're busy.

201
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Song Siyi.

202
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,960
Hello.

203
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,400
Why do you ask me here suddenly?

204
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,240
Song Siyi. You're having a good life.

205
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,160
You got girls accompanying you every day.

206
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,280
Go away.

207
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,160
I'm his assistant for this week.

208
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,120
Don't get it wrong.

209
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,440
Assistant?

210
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,240
I mean it.

211
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,880
I believe you.

212
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,240
Watch the clock for me.

213
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,400
Start it when I set off,

214
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,600
and end it when I arrive.

215
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,040
And then log the figure.

216
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,720
Don't you need three teammates?

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
Where are them?

218
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,880
I was in the team of four,

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
but I'm not in a team anymore.

220
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,040
You can just write down the time.

221
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,360
You're playing single scull now?

222
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,680
But this must be expensive.

223
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
I will sign a contract soon.

224
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,960
There are only some terms

225
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
we have to think about and amend.

226
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
And I have promised them

227
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,720
I will train for single scull.

228
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,560
So

229
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,360
they assigned a boat for me.

230
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,800
I see.

231
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,760
In order to protect you,

232
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,920
I told them I would practice at school

233
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,160
instead of the training camp.

234
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,360
I'm good to you, don't you think?

235
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
Please do it far away from me.

236
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,400
You don't mean it.

237
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,280
What about you?

238
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
Why are you always here?

239
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm deep in love with sculling.

240
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,760
So I'm here to watch.

241
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,040
You wouldn't understand.

242
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,880
We are like the same person

243
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,480
in chasing the sculling dream.

244
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
You...

245
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,880
Don't be too mushy.

246
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,360
Assistant. Ready to work.

247
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,960
What?

248
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,440
It's too hot today.

249
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,720
And I'm sore all over

250
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,240
after the training.

251
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
I need to relax.

252
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,400
Speak Chinese.

253
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,840
Mop me up and give me a massage.

254
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,440
Don't you think it's too much?

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,480
No man

256
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
would let a girl mop him up

257
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,400
and give him a massage

258
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,360
after she's been standing under the sun for hours.

259
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
Isn't there human rights?

260
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
If you don't want to do it,

261
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,680
I may forget all the things

262
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
about my winning the game.

263
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,000
Like how did I feel when I won,

264
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,360
how intensive was the response,

265
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,320
how excited were the audience,

266
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,880
how warm was the cheering,

267
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
the fragrance of the flowers,

268
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,040
and what I was thinking.

269
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,720
Ouch. Ouch.

270
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,080
You told me to do it.

271
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,600
If you can't stand it, do it yourself.

272
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Or you can ask someone else to do it.

273
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,800
I can stand it.

274
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,880
Come on.

275
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,440
Are we done?

276
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,800
And the massage?

277
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,840
Harder.

278
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,760
Good one!

279
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,200
Let's take a break.

280
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,560
Why are you here alone?

281
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,120
Aren't you always with Song Siyi?

282
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,440
He got a girl now.

283
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
How can he play with us?

284
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,400
Got a girl?

285
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,840
She is with him every day.

286
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,480
I've seen enough.

287
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,400
It's a torture to us singles.

288
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,520
Who is she?

289
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,200
Is she the girl from the sculpture department?

290
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,080
Who else can she be?

291
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Song Siyi is just stubborn.

292
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,040
But I guess he probably got her,

293
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,600
or she wouldn't train with him every day.

294
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,320
Makes sense.

295
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,120
Makes sense.

296
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,920
Qin Shen!

297
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,520
Why're you leaving?

298
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,760
This is how you celebrate for me?

299
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,680
At the cafeteria?

300
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,920
Just eat.

301
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,560
Even rice can't fill your mouth.

302
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,120
We just grab some food

303
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,600
after the interview.

304
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,120
None of my business.

305
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,640
You like him?

306
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,560
Of course not.

307
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,680
That's good.

308
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,560
Eat more. You still need to grow.

309
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,240
You should eat more since you're so small.

310
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,000
We looks good together with our heights.

311
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,880
Finally, I some me time.

312
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,720
It's so good to be free again.

313
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,000
The day after tomorrow is the last one.

314
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,880
It will be heave if I survive it.

315
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,600
Qin Shen.

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
Can I sit here?

317
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,360
Thank you.

318
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,440
You have time to come to the library?

319
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,080
I'm just free today.

320
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,560
Aren't you not busy at all?

321
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm kind of busy.

322
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,920
There're a lot stuff going on in the club.

323
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,720
They are tiresome,

324
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,000
but I have to do it.

325
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,920
It's driving me crazy.

326
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,200
But I'm about to be free of it.

327
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Finally.

328
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,280
You're busy with the club?

329
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,120
Of course.

330
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,200
Studying is my true love.

331
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,480
Everyone, listen up!

332
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,160
Here's a thing. A good one.

333
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,720
I guess you all know about

334
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,480
the promotional video.

335
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Every department should have an ambassador.

336
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,880
But,

337
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,400
we can have two ambassadors this time,

338
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,600
a girl and a boy.

339
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,200
I believe I am perfect for the role.

340
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,600
The boy must be handsome, right?

341
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,920
Right.

342
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
That would be me.

343
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,800
I am the most handsome one, isn't it? Chen Qinan.

344
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,480
Who?

345
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,040
If you are interested in it,

346
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
come sign up here.

347
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
Girls sign on the left, and boys on the right.

348
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,680
Me.

349
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,560
It's my show time.

350
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,800
Look at your size.

351
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,640
Why are there already

352
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,920
you and Chen Qinan?

353
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,000
Maybe we are handsome enough.

354
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,400
I think

355
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,880
Qin Shen will be one of the ambassadors.

356
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:26,200
Luo Xinxin

357
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,920
What do you think?
Luo Xinxin

358
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,360
Luo Xinxin

359
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,080
I think so, too.
Luo Xinxin

360
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,440
Luo Xinxin

361
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,200
About the girl?
Luo Xinxin

362
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,440
Yuan Qian
About the girl?
Luo Xinxin

363
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,680
Yi Ming
Chen Qinan
Yuan Qian
About the girl?
Luo Xinxin

364
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,632
Luo Xinxin
Yuan Qian
Chen Qinan
Yi Ming

365
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,600
Qin. You're not going to sign up?

366
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,880
I will skip you then.

367
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,320
Many have signed up.

368
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,760
I should sign up.

369
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
It's for the department after all.

370
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,280
What do you mean?

371
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
You want to compete with us?

372
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,200
Since when did you become such a show-off?

373
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,600
Bad boy.

374
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
One for Yuan Qian.

375
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
You can vote for someone who didn't sign up?

376
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,320
Someone vote for you on this.

377
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,960
But I didn't sign up..

378
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,280
No. No. No.

379
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,240
I signed you up for you.

380
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,480
Luo Xinxin.

381
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,680
Don't you afraid that

382
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
you will lose your sleep

383
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,320
for for doing that without my permission?

384
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,840
I just need accompany.

385
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
It's OK. You can think like this.

386
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,800
You probably won't be elected.

387
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,920
One for Luo Xinxin.

388
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,360
Wait.

389
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,880
The whiteboard

390
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,240
will be filled with names.

391
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,960
Can't we skip the one who only got one vote?

392
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,720
Objection!

393
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,200
Chen Qinan.

394
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,280
Why do you think I only have one vote?

395
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Apart from yourself,

396
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,160
who would vote for you?

397
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,400
I...

398
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,040
Stop!

399
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,320
How about we skip the one

400
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,440
who has less than one vote?

401
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,880
OK.

402
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,000
OK.

403
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,400
It's OK.

404
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,520
Alright.

405
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,480
The highest vote for boys goes to Qin Shen.

406
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,400
It's such a surprise

407
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,360
that Qin Shen signed up for it too!

408
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,360
Maybe some crappy friend

409
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,520
signed him up for him too.

410
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,080
Qin Shen can get the vote as long as he wants.

411
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,960
Only beautiful face matters in this crappy world.

412
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,800
I have one vote more than you.

413
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,000
Alright.

414
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,040
The highest vote for girls goes to Yuan Qian.

415
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,720
They are the couple representing us!

416
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,960
You are official

417
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,640
right now!

418
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,360
Stop! Stop!

419
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,840
Well. I got the wrong information.

420
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,400
The acting department got two places,

421
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,160
bu we only have one place.

422
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,880
So what do you think

423
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,600
if the girl or the boy should go?

424
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,800
I give up.

425
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Luo Xinxin signed me up for me but she didn't know

426
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
I have plans tomorrow.

427
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,880
Qin Shen is perfect for it

428
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,520
for his good grades and pretty face.

429
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,120
Let's congratulate him!

430
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,080
Congratulations, Qin Shen!

431
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
Yuan Qian.

432
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
You went shopping?

433
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,960
I bought news shoes

434
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,280
for the promotional video.

435
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,160
You're going to be in that video?

436
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,840
I remember Qin Shen will also be in it too.

437
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,960
Yeah.

438
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,400
So you gonna shoot some couple scenes?

439
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,000
Of course not.

440
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,280
We will shoot separately.

441
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,680
But

442
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,880
we could shoot some scenes together.

443
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,360
You are crushing it.

444
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,480
I love it to be crushed.

445
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,160
But it has to be soaked in the water.

446
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,640
Yeah.

447
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,680
It will taste better when it's crushed.

448
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,200
I have to go.

449
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,680
It's kind of late.

450
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,280
Bye.

451
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,600
Why aren't you in the rowing suit?

452
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,320
I can't train today.

453
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,880
I'm here to talk to the coach about it.

454
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,920
Why didn't you tell me?

455
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,760
So I didn't have to come in the morning.

456
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,200
You have to come any way,

457
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,640
so why should I call you?

458
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,760
After all,

459
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,960
I want to see you every day.

460
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,240
I was so uncomfortable yesterday

461
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,400
because I didn't see you.

462
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,040
Why do you have to see me?

463
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,680
You look upset today.

464
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,200
Because of you,

465
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,320
I missed the chance to be famous.

466
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,960
You can be my girlfriend.

467
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
The king's girl

468
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,800
will be known by all.

469
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,400
Let's go.

470
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,920
Where to?

471
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,400
I have a lot of things to do today.

472
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,760
As my assistant,

473
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,960
you should accompany me.

474
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,600
I have to finish the shoot today. Let's go.

475
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,520
Shoot?

476
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
For what?

477
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,840
I'm the ambassador of the sports department.

478
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,560
You know.

479
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,520
Such a coincidence.

480
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,480
Except for me,

481
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,120
everyone is busy with that video.

482
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,320
What?

483
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
I mean

484
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,280
will all of you

485
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,560
shoot together?

486
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,480
Yeah.

487
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
All of the ambassadors

488
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,120
will be together, I guess.

489
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,720
After all, we don't have that much money

490
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,640
to have too many cameras.

491
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,200
Am I going to meet Ling Wei

492
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,120
and Qin Shen?

493
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,800
I can't.

494
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,960
What happened?

495
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,600
I have a stomachache.

496
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,760
Shiyi.

497
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,880
You are so handsome,

498
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,840
so you can handle it.

499
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,040
It's killing me.

500
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,320
I have to go.

501
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,000
So close!

502
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,840
Weird.

503
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,720
Why am I afraid that Qin Shen would see us?

504
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,920
There's nothing between Song Siyi and I.

505
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,520
There's nothing to be afraid of.

506
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,480
I just fear that

507
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,120
I will lose my dignity

508
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,600
if he sees me being an assistant.

509
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,640
Are you going to shoot couple scenes?

510
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,240
Of course not.

511
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,480
We will shoot separately.

512
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,960
But,

513
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
we could shoot some scenes together.

514
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,040
Everyone, come on. Get ready.

515
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,320
We have to move the props.

516
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,200
Are you blind?

517
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,320
Can you afford to break it?

518
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,280
I'm sorry.

519
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,480
Yuan Qian. Hello.

520
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
I... I'm here to...

521
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:12,880
Come on.

522
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,760
Come help me.

523
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,120
I can't do the makeup alone.

524
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,240
Makeup?

525
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,240
I... I don't know how to do makeup.

526
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,720
It's a promotional video,

527
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,040
so you need someone who can do it well.

528
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,920
How can it be?

529
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,880
At least, you are better than boys.

530
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,200
Just the foundation, contouring

531
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,320
and the eyebrows will do.

532
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
It's easy.

533
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,160
Please.

534
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,640
We're getting behind the schedule,

535
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,000
and my hands hurt.

536
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,920
Alright.

537
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,280
Come here. She will do it for you.

538
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,040
Yuan Qian is so cute.

539
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,000
She is always drowsy

540
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,240
and she almost tripped.

541
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,200
I actually like her.

542
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,480
Every time I went out with her,

543
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,120
it's like I was with a kid.

544
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,960
She's so cute.

545
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,880
Done.

546
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,080
Thank you.

547
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,360
My assistant. Weren't you having a stomachache?

548
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,760
Why are you here?

549
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm here for the makeup.

550
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,280
Why are you here?

551
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,520
I'm here to fetch a thing.

552
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
And Ling Wei told me to help her.

553
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,680
You stomach is good now?

554
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,880
If it is,

555
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,160
do the makeup for me.

556
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,160
You just didn't want to work

557
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,680
so you said you have a stomachache, right?

558
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,720
I got better

559
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,280
while I was walking back.

560
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,880
Don't look at me.

561
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,880
Look upward.

562
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,280
What are you doing?

563
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,200
You don't want me to look at you,

564
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,840
so I gotta do something.

565
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,600
Move again,

566
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,280
I will break your arms.

567
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,040
Do you know how to do makeup?

568
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,320
Why do you keep doing the left side?

569
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,040
Why do you keep wiping the lift side?

570
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,280
Don't look for now.

571
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,440
Qin Shen,

572
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,680
If you keep frowning,

573
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,360
I will make you like Spock.

574
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Check it after I finish it.

575
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,280
I'm sure you'll be stunning.

576
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,280
As you wish.

577
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,680
Come on.

578
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,600
The ones with the makeup on come first.

579
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,640
We'll shoot in groups,

580
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,600
or we won't finish it.

581
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,280
Come on.

582
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,560
The sports guy. Come with me.

583
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,280
OK.

584
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,480
Let's go.

585
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
The photographer needs me.

586
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,400
I want to help her out here.

587
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,160
You are my girl, so you have to follow my words.

588
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,960
Come with me.

589
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,160
They look good together.

590
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,240
They seem to be having fun.

591
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,680
She started it after you, but she has finished.

592
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,240
If you can't do it, let her do it.

593
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,000
Just a minute.

594
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
Are you being upset

595
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,440
because Yuan Qian is close to another guy?

596
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,440
It's too hot today. You got water?

597
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,920
No.

598
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,120
Can you fan me?

599
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,080
Just hurry to finish your shoot.

600
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,920
I have to enjoy

601
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,000
the last minute when I still have an assistant.

602
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,480
That's enough.

603
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,680
Just say it. Do you accept the interview or not?

604
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,400
You were fine.

605
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,120
Why are you upset now?

606
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,960
Because of Qin Shen?

607
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,240
It's OK if you don't want to do it.

608
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,480
You don't have to treat me like a slave.

609
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,760
If I don't do this,

610
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,800
how can you spend your time

611
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,200
to be with me?

612
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,800
This is your last chance.

613
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,760
Don't try to rebel again.

614
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
Remember, I am the boss.

615
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,720
Besides,

616
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,480
you're a grown up now, and you can train alone.

617
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,920
If, as my boss,

618
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,240
you can stay by my side,

619
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,080
I want you to be my boss for my whole life.

620
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,720
You're giving me goosebumps!

621
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,000
Come on. Brother.

622
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,040
OK. Boss.

623
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,320
What's wrong?

624
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,440
It's fine.

625
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,800
I got a pulled muscle

626
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,720
when I practiced yesterday.

627
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,080
Why are you still here

628
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,240
and not take some rest.

629
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
I'm resting shooting the video,

630
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,120
or I may still be in the boat.

631
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,000
Such a hard worker.

632
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,040
Drink some water.

633
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,240
It's so hard to be an athlete.

634
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,200
I think it's harder

635
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,880
to win you over than to win the race.

636
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,080
Of course.

637
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm like an angle.

638
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
It's impossible for you mortals to win me over.

639
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,600
Just focus on your athletic career.

640
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,560
Look at them.

641
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,040
They're more like lovers than those of the acting department,

642
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,800
Yeah.

643
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,800
He's so cute.

644
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,960
Let's go.

645
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,240
What's wrong?

646
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,080
You. Move over there,

647
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,680
OK. Further back.

648
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,760
OK. Walk towards me.

649
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,320
OK. It's great.

650
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,840
Can I use it?

651
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
It's a shame that you're not in the video.

652
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,520
I'm kind of in it this way.

653
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,040
Yeah.

654
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,360
As my assistant.

655
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,920
Thank you.

656
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,000
If you are in the video,

657
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,000
what will our children react

658
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,720
when they see it?

659
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,160
What're you talking about?

660
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,320
Got you.

661
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm happy.

662
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,400
OK. Cut.

663
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,720
Alright. Alright.

664
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
Do some touch-up.

665
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,920
Let's shoot another one.

666
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,360
OK.

667
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,040
Where is it?

668
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,360
Look. It's here.

669
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,520
Hello.

670
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,880
Song Siyi?

671
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,200
Hold on, please.

672
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,760
OK. Thank you.

673
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,360
It's OK.

674
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,440
Key of the cabinet?

675
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,840
I remember you put it on top of the cabinet.

676
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,560
You may find it on top of the cabinet.

677
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,240
You find it?

678
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,760
OK. You can hang it up.

679
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,680
Thank you.

680
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,640
What's wrong with you?

681
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,240
How can I shoot with just one confetti cannon?

682
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,960
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,600
We're losing light.

684
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,280
There is no time.

685
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,160
Come on. Pick up the confetti.

686
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,000
What happened?

687
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,920
We were shooting a scene of the happy graduation.

688
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,400
Qin Shen bumped into me,

689
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,000
so the take was ruined.

690
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,240
There's only one cannon.

691
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,080
It'll need some time

692
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,400
to pick up all the confetti.

693
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,520
But there are a lot to shoot today.

694
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,320
I guess the time is running short.

695
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,480
It's you bumped into me!

696
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,320
Since there's no time,

697
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,200
I can help collecting it.

698
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,680
You want to make it up for him?

699
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,320
You should do it together.

700
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,000
One is not enough. Two of you will be perfect.

701
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,040
Come on, actors and actresses!

702
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,560
Come here. Come here.

703
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,360
OK.

704
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,320
Hurry up.

705
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,600
I have to go.

706
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,240
I'll be back.

707
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,760
Bye-bye.

708
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,160
Alright. Alright.

709
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,960
This is your move.

710
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,520
Come on.

711
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,120
Take it.

712
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,720
OK.

713
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,120
When I say "action",

714
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,440
walk over there.

715
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,760
And you can lower the camera, alright?

716
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,520
Everyone, focus on your lines.

717
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,320
Just for one scene, they shot it for several times.

718
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
I got dust all over my hands. It's not a wedding.

719
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,240
Why do they need confetti?

720
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,960
Yuan Qian.

721
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,280
Are you tired?

722
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,120
I'm fine.
