1
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,970
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,044
Episode 06

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
You haven't answered yet.

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,560
Qin Shen,

5
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,840
do you know what you're doing?

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,960
Ling Wei is going to be a dancer.

7
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,480
It has nothing to do with Qin Shen.

8
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,960
It was me.

9
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,920
Qin,

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,120
take her to the hospital.

11
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Don't leave her scarred.

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,480
Qin Shen, what are you waiting for?

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
You hurt her, it's your duty. Hurry up.

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,080
Sorry, I'll take you to the infirmary.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,160
Do you still feel dizzy?

16
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
It hurts?

17
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,920
Are you okay? How did you get hurt?

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,880
Why are you back so soon?

19
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,524
You finished the issues with Ling Wei?

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Is she all right?

21
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Many people are willing to help her.

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,040
I'm dispensable.

23
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,400
You sounds jealous?

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,400
Then you can leave first.

25
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,440
I'll be in charge of the key this week.

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,040
After checking the classroom, I'll lock the door.

27
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,600
Qin Shen,

28
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,947
why are you always being indifference to me?

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,635
If it wasn't for your ignorance,

30
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,080
do I need to please everyone around you?

31
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,880
I have no interest in

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,894
Jia Sicheng or Chen Qinan.

33
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,511
I didn't mean to take advantage of them as well.

34
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,840
I just

35
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,240
want to know more about you.

36
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
Why?

37
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,560
Why do you always presume me of the worst scenario?

38
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,080
In your view,

39
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,400
how evil am I?

40
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,880
Qin Shen.

41
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,600
Come out.

42
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,080
People studying sculpture are just not smart.

43
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
Always caught in the act.

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,360
I just arrived.

45
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,840
I didn't see anything.

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,280
And...

47
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,320
In TV dramas,

48
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
this is where the main character runs quickly after.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,669
Then you can go ahead.

50
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I don't love Ling Wei.

51
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,480
Me too.

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm gonna leave.

53
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
By the way,

54
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,600
well...

55
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,400
I shouldn't have ignored your explanation that day.

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Actually, I should have told you in advance.

58
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,440
Yeah, if you were occupied and forgot the date,

59
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,840
you should at least send me a text message.

60
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,200
I sent it.

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,320
How could I turned the notice off of my phone...

62
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,320
Right.

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,440
On the mute mode,

64
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
you won't get any notice.

65
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,720
Even if we call you by apps,

66
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
we won't get your answer.

67
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,360
It takes money to contact you.

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,080
I forgot when I turned it off.

69
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,800
What's wrong?

70
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,880
Got the headache again?

71
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,400
It's much better.

72
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,762
It's only been a few days of practice

73
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,920
and you're hurt.

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Do you think

75
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,880
it's necessary to continue practice?

76
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,120
I heard the shows

77
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,113
are more than the time allows.

78
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,560
At least a third of them will be canceled.

79
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,760
Who said that?

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
You're in charge of Arts. Don't you know that?

81
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,440
Students from the School of Literature said so.

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,760
The featureless ones will be cut first.

83
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,200
Like traditional songs and dances.

84
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,200
Just do as they wish.

85
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,000
It's good to spare us, the old and the sick.

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,840
How can that work?

87
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,680
With my leadership,

88
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
how could our show be canceled?

89
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,840
I need to be decent and honored!

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,400
God.

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,400
It's easy to make a boast.

92
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,160
But it's really hard to think of a new show.

93
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,680
Yuan Qian,

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,120
you have to help me this time anyway.

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,640
My judging teacher,

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,360
if you can remember it right,

97
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,720
it will come to you that

98
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,640
I was the one who came up with most of the ideas.

99
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
But you rejected all of them.

100
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Song Siyi,

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,640
what are you doing here?

102
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,240
What can I do in the library?

103
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,880
How could I know what you're doing here?

104
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,480
You majors in sports.

105
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,280
You're not here to study, right?

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
Comrade Yuan,

107
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
that's bias.

108
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,040
Sports Department also has cultural courses.

109
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,360
Of course we need to study.

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,520
By the way,

111
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,480
I want to find a girl to study together.

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,480
What are you doing?

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,040
I have a suggestion for you.

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,480
What?

115
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
My suggestion is that

116
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,720
you can find a boyfriend like me.

117
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,223
Are you worrying about the show for school celebration?

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,347
You wanna prepare a new one

119
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:48,353
but is afraid of being cut again?

120
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Am I right?

121
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,280
How do you know that?

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,920
Who am I?

123
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,760
I have spies.

124
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,640
So?

125
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,000
Get to the point.

126
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,040
Ancient Greek mythology

127
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
is the origin of ancient Greek art of sculpture.

128
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,252
You guys major in sculpture

129
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,720
can consider a combination of

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ancient Greek mythology and sculpture.

131
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,720
Go ahead.

132
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,840
Will I get any benefits?

133
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,280
I can't think of any good ideas

134
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,400
if there's no benefits.

135
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
No benefits. Say it or save it.

136
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,080
I think that

137
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,880
we can do a big science popularization

138
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,160
about ancient Greek mythologies and sculptures.

139
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Maybe in a talk show form.

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,800
Amusing but educational.

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,720
You call this a show?

142
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,240
It's a big hypnosis spot, okay?

143
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,720
Yuan Qian, what do you think?

144
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,400
Qin Shen.

145
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
I...

146
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm sorry, Qin.

147
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,280
I apologize to you on behalf her.

148
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,760
You... who do you think you are?

149
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,480
Who do you think you are?

150
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,840
May I sit here?

151
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,400
What's the matter?

152
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
The problem is...

153
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
our class need to prepare a show.

154
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I can't think of a better one in a short time.

155
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
So what about you performing a live instant sculpture?

156
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,880
But time is limited.

157
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,360
We have to find a skilled and fast one.

158
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,040
Chen Qinan highly recommended you.

159
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,600
He said you're a deft hand and was concentrated.

160
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,280
What?

161
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,200
Scan it, dork.

162
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
You want to send me something?

163
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,680
After what happened last time,

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
I found we didn't add each other friends.

165
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,720
Good.

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,520
We can discuss the show.

167
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,320
No one will watch that kind of show.

168
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
Give it up before it's too late.

169
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,720
How would you know if you haven't tried?

170
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,848
I've thought it well.

171
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,560
You can mould a principal there.

172
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I think that jock's suggestions

173
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,600
is not bad.

174
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,280
You mean the biggest hypnotic show

175
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,000
in sculpture history?

176
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
If it combines

177
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,600
Greek mythology and sculpture,

178
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,960
how's that?

179
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,880
Why didn't I think of that?

180
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,320
Pick one.

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,360
Pick one.

182
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Pick one.

183
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,640
Pick one for what?

184
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,840
For the place in the center.

185
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
The show is decided.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
Greek mythology and sculpture show.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
Pick one, be a good bro.

188
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Well done, monitor.

189
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,960
You think of that?

190
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,040
If I can't even do that,

191
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,680
how can I be the monitor?

192
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,880
Let me remind you again.

193
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,840
You can be the monitor

194
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,480
because you were the only one in the class

195
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,960
who compete.

196
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,280
It has nothing to do with your capability.

197
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,240
Thank you.

198
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,600
Can you stop embarrassing me?

199
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,880
Listen,

200
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,720
although Yuan Qian put forward the idea,

201
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm the one who has the last word.

202
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
So I still have some capability.

203
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Shameless.

204
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,440
Monitor,

205
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,520
this is the central or the general...?

206
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,000
Of course it's general.

207
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,000
If you stand in the center,

208
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
the show will be ruined.

209
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,320
Well...

210
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
Why... Why I can't stand in the center?

211
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,920
Am I not handsome?

212
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,120
Qin,

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,600
pick one.

214
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,880
See?

215
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,160
This is the fate. No one can fight against it.

216
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
Don't tell me this is the central place.

217
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
Yes.

218
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,880
Get lost.

219
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,080
Poseidon.

220
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,120
God of the sea?

221
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,240
This is good.

222
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,840
There are only us left.

223
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,840
Come on, fight to the death.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,040
I will have the Zeus. It's settled.

225
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,200
Are you dreaming?

226
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,360
I'm Qin Shen's father.

227
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm Apollo's father.

229
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,440
Don't force me to do it.

230
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
Look at the differences between us.

231
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,920
You could easily get hurt.

232
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,240
What do do then?

233
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,680
Apollo seemed to have only one father.

234
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,840
You can take this one.

235
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
No girls have gotten it yet.

236
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,000
Leto?

237
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,840
You want me to act a girl?

238
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,520
At least she is Apollo's mother, okay?

239
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
If you don't want it, someone will want it.

240
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,160
Wait.

241
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,840
Her rank is higher though.

242
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,720
I will take it.

243
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,360
Listen. You can only be Leto

244
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
for the show.

245
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,760
Zeus wouldn't marry you

246
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,160
is he's not blind.

247
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,680
Besides,

248
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,560
you have a handsome son: Apollo.

249
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,040
Alright.

250
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,920
You've all got your part, right?

251
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,320
Please go back and do some research.

252
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,680
Make sure you know about your character.

253
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,280
We have special props this time,

254
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
so let's work in groups.

255
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,240
Be sure to get fully ready for the show.

256
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,840
Okay?

257
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,400
Okay.

258
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,960
Okay.

259
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,640
Okay.

260
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,480
Okay, honey. Give me a kiss.

261
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,440
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

262
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,200
Get away.

263
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Give me a kiss.

264
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm impressed. You do your makeup everyday.

265
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
We're going to buy supplies and do the dirty work.

266
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,680
Do you need makeup for that?

267
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,920
What do you know?

268
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,440
That means I respect all the strangers who'll see me.

269
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
What take you so long?

270
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,000
Didn't we have an appointment at 8:30?

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
Now it's 9.

272
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,040
Aren't all of us should be from our class?

273
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,520
Why there is a foreigner?

274
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,480
Good morning.

275
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Why are you here?

276
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,040
I'm here on purpose.

277
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
How did you know we are here?

278
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,440
I have an informant.

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,480
You should leave. That's our class activity.

280
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,360
You shouldn't be here.

281
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
You're kicking down the ladder?

282
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,080
If I hadn't reminded you of Greek mythology,

283
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,440
would you think of this show?

284
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,400
Besides,

285
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,000
although I'm not in your department,

286
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,720
I can be useful.

287
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,720
What can you do?

288
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Move things.

289
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,520
We have our own, OK?

290
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Qin is better.

291
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,880
Qin, right?

292
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,360
We should go.

293
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,520
Let's go.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,040
Let's go, too.

295
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
It's loose?

296
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,720
Try it yourself.

297
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,720
Need my help?

299
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,960
Can you lift it, weak?

300
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,840
I can.

301
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
Qin,

302
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,000
why are you here alone?

303
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Weren't you with Yuan Qian and Song Siyi?

304
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,880
Where are they?

305
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,320
They went to buy wigs.

306
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Why didn't you go with them?

307
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,560
I need to buy some fabric.

308
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,280
I'm speechless. You are too naive.

309
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,000
You should follow them.

310
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Why?

311
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
Shouldn't you try to keep the goodies

312
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
within the family of our department?

313
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,440
Don't you know?

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,200
Look at him,

315
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,880
he is barely a piece of scrap metal.

316
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He is not comparable to the diamond.

317
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,120
Yuan Qian is a goody,

318
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,640
but I guess we have to give her away.

319
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,480
Take your dirty hands away.

320
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
I'll be off.

321
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

322
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,280
Rock, paper, scissors.

323
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,880
I won.

324
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,640
I'll get us some drinks.

325
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,440
You can have a rest here.

326
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,360
What would you like to drink?

327
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080
There's a shop selling the pear juice.

328
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,200
Wait for me.

329
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,560
Are you done?

330
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
Why do you carry them back alone?

331
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,720
Not only jocks have biceps.

332
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,720
The others will be back soon.

333
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,320
Which role will you play?

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,040
What?

335
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,880
Artemis.

336
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,400
My elder sister?

337
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
I am

338
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,160
in the script.

339
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,960
In Greek mythology,

340
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,640
the free Artemis is the godess of hunt,

341
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,200
wild animals,

342
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,080
and wilderness.

343
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,560
She loves wilderness.

344
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,160
She is against marriage.

345
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,560
And she protects virgins who refuses to get married.

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,560
I should buy you a ceryneian hind .

347
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,960
Right.

348
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,240
It doesn't have to be that flashy.

349
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,200
There is something in common

350
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,160
between you and Artemis.

351
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,120
Is there?

352
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,840
You're both woman.

353
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,760
Thank you.

354
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,520
That's not funny.

355
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,880
It's not me.

356
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,200
You brought the chocolate?

357
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,960
Chen Qinan gave them me.

358
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
I didn't expect Chen Qinan is actually thoughtful.

359
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,840
I have to take this.

360
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,080
It should be the delivery guy.

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,240
I can pick it up when we're back at school.

362
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,240
Have you received all the books?

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Yes.

364
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,440
But I've been busy transferring my major.

365
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,120
I don't think I have time the time to read.

366
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,720
Besides, the question bank

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,960
may change after a few years.

368
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,520
Oil painting and sculpture are alike.

369
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,480
They're all art.

370
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,800
You can be a teacher for wither of them.

371
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,600
Just prepare for the teacher certification exam.

372
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,400
Why are they alike?

373
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,560
There are differences

374
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,600
between the major I like

375
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,960
and the alternative.

376
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,960
Everything is for you being employed.

377
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,680
It doesn't matter you like it or not.

378
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,840
You are too young

379
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,800
to have the view.

380
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,560
From now on,

381
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,160
focus on getting employed after graduation,

382
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,640
so that you won't be worry about it

383
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,800
and getting frustrated.

384
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,360
There's a long time before graduation.

385
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,640
Yuan Qian,

386
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,960
I'm your father.

387
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,240
I'm doing this for your own good.

388
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,520
For me?

389
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,080
If you do,

390
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
you should respect my choice.

391
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,760
I've always respected your choice.

392
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,320
I let you learn what you wanted.

393
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,640
But you have to listen to me on this.

394
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,840
Things you learn in school

395
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,320
are useless.

396
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,000
You have to start from scratch when you get the job.

397
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,000
Qin Shen.

398
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
You got a package too?

399
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,480
What...?

400
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,000
Yuan Qian is over there.

401
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,320
Yuan Qian.

402
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,760
Yuan Qian.

403
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,680
What's wrong with you?

404
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,520
Why are you crying? What happened?

405
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,280
Don't cry. Don't cry.

406
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,520
Tell me about it.

407
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,120
It's too heavy for me to carry.

408
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,760
That's why you're crying?

409
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,000
Really?

410
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,600
I have my period today,

411
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
so I'm a little emotional.

412
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,120
Alright.

413
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,040
Come on. Let's go.

414
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Stand up.

415
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,440
I'll help you carry it. You take the small one.

416
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
It's so heavy.

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,760
By the way,

418
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
Qin Shen is so weird.

419
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,440
- I just saw him... - Did you meet Qin Shen?

420
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Yes.

421
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
It's his tissue.

422
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,840
He is tall and strong.

423
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,960
But why didn't he

424
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,880
come help you see you crying?

425
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,880
I don't get him.

426
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,920
What're you thinking?

427
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Nothing.

428
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,040
Qin Shen.

429
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,400
Are you leaving early for the rehearsal?

430
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,400
I'm also going there. Together?

431
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,760
Thank you for not coming for me that day.

432
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,600
That would be embarrassing.

433
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,680
Which day?

434
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,360
Thank you for being such a gentleman.

435
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,960
I can see that

436
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,440
we are the same kind.

437
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm not like you.

438
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,840
I'm not as picky as you are.

439
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,000
It does seem that we are different now.

440
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,160
Right?

441
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
You're not good enough.

442
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,200
We are different in this.

443
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,440
I take my words back.

444
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,200
You don't know what being a gentleman is.

445
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,040
The place for rehearsal is on the left.

446
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,440
I want to go this way.

447
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,360
Stay true to myself.

448
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,480
Bye.

449
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,360
Hurry up. Paint your mother well.

450
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,400
Meeting?

451
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Qin,

452
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,160
don't forget to paint the chest.

453
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,760
I'm white all over. How can I have a meeting?

454
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,680
Lu Jianing, stop speaking the phone.

455
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,520
Hurry to do the makeup.

456
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,840
OK. OK.

457
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,360
Okay, I'm gonna hang up now. Bye.

458
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,080
Yuan Qian.

459
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,280
Listen to me for a second.

460
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,720
I have finished your costume.

461
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,080
But now there is a problem.

462
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,160
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?

463
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,960
Among all the fabrics,

464
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,200
only those in this bag

465
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,520
has the poor quality.

466
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,160
Take a look.

467
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,040
What's wrong?

468
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,440
The fabric is bad.

469
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,320
I bought it and I didn't pay much attention.

471
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,120
Can we make it if we ask for a exchange now?

472
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,920
It's been a week.

473
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
I'll be surprised we'll be allowed to exchange them.

474
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,760
That's unfortunate.

475
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,880
That's fine.

476
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,520
Use it to make my costume.

477
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,960
I will be careful.

478
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,680
What? You will stand in the center.

479
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,800
It's OK.

480
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,960
I don't have to move a lot.

481
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,240
I'll be off then.

482
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
What is this white stuff on your hair?

483
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,400
Maybe I got it

484
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,120
when I painted Lu Jianing.

485
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,760
There is a thing I want to tell you.

486
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,160
You need to wash your hair.

487
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,800
Bye.

488
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,800
It's coming. It's coming,

489
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,200
The winner of

490
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,840
the rehearsal contest is

491
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
the sculpture department.

492
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,880
Ancient Greek Mythology Sculpture Show.

493
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,760
I knew it.

494
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,600
With such a good theme,

495
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,080
it's impossible we can't win it!

496
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,760
We win because of my handsomeness.

497
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,800
Look.

498
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,840
Qin didn't show up, but we still won the place.

499
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,800
What does that mean?

500
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,760
What?

501
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,480
That means I'm more handsome than Qin.

502
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,600
That means you're getting more shameless.

503
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,320
But we have to spread the news

504
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
that we won it.

505
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,840
Yes.

506
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,520
I remember, the one in our class, the...

507
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,440
The one in the reporter club...

508
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
You mean Yuan Qian?

509
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,440
Right. Right.

510
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,560
- Only she is in the reporter club. - Right.

511
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,200
Find her.

512
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,240
What if

513
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,200
we send Qin

514
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,880
seduce her with his face.

515
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,680
Just joking.

516
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,000
But I think it's possible.

517
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
Qin, why don't you...

518
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,120
Get lost.

519
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,880
Let's think about other ways.

520
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
Other ways.

521
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,760
We'll make it work.

522
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,000
See?

523
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
I told you.

524
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,760
We don't need to be here early.

525
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,920
In case of emergency,

526
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,640
we have more time for preparation now.

527
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,320
I'll get you some drinks. What do you want?

528
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,360
Water.

529
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,920
Water.

530
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay.

531
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,080
Hello, Yuan Qian.

532
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,640
He... Hello.

533
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm here for Qin Shen.

534
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,040
He's not here yet. Why don't you wait for a while?

535
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,280
Okay.

536
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I'll wait at the door. Thank you.

537
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,280
There will be no dance. Why is she here?

538
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,480
She must come here for some guy.

539
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,440
It's not my business if she comes.

540
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,880
It must because of the spring.

541
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,280
Enough. Enough.

542
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,440
That's all for today.

543
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,840
Dismissed.

544
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
Thank you.

545
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,400
Thank you. Thank you.

546
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,920
Let's go.

547
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,760
See you tomorrow.

548
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,080
Yuan Qian, what are you doing?

549
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,480
Pack up and let's go.

550
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm just tired.

551
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,320
You've been acting weird this afternoon.

552
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,080
You seemed distracted.

553
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Let's go.

554
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,720
Qin Shen,

555
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,160
you eat these?

556
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,440
There are too many of them.

557
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,640
It's bought by someone else.

558
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,400
Ling Wei came again.

559
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,080
These are not mine.

560
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,360
What?

561
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,160
These are Chen Qinan's.

562
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,920
I just take them for him.

563
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,520
Yuan Qian,

564
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,640
did you see what just happened?

565
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,600
What?

566
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,440
Was he explaining to me?

567
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Was he afraid that I would misunderstand him and Ling Wei?

568
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,800
My god.

569
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,240
I knew it.

570
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,720
Such a treasure like me

571
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,680
will be discovered one day.

572
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,280
I think you are mad.

573
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,680
It's either me or you he was explaining to.

574
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,960
To be honest,

575
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,920
I've already felt the chemistry

576
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,320
between you guys.

577
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,800
Stop kidding me.

578
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,600
Why do you deny it and hit me?

579
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,960
Remember.

580
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,560
When the third group goes up, the fog effect

581
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,280
will block the view.

582
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,800
Boys. You go first.

583
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,880
Where's Yuan Qian?

584
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,920
Why she's not here?

585
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,200
I don't know.

586
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,880
She left dorm early.

587
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,440
My god.

588
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Xuexue,

589
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I think you have the body

590
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,160
perfect for Athena.

591
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,360
I thought I was more like Hera.

592
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,560
I find it now that

593
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,960
you are the wife of Zeus.

594
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,320
When you and Chen Qinan are on the stage.

595
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,960
I believe that will be the climax of our show.

596
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
What're you saying?

597
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,880
Where is Yuan Qian? Where is Liu Chengren?

598
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,360
Why haven't they arrived yet?

599
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,680
Your look makes me desperate.

600
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,320
I take back what I just said.

601
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,560
It's not a fight between the wife and the mistress.

602
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,080
It's the fight between us and the monster.

603
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,320
Who are you talking about?

604
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Can you still laugh?

605
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,360
There is only 1 hour left and they are not here.

606
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,840
All of you, try to contact Yuan Qian now!

607
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,480
How can they drop the ball on this?

608
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,360
Right.

609
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,040
Hurry up.

610
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,800
Yuan Qian. Yuan Qian.

611
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,960
Call fatty now

612
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,960
I'm here. I'm here.

613
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,160
Liu Chengren, you fatty.

614
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,080
Where the hell were you?

615
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,600
There's only half an hour left.

616
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,760
Don't you know you're big

617
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
and need long time to be painted?

618
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,720
How can you be late?

619
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,880
Application form for transference.?

620
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,440
Liu Chengren.

621
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,200
You want to transfer to another major?

622
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,880
My god.

623
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,040
No wonder you were not quite enthusiastic about our stuff.

624
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,800
So you wanted to transfer to another major?

625
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,000
I...

626
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,200
I was reassigned to learn sculpture.

627
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,480
Well done, fatty.

628
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,200
You've been longing to run away from us?

629
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,760
Okay, enough.

630
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,480
Every man has his own choice.

631
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,600
Yuan Qian.

632
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,920
What's wrong with you?

633
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,600
You want to transfer to another major too?

634
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,520
You're so late.

635
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,880
Don't you think for the group?

636
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,680
I'll put your bags alongside the others'.

637
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,840
Such a poor taste.

638
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,040
Your bag looks like a man's bag.

639
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,960
Come here. Let me paint you.

640
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,520
What's wrong?

641
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,880
Yuan Qian.

642
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
Why are you here? Get the makeup done.

643
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,000
I want to go to the toilet.

644
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,000
You...

645
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,640
I shouldn't have filled out all the form

646
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,640
and sent it to the teacher.

647
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,280
If they're found out,

648
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,040
I won't have the chance to lie.

649
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,120
Lucky that she didn't put my bag somewhere else.

650
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,560
I found it.

651
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,160
Why haven't you started your makeup?

652
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,960
On my way.

653
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,520
My daughter, here you are.

654
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,560
Am I beautiful?

655
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,800
Like a fairy.

656
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,520
What?

657
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,400
Xuexue,

658
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
take a look at my accessories.

659
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,160
How's that? Are you done with your waistline?

660
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,160
Yuan Qian.

661
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Here, quiver.

662
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,480
There'll be

663
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,440
a ceryneian hind because it looks good on the stage.

664
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,640
But it's just an ornament,

665
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,640
you can't actually use it.

666
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,400
Just like in the rehearsal,

667
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,000
stand in the fixed zone

668
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,240
and act in the zone.

669
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,200
Some one will pull you out.

670
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,240
Why do you pressing on your chest?

671
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,800
Isn't that a little low?

672
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,760
We're all dressed like this.

673
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's Greek style.

674
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,320
Elegant and sexy.

675
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,920
Okay.

676
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,840
You're white all over. Nothing will show.

677
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,160
I'll be off then.

678
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,880
By the way,

679
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,360
your role is important.

680
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,800
Don't make any mistake.

681
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,800
You can do it.

682
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,560
Bye.

683
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,440
Okay.

684
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,560
Don't want it?

685
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,920
Thank you.

686
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,640
When do we play?

687
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,880
Wait for the notice.

688
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,120
Some of the shoe has been played over time.

689
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,600
Why do you smile?

690
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,560
It's a little strange

691
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,080
to look at our look off the stage.

692
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,320
Your look is awesome.

693
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,200
But your look is not exactly as what I thought.

694
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,640
Why?

695
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,160
I remember several sculptures of Apollo

696
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,360
are undressed.

697
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,840
That... That's not what I meant.

698
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Stop talking.

699
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,520
I still need the dress

700
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,400
or I'll be caught.

701
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,760
There're so many audiences.

702
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,280
I suddenly feel a little nervous.

703
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,200
Yuan Qian, is my Medusa look.

704
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,680
awesome?

705
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,280
It looks a little gross.

706
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,120
Hurry. Hurry.

707
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
We need to get ready.

708
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,360
Come with me to the waiting area.

709
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,600
Go! Go! Go!

710
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,880
This piece of crap

711
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,040
is the host?

712
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,560
Brother,

713
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,280
I suddenly find that

714
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,880
the dress looks good on you.

715
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,040
Don't touch me off the stage, OK?

716
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,960
Why did you push me?

717
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm getting angry.

718
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,680
Look at yourself.

719
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,480
You haven't

720
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,880
been beaten up because I follow the motto of the university.

721
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,680
I...

722
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,880
You're two of a kind.

723
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,000
How can you talk to your dad like that?

724
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,720
Mom is not happy too.

725
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,280
Stay away from me

726
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,640
when taking photos.

727
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,160
I don't want to be in the same photo with you.

728
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
Impossible.

729
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,440
No one can separate the three of us.

730
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,600
Right.

731
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,360
Thanks for the show

732
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,200
presented by the dance department.

733
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,160
Meanwhile.

734
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,520
sculpture department

735
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,200
also has a show for us.

736
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,320
I heard their show won the first place in rehearsal competition.

737
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,280
Please enjoy

738
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,680
the Ancient Greek Mythology Show.

739
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,520
Thanks for the excellent the performance

740
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,640
from the sculpture department.

741
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,480
Now, let's welcome the students from the dance department.

742
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,720
What are you doing here?

743
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,760
I sneaked in.

744
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Why?

745
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,840
No seats in the front row.

746
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,520
No one can stand in the auditorium,

747
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,440
except for photographers.

748
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,680
There has a good view.

749
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,840
You

750
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,680
are here for Yuan Qian?

751
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,880
That's a secret.

752
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,320
Qin Shen.

753
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
Don't be afraid.

754
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,560
Good!

755
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,840
Good!

756
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,280
Good!

757
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,280
Look at me.
