1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,760
What's the relationship between you and Song Siyi?

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,280
It's none of your business.

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,080
Why did you let him hug you?

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
You let Ling Wei

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,600
hug you too!

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,760
Don't come here.

9
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Come on.

10
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,720
Yuan Qian!

11
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,800
Why did you just disappear?

12
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
I was looking for you.

13
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,680
Are you okay?

14
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,040
I'm fine. Really.

15
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,680
It's you?

16
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,520
Why are you together?

17
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,960
You can go. I want to talk to him.

18
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
It's getting late.

19
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,200
It's not a good idea for you to talk to a boy alone.

20
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,280
It is none of your business.

21
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
Let her go.

22
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,440
It'll be dangerous

23
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,560
to talk to him alone.

24
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,840
You'll be safe with me.

25
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
What are you doing?

26
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
What's your problem?

27
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,320
Hands off!

28
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,640
Good.

29
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,280
You want a fight?

30
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,800
I have no problem with that.

31
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,840
It's the first time I think

32
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
you actually have a good idea.

33
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,840
Calm down, Song Siyi.

34
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,240
Didn't you see that?

35
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,760
It's him who wanted to punch me.

36
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
I was just trying to protect myself.

37
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,200
But you pulled him first.

38
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,240
Don't you know

39
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
why I pulled him?

40
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,400
Song Siyi.

41
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,760
Enough.

42
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,120
You.

43
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,440
Let me walk you to your dorm.

44
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm good.

45
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,640
I can walk her back.

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,080
Yuan Qian.

47
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,160
What do you think?

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,640
It's a wide road,

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,000
and why don't we go together?

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,280
Here we are.

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,080
You can go.

52
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,280
I'll watch you go upstairs.

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,800
Me too.

54
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Okay. I gotta go.

55
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,360
Go back on your own.

56
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,600
Don't mess with each other.

57
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,920
Go.

58
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,040
Hold on.

59
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,800
What's your order?

60
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,720
Your birthday is coming soon.

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,040
If you want any present,

62
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,840
let me know.

63
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,840
I will buy it for you.

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,200
Okay. I see.

65
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,200
I gotta go.

66
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,080
I just wanted to

67
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,960
use that declaration to protect Yuan Qian.

68
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,480
I don't want to see her hurt

69
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
because of all the gossips.

70
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,120
But it doesn't mean

71
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
I only want to be her friend.

72
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
I won't give up on her.

73
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,680
You think you are winning

74
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,720
because Yuan Qian protected you?

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
You think I'm winning too?

76
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,160
I don't care what you think.

77
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
She will be with me

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,920
on her birthday.

79
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,320
You don't even know her birthday, right?

80
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,520
We've been friends since childhood.

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,360
We spent every birthday together,

82
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
and we were happy.

83
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
Light off. Good night.

84
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,520
Good night.

85
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,240
It's crazy.

86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,000
How can I fall asleep?

87
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,960
Song Siyi, calm down.

88
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,960
I don't care what you think.

89
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,080
She will be with me

90
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
on her birthday.

91
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
You don't even know her birthday, right?

92
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,400
Bro, you spill it!

93
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,320
Are yo too concentrated on thinking about Yuan Qian?

94
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,320
If I didn't see it,

95
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,000
our room will be inundated.

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,040
A man in love is scary.

97
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,920
My god.

98
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,560
No, you're not scary.

99
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,400
Yi Ming, where is the registration form?

100
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,920
It's in my bag. You have filled it out.

101
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
I want to check my ID number.

102
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,480
You wouldn't make any mistake.

103
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,640
Give it to me.

104
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,240
Let me find it.

105
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,320
It shouldn't be wrong.

106
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:39,216
Yuan Qian

107
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:50,896
17th, May

108
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,040
Where are you?

109
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,280
In the classroom. What's the matter?

110
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,280
You want to come see me training.

111
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,600
It's too hot. I don't wanna go.

112
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,640
Xue Congyang is coming too.

113
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,960
You can come with her.

114
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
You asked her again?

115
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you know that she...?

116
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,800
What's wrong?

117
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,840
If you are always so kind to everyone,

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,280
others may get the wrong idea.

119
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
Xue Congyang won't hurt Yuan Qian.

120
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,320
She joined your fan club

121
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
for herself.

122
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,520
Are you go training?

123
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,920
Or go having meeting?

124
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,120
Neither.

125
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,760
You asked me out

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,240
to have a meal together?

127
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,480
I want to talk to you about a thing.

128
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,920
What's that?

129
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I want to know

130
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,760
do you join the fun club

131
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,280
because you like me?

132
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,000
I...

133
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,680
By "like", I mean it in a romantic way.

134
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,360
Xue Congyang,

135
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,840
I am so sorry.

136
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
What?

137
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,520
I'm sorry

138
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,760
if you got the wrong idea

139
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
because of something I did.

140
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,360
I always came to you

141
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
because I like Yuan Qian.

142
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,640
I wanted to know where she went

143
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,280
and you always answered my question,

144
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
so it became a habit that I came to you.

145
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,240
I am sorry.

146
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,400
I won't be like that again.

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,120
I hope

148
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,920
you can let it go.

149
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,240
Xuexue.

150
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,760
Xue...

151
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Why are you crying?

152
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,120
Was he being mean to you?

153
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,840
What did he do? I will punch him for you.

154
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,680
I... I am fine.

155
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,760
Song Siyi, what did you do?

156
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,800
And why did she cry?

157
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
I thought she liked me.

158
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
So?

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
So I made everything clear with her.

160
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,880
You!

161
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,280
Do I need to tell you

162
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,560
how to take care of a girl?

163
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,760
What's wrong?

164
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,960
Xuexue,

165
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,440
are you okay?

166
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,040
Xuexue.

167
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,800
Xuexue.

168
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,840
Don't be sad.

169
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,600
He just knows no limits and be kind to everyone.

170
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,040
He doesn't worth your love.

171
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,360
Actually, I knew from his acceptance speech

172
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,280
that

173
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,880
he likes you.

174
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,720
So what. I don't like him.

175
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,280
You don't like him?

176
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,320
I promise.

177
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,080
I have no feelings for him.

178
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,720
And I actually like someone else.

179
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,200
Really?

180
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,880
Who is he?

181
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,120
I will let you know

182
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,160
when I get it done.

183
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,360
Is it Qin...?

184
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,040
Shut up.

185
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,400
Okay. We will wait for your good news.

186
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,040
Don't cry, Xuexue.

187
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't worry.

188
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,840
We won't like the same guy.

189
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,760
I didn't mean that.

190
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Alright. Stop crying.

191
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,400
He is not the only guy in the world.

192
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
You can move your target.

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,480
All right.

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
As long as we're united as one.

195
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,680
Right.

196
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Your birthday is coming, Yuan Qian.

197
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,280
Should I let it slip

198
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,080
and let you know

199
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
the presents I want?

200
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,480
And then you can chip in to buy me a present.

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,280
You wish.

202
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,360
You'll have to pay

203
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,600
for the dinner on your birthday.

204
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,640
But you can have a birthday present.

205
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,800
Really?

206
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,680
But it must be under 5 yuan.

207
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
You know me.

208
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
I hate those devoted to mammon and materialism.

209
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,720
Get lost.

210
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,800
Fortunately, you have a generous mind.

211
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
I thought you would have a breakdown

212
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,440
because of those rumors.

213
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
No way.

214
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,520
Or I would fall into the trap.

215
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,440
I wonder which bitch did that.

216
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,400
There is only one question.

217
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,800
Do you know Dai Yaqing posted it?

218
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,520
So you know.

219
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,200
I...

220
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,080
All these time, you've been staying close to me

221
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
saying we're friends,

222
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,440
but how could you keep it a secret

223
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,040
since you knew Dai Yaqing posted it?

224
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you sure

225
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,960
we are friends?

226
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,080
I do think we're friends.

227
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
It's just hard for me

228
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,680
to choose side between you and her.

229
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,920
I couldn't say anything or do anything.

230
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,480
You couldn't do anything?

231
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,320
That means you've made your choice.

232
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,520
I am sorry.

233
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
That bitch will be exposed.

234
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,800
Right.

235
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Ling Wei,

236
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,680
I saw Song Siyi downstairs.

237
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,800
Really?

238
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Why was he here?

239
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,040
He was talking to Xue Congyang.

240
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,640
I don't know what were they talking,

241
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,640
but Xue Congyang was so sad and crying.

242
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,880
Why did they go for Xue Congyang?

243
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,040
What's the look?

244
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,800
Xue Congyang was also involved

245
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,400
in that thing about Yuan Qian?

246
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,560
Actually,

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,840
the account I used to post it

248
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,960
was created by Xue Congyang.

249
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,640
We managed the account together.

250
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,560
That is bad.

251
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,880
What do you mean?

252
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,840
Did they know something?

253
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,920
Will they sue me?

254
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,600
Wei,

255
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,240
you cannot leave me alone.

256
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,960
You've been speaking for her,

257
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,400
so I didn't tell you.

258
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,480
You thought I wouldn't know it

259
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,560
as long as you didn't tell me?

260
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,640
There're many posts

261
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
about the our life in the Dance Department.

262
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,240
What should I do?

263
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,880
Don't worry.

264
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,920
I will help you

265
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,400
no matter what happens.

266
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
Thank you for forgiving me.

267
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,520
Of course I will forgive you.

268
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,360
But that's not enough.

269
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,440
You need Yuan Qian to forgive you.

270
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,680
I'll go with you and apologize to her.

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,400
Let's make it up, OK?

272
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,840
Morning!

273
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, are you waiting for me?

274
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,360
Nope.

275
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,840
I'm going to the cafeteria.

276
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,840
I'll go with you.

277
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,400
What are you doing?

278
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Don't get in others' way.

279
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,400
There is only one beef noodle.

280
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,680
I will buy something else.

281
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,440
I don't want to...

282
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,080
Excuse me.

283
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,320
Two cups of soy milk and a bowl of wonton, please.

284
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,800
Why don't you eat?

285
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,720
Wait for me.

286
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,280
It's for me?

287
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,560
You like it, right?

288
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Yep.

289
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,040
I like it.

290
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
I had milk and and apple before I came.

291
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,480
My plan was just a corn.

292
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,160
How can I finish these noodles?

293
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,960
What's your plan for your birthday?

294
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,080
I'll celebrate it with my roommates.

295
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
This is my first birthday in the university.

296
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,960
Right.

297
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,800
Have you celebrated your first birthday here?

298
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,680
Yep.

299
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,040
You were with me that day.

300
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,840
I was there?

301
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
How come I can't remember any of it?

302
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
It's the day you fell into the lake

303
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,400
and ruined my sculpture.

304
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,520
Such a memorable birthday.

305
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,280
You don't have to stressed.

306
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,120
I will not revenge on you

307
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,480
by ruining your birthday.

308
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm not that evil.

309
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,600
I still look forward to my birthday.

310
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,080
We bought a cake with fairies

311
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,840
for Luo Xinxin on her birthday.

312
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,480
I hope they can also buy me one.

313
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,080
If they don't,

314
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,160
you can come to me.

315
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,360
Am I mad? Why should I let you buy me the cake?

316
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,880
Who are you to me?

317
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,720
Why should you buy it?

318
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,400
I mean

319
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,120
if they don't buy you one,

320
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
you can come to me,

321
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,520
and I will remind them to buy you one.

322
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,840
Yuan Qian, what's wrong?

323
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,960
Are you feeling unwell?

324
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,640
Don't touch me.

325
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,960
Or I will vomit.

326
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,040
What's wrong?

327
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,360
Nothing.

328
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,040
Why do you look like a shit?

329
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,920
I ate too much.

330
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,520
Careful.

331
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,040
I feel sick.

332
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,600
You are making me want to throw up too.

333
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm a living proof that people only fall in love

334
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,600
when they overeat and got nothing else to do.

335
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,320
You should

336
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,920
fill the temples.

337
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,760
Come on.

338
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,880
Just say what you want to know.

339
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,440
Don't beat around the bush.

340
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,000
You want to know

341
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,800
why Yuan Qian is not here?

342
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,840
Yuan Qian

343
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,720
had an apple and a bottle of milk in the dorm,

344
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,440
then she had a big bowl of beef noodles

345
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,960
and a bottle of soy milk in the cafeteria.

346
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,000
So she is feeling awful now.

347
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,280
I guess that's because she ate too much

348
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
and she is flatulent.

349
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,600
No even a "thank you"

350
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,440
for my information.

351
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,360
He is just like Yuan Qian,

352
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,000
good at kicking down the ladder.

353
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,640
Be brave. It will be fine.

354
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,200
It is not a good time

355
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,880
to fight with her.

356
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,360
Yuan Qian.

357
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,720
Yuan Qian.

358
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,680
I am sorry.

359
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm here to apologize to you.

360
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,680
I shouldn't have spoken ill of you on the internet.

361
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,120
I am sorry.

362
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,400
And

363
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,240
I have deleted my post,

364
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,360
and I made the deceleration.

365
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
I'm sorry.

366
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,680
I have some emergency.

367
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,240
I got to go. Let's talk about it later.

368
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
Yuan Qian,

369
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm sincere with my apology.

370
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
Do you have to be so condescending?

371
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,080
Yaqing. We are here to apologize.

372
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,360
You can talk later.

373
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,880
Let's go.

374
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,120
Where to go?

375
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,040
I wanna go to drugstore.

376
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,680
To the infirmary.

377
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,680
Take the pills.

378
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,560
3 times a day and 1 pill a time.

379
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,240
If you still feel terrible,

380
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,640
we can try other ways.

381
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,160
Will I have the gastroscope ?

382
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,520
I heard it's extremely terrible.

383
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,000
Take the pills first.

384
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,320
My stomach was swelling for the day.

385
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,160
Why don't you come to the hospital then?

386
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,960
I thought it's nothing.

387
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,560
No illness is nothing.

388
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,280
They all deserve your attention.

389
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,760
Okay.

390
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,080
It's like a magic.

391
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,000
I feel the gas stuck in my throat

392
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,720
is gone.

393
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,760
And my stomach isn't swelling anymore.

394
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
The pills must be working.

395
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,280
Qin Shen, it's so nice of you.

396
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,600
I feel like I...

397
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Are you going to leave now?

398
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,280
Or what?

399
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,520
Why are you laughing?

400
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,520
You don't burp?

401
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
It's funny.

402
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,800
Goodbye.

403
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,040
Wait.

404
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,880
What's up?

405
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,560
There are beef noodles every day.

406
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,760
You can go earlier next time.

407
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,880
I was not there for noodles.

408
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,640
I planned to have just a corn.

409
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,040
I ate it because you gave me that

410
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,040
and I didn't want you to be upset.

411
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,120
You did for me?

412
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,960
Don't think too much.

413
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm not...

414
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,880
Forget it. Bye.

415
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,760
Mr. Lin.

416
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,000
Hello.

417
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
This is Yuan Qian.

418
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,720
What's wrong?

419
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,960
I have a question.

420
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,640
I only worked 3 days this month.

421
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,240
Why did I receive the salary for half a month?

422
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,320
Is there a mistake?

423
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,400
No.

424
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,440
How can I not pay you?

425
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,200
You were irresponsible

426
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,600
and just quit, right?

427
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,400
But, if I don't pay you,

428
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,640
someone may tell the president

429
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
that I wasn't good to you.

430
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,040
The president?

431
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,680
I know

432
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
you are a friend of Mr. Ling's daughter.

433
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,840
Who is Mr. Ling's daughter?

434
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,800
Don't tell me you don't know Ling Wei.

435
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,120
I... I see.

436
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,400
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

437
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
What's up?

438
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,960
I just knew

439
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,080
I got that job

440
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,120
because Ling Wei's father was the president.

441
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
I owe her a big one.

442
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,280
Yeah, you have to get it even.

443
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,040
What if you become Qin Shen's girlfriend?

444
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,800
I didn't mean that.

445
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,760
It's not that I have to get it even with her.

446
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,040
It's a little strange if you just hive her the money.

447
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
And she won't accept it.

448
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,960
Then what can I do?

449
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,200
How about

450
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,360
going to he store

451
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
and buy a gift for her?

452
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,600
It looks good and you can pay her back with the gift.

453
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,600
But it's is not her birthday nor some festivals.

454
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,960
It's awkward to just give her the gift.

455
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,600
At least I have to find a decent reason.

456
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,600
To celebrate for your more than 18 years of life being single.

457
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I on my way.

458
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,400
To celebrate for the peace of the world,

459
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,440
I will buy her a gift.

460
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,480
Here you are.

461
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,560
Thanks.

462
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,760
See you next time.

463
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,240
Hello.

464
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,280
Where are you?

465
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Lintai Square.

466
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,520
What's up?

467
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,480
Which floor?

468
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,400
The fourth.

469
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
Okay, stay there.

470
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,960
I will show up in two minutes.

471
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,680
Why are you here?

472
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,760
Let's go.

473
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,240
I will buy you your birthday gift.

474
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,440
I have to leave for a competition in couple days.

475
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,400
So I won't have time to celebrate your birthday.

476
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,760
But I can't go without giving you the present.

477
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,960
You winning the competition

478
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,680
will be the best gift for me.

479
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,320
Of course I will win,

480
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,160
but I still have to buy you a gift.

481
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
Let's go pick something.

482
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,640
I will buy you whatever you want.

483
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,880
I...

484
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,000
Let's go. Let's go.

485
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,040
Welcome.

486
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
This looks good.

487
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,360
Don't you like it?

488
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,040
How about this one?

489
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,320
This?

490
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,880
It doesn't looks good on me.

491
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,600
Song Siyi.

492
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,200
What can I help you?

493
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,600
Can I take a look at this one?

494
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,120
Okay.

495
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,440
Here you are.

496
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,080
Thanks.

497
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,960
This looks good.

498
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,360
I like it.

499
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,600
Okay.

500
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,400
That's the one.

501
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What again, bro?

502
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Now you have your present,

503
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
and I don't have time to celebrate it with you.

504
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,200
Can you put this on for me?

505
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,560
Come on. There are a lot of people here.

506
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,280
I don't care.

507
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,640
I won't let you go if you don't put it on.

508
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Are you happy now?

509
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,560
What are you doing?

510
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,720
I want to remember your look by this photo.

511
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,080
When I miss you, I can look at it.

512
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,760
Come on. Stop it!

513
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,640
I am going to be angry!

514
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,640
Stop!

515
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,880
Qin Shen.

516
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,280
Is this for me?

517
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,920
Apple cider vinegar.

518
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
It works on flatulence.

519
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,240
Well.

520
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,960
You!

521
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,040
Sour.

522
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,880
Very sour.

523
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,280
It seems Qin Shen is the same as me.

524
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Song Siyi.

525
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,000
You misunderstood us

526
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,960
for what happened today.

527
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
I happen to meet Song Siyi in the mall,

528
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,840
then we came back together.

529
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,520
He'll leave for a competition so he bought me a present.

530
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,200
He wanted to take the photo

531
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,600
but I didn't agree.

532
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,960
So I took his phone.

533
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,720
That's all.

534
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,440
Hello, Ms.

535
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
Hello, Yuan Qian.

536
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,320
I am off duty now.

537
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,720
And I will pass by your dormitory.

538
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Come downstairs

539
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,800
and get your transference exam notification.

540
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,480
Right now?

541
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,240
Yep.

542
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,440
Come down now.

543
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,240
Okay. One minute.

544
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,840
Thank you, Ms.

545
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,840
Yuan Qian,

546
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,600
are you going back to dorm?

547
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
Why are you so flurried?

548
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,800
I... I ran back.

549
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,400
I was panting.

550
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,760
I got the important thing to do.

551
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,120
Come in.

552
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,880
Yuan Qian.

553
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,920
Come in.

554
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,160
You are organizing?

555
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,240
It was messy, so I want to clean them up.

556
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,200
This is for you.

557
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
It's not my birthday

558
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,440
nor any kind of festival.

559
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,480
Why do you give me a gift?

560
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,760
You don't want to be my friend anymore?

561
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,400
No.

562
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,200
I just want to thank you for helping me get the job.

563
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,200
You don't want to owe me

564
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,840
so you must get it even with me?

565
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,640
You helped me.

566
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,040
I want to return your favor.

567
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,000
Yuan Qian.

568
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,760
I thought about

569
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,080
that thing,

570
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,680
and you were right.

571
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,480
I made my choice by not doing anything.

572
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,000
I chose to protect Dai Yaqing.

573
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,280
But, you know,

574
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,600
I am the only friend of Yaqing's.

575
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,840
I have to help her.

576
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,040
It's OK. I understand.

577
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,520
I will accept it then.

578
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,320
Thanks.

579
00:37:17,224 --> 00:37:19,232
For depression.

580
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,400
Ling Wei.

581
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,680
Are you ill?

582
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,320
When

583
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,520
did you get it?

584
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,240
It's nothing.

585
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,440
My family worried about me and asked me to see the doctor.

586
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,840
But I don't think it's any serious.

587
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,680
I am fine.

588
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,920
Don't worry about me.

589
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,680
Have some good rest and take care of yourself.

590
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,880
I have to go.

591
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,680
Goodbye.

592
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,640
How deep is her love for Qin Shen

593
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,520
that she even got the depression?

594
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,960
It's beyond my imagination.

595
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,080
Stop it. Keep studying.

596
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Don't you want to change your major or not?

597
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,320
Xinxin,

598
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,040
remember to put away your books,

599
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,600
or you will forget where you put it.

600
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,480
Okay.

601
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,360
Where should be go for Yuan Qian's birthday?

602
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,880
Let's find a good restaurant,

603
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,400
and we can go to the karaoke after it.

604
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,800
If not karaoke,

605
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,760
we can go to the cinema.

606
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,640
Okay.

607
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,160
Is Yuan Qian here?

608
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,200
No.

609
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:58,960
What's up?

610
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,400
She came to give me the gift

611
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,480
but left her transference exam notification

612
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,560
in the gift bag.

613
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,040
I just saw it.

614
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,120
Alright. You got it now.

615
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,480
Please hand it over to her.

616
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,640
I have to go.

617
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,480
It is too hot today.

618
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,120
It is getting hotter and hotter.

619
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,840
What the matter with you all?

620
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,320
What's the look?

621
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,200
What happened?

622
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,160
Yuan Qian,

623
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,640
are you hiding something from us?

624
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,480
Me?

625
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,920
What can I hide you?

626
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,000
You left it in the gift bag.

627
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Take good care of it.

628
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,920
This is...?

629
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,440
Are you planning to let us know

630
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,360
when you move out

631
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,360
if we don't see it?

632
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,800
Tell us,

633
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,160
are we your friends?

634
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,800
Why didn't you tell us?

635
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,120
What you did makes me really angry.

636
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,760
We are discussing how to celebrate your birthday,

637
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,880
yet you're planning to change your major!

638
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,400
Yuan Qian, is it because of me?

639
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,640
No. No. No.

640
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,160
Listen to me.

641
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,600
I wanted it when the semester started.

642
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,920
I was reassigned to the sculpture department,

643
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,640
and I wanted to learn oil painting.

644
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,520
Look.

645
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,000
Before the rumors was spreading,

646
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,120
I started to learn oil painting myself

647
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
for changing my major.

648
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,240
Your answer is excellent.

649
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,200
More than we can imagine.

650
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,920
It turns out you wanted to leave in the first place.

651
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,280
It's too much!

652
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,040
This is a total betrayal.

653
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,680
You hurt my feeling,

654
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
and I can't forgive you for it.

655
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,760
Xinxin.

656
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,120
We can't, too.
