1
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,970
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,040
Episode 08

3
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Are you stupid?

4
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
I am Zhang Yi. Save me!

5
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
You are very close to us now.

6
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
Find the last key,

7
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,440
and we can go out.

8
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,400
Do not give up.

9
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,160
Please pay attention to every detail.

10
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Remember,

11
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,120
if you can not find the key,

12
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,720
you will be like us,

13
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,960
staying here forever.

14
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,120
That's bad.

15
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,280
What should we do?

16
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,080
Did that mean we couldn't get out?

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,520
I can understand Chinese.

18
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280
By the way, Luo Xinxin!

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,920
Luo Xinxin!

20
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,600
Chen Qinan!

21
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,240
Where are you?

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,960
Stop shouting. They won't come out.

23
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,200
Why?

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
We have found six keys.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
But we never met them.

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
They should have been out long ago.

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,360
Why?

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,120
Maybe they thought

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,720
you have some thoughts on me.

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,080
So they wanted to help you.

31
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
I didn't!

32
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,760
Let's find a way to get out first.

33
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,240
When I go out, I must fight Luo Xinxin!

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
We can't just sit and wait like this.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,120
Let's find clues quickly

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,840
Often the most conspicuous place

37
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,760
is where we easily overlook.

38
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,600
There are not so many good things

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
in this room,

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
except these two.

41
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,160
It seems that the key of going out lies in them.

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,320
You sure?

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,640
This is just a smart bracelet.

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,760
We should fine the switch to trigger it,

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,400
to open this box.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,760
Nothing at all.

47
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,240
It's on.

48
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,200
I told you it's just a smart bracelet.

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,880
My heartbeat is 98.

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,400
I seem to be in a good health.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,240
We should let the heart rate to raise to a certain extent.

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,440
Try running in place?

53
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,880
Me?

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,680
You should do that.

55
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,280
I exercise all year round,

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,640
so my heart rate is lower than average.

57
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
You should try to get 140 first.

58
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,600
Without enough aerobic exercise,

59
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
your heart rate can't be elevated.

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
What to do then?

61
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,880
Come here.

62
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,040
Congratulations on passing the last level.

63
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,840
Please get the 7th key from the box

64
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
to rescue Zhang Yi and his teammates.

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,200
At the same time you will leave safely.

66
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Don't wanna go?

67
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,080
That's really weird.

68
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,840
Luo Xinxin and Chen Qinan went to buy milk tea.

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,760
But they have gone for so long,

70
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
and they went themselves.

71
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,960
I guess they have gone back.

72
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Why?

73
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,560
She wanted to match us up.

74
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,480
Why?

75
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,360
We are not...

76
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,080
not, well...

77
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
I think

78
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,480
the official match is the best.

79
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,440
If I had known it would be like this,

80
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
I wouldn't come here.

81
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,240
I was...

82
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
I knew you're here for the major-changing application form.

83
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,800
It's not.

84
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,600
It's... It's kind of true.

85
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,600
Why are you laughing?

86
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,560
It's nothing.

87
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,320
Let's go.

88
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,440
Okay.

89
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,760
Come and have a look.

90
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,720
This is very unique!

91
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
What is this?

92
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,600
Come and have a look.

93
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:29,900
It's close. Just nearby.

94
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,100
Tiantang Hotel
It's close. Just nearby.

95
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,320
It's close. Just nearby.

96
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,480
You must come.

97
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,760
It's too late.

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Don't know if we can make it back to the dormitory.

99
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,080
We can.

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,520
Let's take a taxi back.

101
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,680
It's the only choice.

102
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,040
Taxi!

103
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,400
Yuan Qian!

104
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,840
What's wrong? Why are you still out?

105
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,080
It's gonna be locked. Do you want to sleep outside?

106
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,640
I'm on the taxi now.

107
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,480
The driver told us he would hurry.

108
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay, come back quickly.

109
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,680
The dormitory will be closed soon.

110
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,240
Excuse me,

111
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
are there bridges on our way back to school?

112
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
This is a high-way.

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,560
I took the wrong road.

114
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Why are we on the high-way?

115
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,760
Well.

116
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,680
What should we do?

117
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
We need to go back to school.

118
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,160
It's okay.

119
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,480
We can turn around ahead.

120
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
The next intersection is sixty kilometers away.

121
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,440
What should I do?

122
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,240
That's an accident.

123
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,120
Girl.

124
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,920
Look at the time!

125
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
The date made you forget the time?

126
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,680
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
We are not...

128
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,960
Sign here.

129
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,880
Do I have to?

130
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,320
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up!

131
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,880
Hurry up.

132
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,960
Come in.

133
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,440
Yuan Qian.

134
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,760
Why are you so late?

135
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,640
The driver went on the wrong way.

136
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,840
I thought you two would be outside tonight.

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Put away your erotic waste.

138
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,800
And I'm not done with you yet.

139
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,360
Why did you leave me alone without saying a word?

140
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Don't you feel guilty for it?

141
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,120
Say in all honesty.

142
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,280
I did it totally

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,200
for your life-long happiness.

144
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,440
So you say it!

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
There's nothing between us.

146
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,040
You sure?

147
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
Stop messing around.

148
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,720
There's really nothing.

149
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,480
Qin Shen asked me to keep the key.

150
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,840
But why did I put it in the bag?

151
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,200
What happened?

152
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,040
Nothing.

153
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,480
Qin!

154
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,120
I thought we were lost.

155
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,920
So we...

156
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,960
Are you angry with us?

157
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,160
Angry?

158
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,880
I... I ran away...

159
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,440
No.

160
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,480
I came back first because

161
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
we were lost.

162
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,880
Did you and Yuan Qian...

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,760
Eat your grass.

164
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,400
What's about her?

165
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
Qin, you looks happy.

166
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,120
What are you doing?

167
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,160
Cleaning for Spring Festival?

168
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,440
Yuan Qian.

169
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,480
You're right on time.

170
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,320
Help me clean the windows over there.

171
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,120
- I'll go help in the next building. - Wait.

172
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,120
What's this?

173
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,000
It's the clean-up day.

174
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,400
Every room will be evaluated,

175
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,200
so all the classes are canceled for the clean-up.

176
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,760
But we're only responsible for this building.

177
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
It's not within our responsibility,

178
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
but it is of those helpless girls

179
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,040
from the Dance Department.

180
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,320
For those girls,

181
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,240
I decided to sacrifice myself

182
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,200
and leave you the job of cleaning the window.

183
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,760
You are welcome.

184
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,280
Bye-bye!

185
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,120
Wait!

186
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,600
What a swift move! Like a pond louch.

187
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,360
Liu Chengren!

188
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,120
Pass it to me, please.

189
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,600
Thank you!

190
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,360
You just brought a big bucket of dirty water?

191
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,680
No. Chen Qinan...

192
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,600
...gave it to me.

193
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,520
I will go change it.

194
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,120
Are you sure you cleaned it,

195
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,200
and didn't change a new one?

196
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,200
This is the basic.

197
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,240
Don't be perfunctory.

198
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,040
You're asking too much.

199
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,240
Please.

200
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,480
Are you alright?

201
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,320
Yes.

202
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,040
I'll clean that side.

203
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,400
Everyone!

204
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,880
The teacher bought drinks for you.

205
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
Take a break and take some.

206
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,240
Great! Great!

207
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,200
Got it.

208
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
Monitor, I'm going to the toilet.

209
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,680
Go!

210
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,440
- Get one for me! - Bye.

211
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,880
Xuexue!

212
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,080
Thank you.

213
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,520
By the way, your keys are still with me.

214
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,440
I'll bring it to you.

215
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,000
Here you are.

216
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,400
Thank you.

217
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,440
What are you doing?

218
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
Return the keys.

219
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,520
Keys?

220
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,920
What have you two done?

221
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,440
Why are his keys with you?

222
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,560
Chen Qinan.

223
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,560
Don't make up the scandal.

224
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,240
Qin Shen and I.

225
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,600
are purely classmates.

226
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,640
Yuan Qian.

227
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,760
You're drinking Qin's drink.

228
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,560
I'm sorry! I got it wrong.

229
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,600
It's OK.

230
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,000
It's OK?

231
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,480
You were a clean freak and

232
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,880
no one can touch your things.

233
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,160
And now you agree on others using your bottle?

234
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,320
Haven't you said that there are bacteria in the saliva?

235
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,040
The helicobacter pylori?

236
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
I want to drink it, too.

237
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,320
Take it as sour grapes.

238
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,920
I also want to feel how sour it is

239
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,480
with 5 and a half lemons in it.

240
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,520
You're mad because you're embarrassed?

241
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,200
Sorry!

242
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,480
Where are they?

243
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,360
When will you finish washing?

244
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,600
Of course I will wash it until it is clean.

245
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,600
I mean the rag.

246
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,840
I reached the wrong hand.

247
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,000
Bad news!

248
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,640
Yuan Qian.

249
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,520
You are on the notice for coming back late.

250
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,000
Really? Who told you that?

251
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,080
No one need to tell me that.

252
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,560
It is posted on the bulletin board.

253
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,840
I'll go to take a look.

254
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,360
The rag!

255
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
It's the critical time,

256
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,560
and you!

257
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
How could you come back late?

258
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,760
It is difficult to change the major.

259
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,040
And you got the demerit for that.

260
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,160
How can you regain those 5 points?

261
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,160
I don't think you can switch your major.

262
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,560
Just stay in the Sculpture Department.

263
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,200
Shouldn't it be the warning for the first strike,

264
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
and a demerit for the second strike?

265
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,120
Why did I lose 5 points for just this one time?

266
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,440
Are they monsters?

267
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,080
Yuan Qian.

268
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,040
Are you burning incense to someone?

269
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I am mourning

270
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,360
my 5 points.

271
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,040
Straight-A students are all stingy.

272
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Only Qin Shen can compete with you for scholarship,

273
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,280
and he also lost 5 points, OK?

274
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,480
You are still on the same starting line.

275
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,000
Who cares about the scholarship? I just...

276
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,360
Yes I just care about scholarships.

277
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,240
The reporter club has another meeting.

278
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
You have to keep working

279
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,160
with all the worried in mind?

280
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,880
I feel sorry for you.

281
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,520
Just put it here.

282
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,600
- Okay. - Be careful.

283
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,680
Careful.

284
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,120
I have asked.

285
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,000
Replacing the parts requires at least 30,000 yuan.

286
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
The sculling team has always been disappointing,

287
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,840
and they got the last place in every competition.

288
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,480
Now they often need money for repairing the boat.

289
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,040
So they are planning to disband the sculling team.

290
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,520
There may not be any more funding for repairing the boat.

291
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,600
What's everyone's opinion?

292
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,760
They think we can raise some money for it.

293
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,520
8,000 yuan fro each of us.

294
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,560
I agree.

295
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,840
As long as we can win

296
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,560
the "Fast and Furious Cup",

297
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,880
8,000 yuan is nothing.

298
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,640
I think so too.

299
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,920
How about this?

300
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,200
Now our sculling team

301
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,560
can hold it for a while.

302
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,960
During this time, we can raise the money.

303
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,320
If we can win the trial,

304
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,880
I will fix the boat.

305
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,800
But if we can't win the trial,

306
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,960
we'll see what to do according to the funding.

307
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,920
Okay.

308
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,040
Let's start training today.

309
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,320
Let the others know.

310
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,200
You got the time

311
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,280
to see me training?

312
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,560
How do you know that I have the time?

313
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
Using my eyes.

314
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,360
You are not busy today?

315
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,360
I am.

316
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,040
I am going to train.

317
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,800
Would you like to be our audience

318
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,000
and cheer for us?

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,320
No. I have my plans.

320
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,920
You are from the reporter club?

321
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,160
The reporter club

322
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,960
has an interview with the sculling team today.

323
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,920
You can do the interview.

324
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,320
Thank you.

325
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
I only attend the meetings.

326
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,000
Yuan Qian.

327
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,640
The interviewer has an exam today.

328
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,040
Please take the job and complete the interview.

329
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,920
The outline will be sent to your mailbox.

330
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,920
Did you arrange this?

331
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm not capable of that.

332
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,280
This is probably

333
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,240
the fate.

334
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,200
What fate?

335
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,840
Let me introduce.

336
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,560
This is Li Yuanhang.

337
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,160
The acting captain of our team.

338
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,280
If you have any questions,

339
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
just ask him.

340
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,440
I remember that someone opposed to the interview

341
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,560
when the reporter club asked.

342
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,600
Why are you so active in this?

343
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,160
Is it because of me?

344
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,520
Definitely not.

345
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,720
You are the clearest of who is the reason.

346
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,640
So you have met the one.

347
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,480
All of us

348
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,240
will meet someone in our life.

349
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,440
Let's get started on the interview.

350
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,680
Stop, stop, stop!

351
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,920
How many times have I told you

352
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,440
to put the glue on layer by layer?

353
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,560
Don't rush it.

354
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,160
Look at the pile of glue here.

355
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,080
The mold will be destroyed by this.

356
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,440
They don't know it. You don't know it too?

357
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,080
You guys, come on and fix it.

358
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,520
What?

359
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,160
You're here for Prof. Jin's signature?

360
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,840
Is he in a good mood?

361
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,400
Not really.

362
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,640
It seems he likes you.

363
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,840
And you got points deducted too.

364
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,000
If you ask for his signature,

365
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,800
will he show some mercy and sign for you?

366
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,240
It's just five points.

367
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,920
Why can't you let it go?

368
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,240
I can't switch my major if I lose points in it.

369
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,240
Qin Shen.

370
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,880
Could you give this to Chen Qinan for me?

371
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,560
Just give them to him yourself.

372
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,240
Just a few books. A little help.

373
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,240
I saw you

374
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,080
standing here.

375
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,640
So I want you to help me with it.

376
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,120
Do you have to be like this?

377
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,160
Qin Shen.

378
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,120
I want to make it clear with you.

379
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,280
What?

380
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,000
I was really wayward before.

381
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,720
And I'm sorry that I troubled you.

382
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,960
I have thought a lot during this time.

383
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,960
Maybe, there're things you just can't get it.

384
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,200
I have decided to let it go.

385
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,400
Do not worry.

386
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,120
I won't bother you anymore.

387
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,240
I will wish you happy,

388
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,760
no matter who you'll be with.

389
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
I hope you can stop acting weird

390
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,440
and don't treat me like a pervert every time.

391
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,880
Thank you.

392
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,760
You're welcome.

393
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Why didn't you respond?

394
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,920
How should I respond?

395
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,000
Have fireworks and celebrate it?

396
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,000
At least you should chase her.

397
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,960
She seemed to be in a bad mood.

398
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,560
How about this?

399
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,080
You go ask Prof. Jin for signature,

400
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,760
and I'll help you get Ling Wei back.

401
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,480
No.

402
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,720
I have never liked Ling Wei.

403
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,800
Yuan Qian.

404
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,800
How many grains of rice are in this bowl?

405
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,120
I do not know.

406
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,480
You count and eat one by one.

407
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,480
I thought you were counting rice grains.

408
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,360
You are so out of your mind recently.

409
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,040
It's for Qin Shen?

410
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,760
How is it possible?

411
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm just worrying about

412
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,200
the 5 points deducted.

413
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,160
What to worry about?

414
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,160
Aren't you an assistant in the reporter club?

415
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,360
Wait until the end of the semester,

416
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,120
you can get your 5 points back after the promotion.

417
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,280
Right.

418
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,520
Why haven't I thought about it?

419
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,480
Jianing, you are really my lucky star.

420
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
Of course, I am.

421
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
I have submitted my interview with Song Siyi.

422
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,200
I believe I will be promoted soon.

423
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,840
Come on, eat.

424
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,840
Yuan Qian,

425
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,000
did you read your draft?

426
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,960
It's a complete mass.

427
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
I... I wrote it according to the interview outline.

428
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,280
Do you have to follow the outline?

429
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,560
The sculling team

430
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,640
will go for the trial in the city,

431
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,720
for the National Sculling Race for College Students,

432
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,160
the "Fast and Furious Cup".

433
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,080
We want to publish an interview before the trial.

434
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,640
Your draft is a mess and we can't publish it.

435
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,360
I will contact the rowing team immediately

436
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,520
to do anther interview.

437
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,360
Don't go wrong this time.

438
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,240
What happened?

439
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,800
It's just a slap in the face.

440
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,600
My draft can't be published.

441
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,080
I guess

442
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
I won't be promoted that easily.

443
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,840
Xuanzhou University will win!

444
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,360
Song Siyi. Go! Go! Go!

445
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,200
Xuanzhou University will win!

446
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,400
Song Siyi. Go! Go! Go!

447
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,800
Song Siyi! You're the best!

448
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,400
Xuanzhou University will win!

449
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,160
I have learned about rowing this semester.

450
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,840
I started it last semester.

451
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,920
The others all started from last semester.

452
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,800
Why are you here?

453
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,600
I have to another interview,

454
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,280
Can you help me?

455
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,600
Of course.

456
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,760
But you have to wait after the trial ends.

457
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,320
And now

458
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,960
you have to do me a favor.

459
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,720
You're not asking me, right?

460
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,680
Yes.

461
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,800
I'm not asking you.

462
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,760
Can you do it?

463
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,400
Of course.

464
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,200
I need your help after all.

465
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,000
Thank you.

466
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,600
The "Fast and Furious Cup",

467
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,880
the National Sculling Race for College Students,

468
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,840
the trial of Xuanzhou Division is going to start.

469
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,160
Please take your place, everyone.

470
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,680
You came for an interview too?

471
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,560
Are there any problems?

472
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
But I'm promised

473
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,760
the interview is all mine.

474
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
Your interview

475
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,030
will be in vain.

476
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,080
Yaqing. You are in charge of the interview
with the sculling team. I wanted Yuan Qian to do it,
but I'm afraid something will go wrong.
Finish the script and send it to me. You can do it!
will be in vain.

477
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,760
Yaqing. You are in charge of the interview
with the sculling team. I wanted Yuan Qian to do it,
but I'm afraid something will go wrong.
Finish the script and send it to me. You can do it!

478
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,920
So you brought it up?

479
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,080
You don't need to worry about that,

480
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,120
Anyway, she's afraid something will go wrong,

481
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,520
so I will replace you.

482
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,680
I'll take this chance to learn.

483
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,760
Maybe I can write a good one,

484
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,960
and mine draft will be published.

485
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,600
Right?

486
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,520
I will wait to see your masterpiece.

487
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,320
Congratulations! The sculling team from Xuanzhou University

488
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,240
has won the championship.

489
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,560
Hurry up!

490
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,320
I'm coming!

491
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
So cool!

492
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Song Siyi. You are awesome.

493
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,960
Song Siyi, hello!

494
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,360
Do you accept business interviews?

495
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,320
OK, wait for me.

496
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,040
Congratulations!

497
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
This is just the appetizer.

498
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,520
My target

499
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,440
is this!

500
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,400
World Rowing Championships

501
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,840
I didn't know it before, Song Siyi.

502
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,560
You aim is high.

503
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
Why are you here?

504
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,200
For interviewing you.

505
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,560
I'm assigned the job.

506
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
And I'm a true reporter,

507
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,840
unlike someone,

508
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,160
whose interview will be useless.

509
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,360
My draft failed last time, so I have to do it again.

510
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,880
It's good.

511
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,760
I was too uptight last time,

512
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,400
and I didn't really express myself.

513
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,280
Let's go!

514
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,440
I was talking to Yuan Qian.

515
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,520
Yuan Qian,

516
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,400
let's go.

517
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,600
Please enjoy.

518
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,400
Thank you.

519
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,920
What happened?

520
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Something worries you?

521
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,560
Thank you just now.

522
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,160
I feel like I have used you.

523
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,600
So that's it.

524
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,440
If you are willing to,

525
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,280
you can use me for your life.

526
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,440
But how did you offend Dai Yaqing?

527
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,480
I feel like she's kind of mean to you.

528
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
I guess she is into you.

529
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
She's excited to interview you,

530
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,680
if it's not you, she would have

531
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,240
lots of excuses not to do it.

532
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,080
You are so attractive to girls.

533
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,440
I see.

534
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,040
I don't know what's wrong with the world now.

535
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,600
The one who start it can come out clean,

536
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,000
but others around him have to suffer.

537
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
That means it's very clear that

538
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,880
I treat you different;y.

539
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,880
Thank you.

540
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,800
Please don't treat me differently.

541
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,960
Ungrateful!

542
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,080
Yes, I am.

543
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,240
OK, I will go now.

544
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,120
Yuan Qian.

545
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,080
I have something to deal with.

546
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,400
Can you go back yourself?

547
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,720
What's the matter?

548
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,120
Nothing.

549
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,000
Go back after this.

550
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,240
It's just 5 points.

551
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,040
Why can't you let it go?

552
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,480
I can't switch my major if I lose points in it.

553
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,400
How about this?

554
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,680
You ask for Prof. Jin's signature,

555
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,960
and I'll help you get Ling Wei back.

556
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,480
I heard that Yuan Qian and Song Siyi

557
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,280
have been very close recently.

558
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,920
Interviews and having meals together.

559
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,400
I heard that

560
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,360
Yuan Qian was close to him

561
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,440
because the points she lost.

562
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,680
Qin,

563
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,920
you're close to Pro. Jin,

564
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,160
so it should be easy for you to ask him

565
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,600
for a justification for coming back late.

566
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,080
You have nothing to do?

567
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,920
No, I don't.

568
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,600
I just took them off.

569
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,840
Wash them.

570
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,920
I think

571
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,760
you should be more proactive for the girl.

572
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
If you're not,

573
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,240
others will be.

574
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,520
You're always proactive,

575
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,880
but you rarely receive positive responses.

576
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,920
So being proactive is not necessarily useful.

577
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,520
You just finished on meal. Why are you still eating?

578
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,920
That's the dessert.

579
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,600
Wait.

580
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,640
The latest school newspaper!

581
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,280
Found it!

582
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,160
What're you looking for?

583
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,280
It's weird. Why isn't it published?

584
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,360
Publish what?

585
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,360
Interview with the Sculling Club.

586
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,920
Xinxin, go back.

587
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,360
I'll go to the reporter club.

588
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,560
What?

589
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,720
Where's the president?

590
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,240
She is not here.

591
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,840
Tell me if you have anything.

592
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,160
Yuan Qian.

593
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,400
Hello.

594
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,680
Wasn't the interview draft approved?

595
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Why is it not published?

596
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,320
We don't need it.

597
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,000
Why?

598
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,160
Song Siyi withdrew from the match.

599
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,480
Yuan Qian.

600
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,200
I told you your efforts would be in vain.

601
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,400
But it does not matter.

602
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,120
You can work harder,

603
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,240
striving for another article before this semester ends.

604
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
Maybe you can become the vice president.

605
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,960
Then, you ca interview whoever you want.

606
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,720
Do you know that Song Siyi withdrew from the match?

607
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,960
She is pretty.

608
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,920
Do you know her?

609
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,040
No. No.

610
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,440
Song Siyi.

611
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,920
Everyone says I am your follower.

612
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,080
When it comes to the sculling team,

613
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
you are the first to be mentioned.

614
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,160
I have been living in your shadow.

615
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,760
But I never felt bad about it.

616
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,800
Do you know why?
