1
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,000
Qin, you're back.

2
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
Oh my god, Qin.

3
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,800
What project are you dealing with?

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,080
Why do you get occupational injury?

5
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
What, what happened?

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,440
Your mummy bandage is chic.

7
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
A bowknot?

8
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,320
It's kind of ugly.

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,720
Qin,

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,680
let me bind it up well for you.

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,360
Isn't it binded up by some girl?

12
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,305
It doesn't seem to be a work of medical teachers.

13
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,120
But it seems to be

14
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
a work of a cleaning auntie?

15
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,040
Yi Ming, are you silly?

16
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,880
This shoddy binding must be from

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
some ham-handed

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,760
young girl.

19
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
Such as

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,960
Yuan Qian.

21
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,995
What? It's just a piece of your tissue?

22
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,640
I'm having bone rarefaction recently. Slip of hand.

23
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,520
What's wrong with you?

24
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
Qin,

25
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,160
I find your peachy secret.

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,400
What secret?

27
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,040
I won't tell you.

28
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,520
Tell me about it.

29
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,320
A little secret.

30
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,880
What?

31
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,200
What're you hiding from me?

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,000
Your smile is so sweet.

33
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,280
Yuan Qian, what're you doing?

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,640
Why are you pacing up and down? Military training?

35
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,200
It's so noisy.

36
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,400
No, I'm not.

37
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm just tidying my wardrobe.

38
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,160
Did you put on any makeup?

39
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
Nope.

40
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
I did it in the morning.

41
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
What a good skin you got!

42
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:25,380
The makeup didn't rub off at all for a whole day

43
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,964
and it looks like you had just put it on.

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,840
Really?

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,120
Besides,

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,720
are you going to the dining hall in a while?

47
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,680
Yes.

48
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
You won't order a takeout today

49
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
and will also go to the dining hall?

50
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,360
No.

51
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm sleepy.

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't forget to bring me a meal.

53
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
That's good.

54
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,160
What?

55
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
I said,

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,440
OK.

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,680
Good night.

58
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,400
Isn't my lipstick too rouge?

59
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,760
But it's gorgeous when girls wear dresses.

60
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,280
Qin, help me out!

61
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,960
I'll give your phone back immediately.

62
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,840
Help me out first.

63
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Help... Help me out first!

64
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,520
Give it to me.

65
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,600
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

66
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
Please redial later.

67
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:16,320
Qin.

68
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:17,000
Brother Qin.

69
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,248
Brother Qin. Brother Qin. Brother Qin!

70
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm not like him.

71
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
He'll be fine like this for a week.

72
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,000
But I'm not.

73
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,848
I can't stand, can't lie, can't sit.

74
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:24,690
Your minion me is not fine.

75
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,030
I'm dying!

76
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,000
Would you please help me?

77
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,360
Brother.

78
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,120
Help me out please.

79
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,920
Brother.

80
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,960
Where are you going, brother?

81
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,080
What're you doing?

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,120
Brother, what's it for?

83
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,720
For sending you to hell.

84
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
Brother, no!

85
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,640
You don't eat here,

86
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,880
so you're intentionally come to see me?

87
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,840
I got some issues.

88
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,040
What?

89
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,600
It's none of your business.

90
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,400
Leave me alone. Just go mind your own stuff quickly.

91
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
Staff, meeting!

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
Staff are going to have a meeting.

93
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
Just go.

94
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,160
OK. I'm leaving.

95
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,920
Daddy.

96
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,400
I'll do anything you ask me to from now on.

97
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,800
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

98
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,600
Please redail later.

99
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,720
Qin,

100
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,720
would you please hold my waist for a while.

101
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
It's gonna break.

102
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,608
You can only learn lessons from tirdness.

103
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,880
Are they coming?

104
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
It should be.

105
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Even the firemen are coming.

106
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,120
Look, look, look!

107
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,960
Get out!

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,120
Don't come in!

109
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,240
- Qin! - Nothing to see here!

110
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Let them out, Qin!

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
Don't look at me! Don't!

112
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,120
Don't look at me!

113
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
Nothing to see here!

114
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,513
Get out everyone.

115
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,480
Look, look, look!

116
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,280
Thank you, sir.

117
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,880
What happened?

118
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,840
How did you get in there?

119
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:30,960
Qin,

120
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,160
you are different today.

121
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
This is the 30th time that you

122
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
pick your phone up and put it down.

123
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
You got a date?

124
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,240
No.

125
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,280
Really?

126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,720
Be careful of your head.

127
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,520
My... My head is fine.

128
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,953
There's no handrail that I can't squeeze through.

129
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,040
I can...

130
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
I can easily...

131
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,400
Brother, what are you doing?

132
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,760
My head seems to stuck here.

133
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,480
Chen Qinan, you're really a genius.

134
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,808
Come on!

135
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,030
Let's take a picture of the three of us.

136
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
You! What're you doing?! You!

137
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,440
Yi Ming, put down your phone.

138
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:13,620
Yi Ming, don't take pictures. No!

139
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,680
Please!

140
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,920
Why is your head so big?

141
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,680
Any normal person

142
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
can't get stuck in.

143
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,400
I...

144
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,560
It's not because of the size.

145
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
Try it yourself if you don't believe in me.

146
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,240
OK, I'll try it.

147
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,480
Watch closely.

148
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Look.

149
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't...

150
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,960
I got in.

151
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,440
Then get out.

152
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,240
And I will get...

153
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,040
I, I will...

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,280
It seems I also got stuck.

155
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,393
Stuck in!

156
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,425
Stuck in! Now you can't laugh at me.

157
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,305
Chen Qinan, just wait!

158
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,920
I'll kill you immediately as I get out.

159
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,160
We just wanted to have a try

160
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
and didn't think too much.

161
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,960
You wasted social public resources.

162
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,880
Feeling eggs on your face?

163
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,600
Yes.

164
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,840
Then don't do that again in the future.

165
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,440
You're not children.

166
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,155
You should think twice before you act.

167
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,240
Sorry, sir.

168
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,324
Come on. There's nothing to see.

169
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,200
Go back everyone!

170
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,320
Go, go, go.

171
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,440
Goodbye sir, goodbye.

172
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,680
Stop it. Stop.

173
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
They're quite silly.

174
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
What's the situation?

175
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,680
Bye bye. Bye bye.

176
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,800
You haven't left.

177
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,237
Who're you waiting for?

178
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm not waiting for anyone.

179
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm reading books.

180
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,840
A student of sculpture reading an oil painting book?

181
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,360
It's my interests.

182
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,040
I mean if you have time to waste here,

183
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,520
you might as well go to see my training.

184
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,720
After a while,

185
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:03,381
I will attend

186
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:05,040
the National Sculling Race for College Students.

187
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,600
Do you wanna come

188
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,920
and support me?

189
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
Such an attractive man like you

190
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
won't have anyone to support of?

191
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't want others' support.

192
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I just want yours.

193
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,160
Who're you waiting for today?

194
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,440
Don't ask if it's none of your business.

195
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,880
I've waited for someone before like you.

196
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
When I was young, I once had to move.

197
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,989
She said she definitely would come to see me off.

198
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,080
So it came to me that

199
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,000
I still owed her a game coin.

200
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,760
So I kept waiting.

201
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
But she didn't show up until I left.

202
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,160
Was it this one?

203
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Yes.

204
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,880
It's a pity she didn't come.

205
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Why?

206
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,840
Because she met a neighboring brother when she went out.

207
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,480
He gave her a stick of sugar coated haws.

208
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,320
So she left gaily with him.

209
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,720
Do you think that girl

210
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
has gone too far?

211
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,760
Then may I ask you

212
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,160
how old was she at that time?

213
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,040
The point is not her age.

214
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,480
The point is if that person doesn't care about you,

215
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,200
then the so-called promise

216
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
would just be a tongue-in-cheek.

217
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,240
So today you are...

218
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,760
What did you say just now?

219
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,720
Today...

220
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,560
What...?

221
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,840
I said, you should go back dormitory now.

222
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,720
There's no result even if you keep on waiting.

223
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,760
I'm going back now.

224
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,560
Besides, I didn't wait for anyone.

225
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,440
Sorry! The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

226
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,960
Sorry!

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
Classmates Group.

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yuan Qian.

229
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,710
Friend request sent successfully.

230
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:31,030
Sorry, Chen Qinan and Yi Ming got an emergency.
I helped them and forgot our appointment.
Have you go back to dorm?

231
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,440
Yuan Qian,

232
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,600
where did you go?

233
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
You are so late!

234
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,800
Reading.

235
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Yuan Qian,

236
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,760
did you see firemen on your way back?

237
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
What happened?

238
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
You don't know?

239
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,560
Someone put their head in the handrail

240
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,160
and got stuck.

241
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,800
Just "oh"?

242
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,480
She even didn't laugh.

243
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,120
Right. Where's the meal I asked you to take?

244
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,880
She's unhappy.

245
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,960
Yuan Qian,

246
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,360
you looks so blue tonight.

247
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,760
Anything happened?

248
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,600
No.

249
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,040
My phone's dead.

250
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,040
- Tmall Genie! - SUP?

251
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,320
Tell me,

252
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,560
who's the most beautiful woman in the world?

253
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,080
According to the statistics,

254
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,920
this is the 99th time you ask me this question.

255
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,920
My answer is same as before.

256
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,270
Mirror is a good thing and you should mirror yourself more often.

257
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,920
You little bitch!

258
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,760
Easy, easy, easy.

259
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,300
Sorry, Chen Qinan and Yi Ming got an emergency.
I helped them and forgot our appointment.
Have you go back to dorm?

260
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,880
Qin,

261
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,320
are you tired?

262
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,200
Yi Ming,

263
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,440
have you peeped his secret?

264
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,960
Peep secret?

265
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,560
Right?

266
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm here to just borrow things.

267
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,240
Besides, how can we peep

268
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,160
others' phone?

269
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
Don't you find him a little strange today?

270
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,480
He's checking his phone all the time.

271
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,680
Qin,

272
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,080
you didn't share the pics of our stuck heads

273
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,680
in your moments, did you?

274
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,520
What should we do?

275
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,640
It was really a smack in the face.

276
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
Breaking news! Breaking news!

277
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,560
A great event happened last night!

278
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,360
Just in the boys' dorm!

279
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,320
Nothing happened!

280
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,320
We're living uneventful lives!

281
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,720
Liu Chengren!

282
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
What happened? Yi Ming, Yi Ming what happened?

283
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,880
What happened? What? What happened?

284
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,320
Nothing.

285
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,880
Liu Chengren, move your ass here, here!

286
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,320
Last night I...

287
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,320
You want to talk about the dinner last night?

288
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,210
It's okay.

289
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,480
I just had the dinner incidentally.

290
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I assumed you wouldn't have time. So I left as I finished.

291
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,800
You didn't come, right?

292
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,960
What do you mean?

293
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,240
It's for you.

294
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,000
So this is the gift for apology?

295
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,720
I dug one more pail and it's too much for me.

296
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,120
Yuan Qian,

297
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
can you tell me again the method of

298
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,680
making accurate proportion

299
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,880
that you told me last time?

300
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,000
I forgot.

301
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,040
Sure.

302
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,320
So I'll go there now.

303
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,080
Thank you for the mud you don't need.

304
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,840
This is the second time that you use this pail of mud, right?

305
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,280
It seems to be.

306
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,630
It can't be clenched tightly.

307
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
Did we make troubles last night?

308
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,480
He's weird since he came back.

309
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,000
A weirdo will think everyone is weird.

310
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm serious.

311
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,560
And I'm doing serious things.

312
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Qin.

313
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,240
Professor Jin said, there's a lecture in Pingchuan Campus.

314
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
And he saved you a ticket?

315
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,920
Yes, he did.

316
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,160
Please give it to me.

317
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,080
I want to go.

318
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,280
You're so brilliant. So you don't have to attend lectures.

319
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,640
But Professor Jin does have partiality.

320
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,880
There're only two tickets.

321
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,240
Another ticket went to Yuan Qian.

322
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,820
I think I'm better than her in professional courses.

323
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,160
Really?

324
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,080
Where's your ticket?

325
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,360
I can't find it.

326
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,960
Professor Jin, I had a stomachache unexpectedly

327
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:04,880
and I can't make it today.

328
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,080
I'll give the ticket to my roommate, Xue Congyang.

329
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,480
Xuexue,

330
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,520
you'll go back to see your mom today, right?

331
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,560
It's just near to the Pingchuan Campus.

332
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,800
What about me giving the lecture ticket to you?

333
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
You can listen to the lecture by pass.

334
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,100
The painting is good.

335
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,130
I was called back the moment I arrived in the dorm.

336
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,120
He hasn't arrived?

337
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,680
Guys.

338
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,160
I'll keep it in short.

339
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,370
Each department must give a performance for school anniversary.

340
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,480
What performance shall we have?

341
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Everyone, split it out.

342
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,600
I can be the accompaniment.

343
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,520
Me!

344
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,920
I think we should dance.

345
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,680
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

346
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,040
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

347
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,680
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

348
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,320
Four, two, three, four, five, six.

349
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,720
Actually, it's just fine.

350
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,360
Right?

351
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,920
Anybody knows choreography?

352
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,400
No, next one.

353
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,000
Qin.

354
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
You have many ideas. Give us a suggestion.

355
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,400
My talent is to be a loyal audience.

356
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
Loyal audience, audience.

357
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,880
What, what about you?

358
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,640
Since we are not interested,

359
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,440
what about adopting his dance?

360
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,360
Okay... Agreed, agreed!

361
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,960
Agreed.

362
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,800
Thank you guys.

363
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,720
OK. It goes to you.

364
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
I can really dance.

365
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,240
Hit the music!

366
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,574
We're leaving, leaving, right.

367
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,560
Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.

368
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,560
Bye bye.

369
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,920
I didn't stand you up that day purposely.

370
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:12,440
Don't go if you're against it!

371
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,549
Something happened in my dorm.

372
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,480
Hit the music!

373
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Sorry, got the wrong button.

374
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:21,120
Yuan Qian, let's go.

375
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,640
The milk tea shop is closing, hurry up.

376
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,360
Bye bye. You are so noisy.

377
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
Qin, you think...

378
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,680
Stupid.

379
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,760
Little Shenshen,

380
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:36,410
what about me giving you the center position of dancing?

381
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Qin,

382
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,600
I felt that you don't like me recently, don't you?

383
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,920
I'm glad you know that.

384
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,280
Chen Qinan,

385
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
nobody in our class can dance.

386
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
You raised such a lousy idea,

387
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,560
but who can guide us?

388
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,520
Don't worry.

389
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,480
I can handle it.

390
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,800
Can you?

391
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,520
I have my own way.

392
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,680
My "way" is coming soon.

393
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,040
Ling Wei!

394
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:05,920
Here!

395
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,560
Seriously?

396
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,720
Who am I?

397
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,400
- Is there anything that I can't handle? - Go.

398
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,320
Ling Wei.

399
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,440
Hi, Ling Wei.

400
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,280
Can I sit here?

401
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,600
Won't you sit if I say no?

402
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,280
Of course you can.

403
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,320
If it's necessary, we can let Qin Shen go.

404
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,960
Yes, yes, right.

405
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:30,760
Take a seat, have a sit.

406
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,280
Ling Wei is beautiful and kind.

407
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,888
What a perfect girl.

408
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,200
Ling Wei, thank you very much.

409
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,880
As a monitor, I'm very worried.

410
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,320
But if you could help us,

411
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,320
what about your class?

412
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,760
I won't lead the dance this year.

413
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,010
I'm chosen to be the MC this time.

414
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,520
So I got time to help you practice.

415
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,240
Don't worry.

416
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,160
That's great.

417
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,640
Have a nice chat. I'm leaving.

418
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,200
Qin Shen,

419
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,120
can you have a sense of honor for our class?

420
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Don't always be like an outsider, okay?

421
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,240
Let him go.

422
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,880
He's straightforward.

423
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,200
He knows nothing about

424
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,440
the art of dance.

425
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,720
Be quick.

426
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,640
Come on, guys.

427
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,520
Today we'll do the formal training.

428
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,560
Before the training,

429
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,200
I want to tell you a good news.

430
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,520
We invited a great guider

431
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,280
for our dance this time.

432
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,200
Beautiful.

433
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,000
Professional.

434
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,200
And patient.

435
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,360
Now, let's welcome

436
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,600
the best teacher!

437
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,880
This is Ling Wei,

438
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,360
the Dance Department winner of the Freshman Talent Show

439
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,880
and Art Performance of New Years' Day.

440
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,200
She'll also be our dancing teacher this time.

441
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,040
Let's give our warm welcome! Applause!

442
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,840
I just have a smattering of knowledge.

443
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,080
Please don't mind

444
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,520
if I do something wrong.

445
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,240
Don't be so humble.

446
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
We're very grateful that you came.

447
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,600
OK, let's begin.

448
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,960
Is everyone here?

449
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,520
Qin Shen will be here later.

450
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,160
OK, let's get started.

451
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,720
Let's warm up first.

452
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,680
OK, back to the ranks.

453
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Follow me.

454
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,240
One, two, three, four.

455
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,360
Five, six, seven, eight.

456
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,080
Qianqian.

457
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,440
We have no relations with Dance Department.

458
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,440
Why do we ask Ling Wei here?

459
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,760
Three, two, three, four.

460
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,130
I don't know.

461
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,920
Five, six, seven.

462
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,720
You got a perfect detail.

463
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,440
Good, good, that's good.

464
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,640
You're better than

465
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,280
some senior students I taught.

466
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
So I always say that artist

467
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,280
needs to be gifted.

468
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,280
I'm working hard, too.

469
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
I saw your scores of College Entrance Exams.

470
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
You could have go to a better college.

471
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,120
Why did you come to our college?

472
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,600
Because of the full scholarship.

473
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,360
Do you have any financial issues?

474
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,400
No.

475
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,160
Actually, my mother doesn't want me to learn sculpture.

476
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,200
You persisted even if your mother didn't agree.

477
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,040
You're so treacherous.

478
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,560
She hoped I could learn finance.

479
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,720
Maybe to the ordinary people,

480
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,560
learning sculpture means being unemployed.

481
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,200
But the more violent she against me,

482
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
the more eager I want to show her

483
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,040
that she is wrong.

484
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,760
Not only your mother thinks so.

485
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Our school also wants to

486
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,240
cancel the Department of Sculpture.

487
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,760
It's not easy to be against with the ideas of ordinary people.

488
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,200
Art

489
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,720
is meant to be grasped by the minority.

490
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Come on. Let's have a try.

491
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,680
Don't bend your back.

492
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,120
You must straighten here.

493
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,080
They can all bend down,

494
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,800
so can we.

495
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,670
It's a little hurt. Attention on your breath.

496
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,200
Qin,

497
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,640
when will you come to practice?

498
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,800
I won't go today.

499
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,920
Maybe tomorrow.

500
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,520
Okay. Okay. Okay. I got it.

501
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,550
Draw tiptoes together.

502
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,040
I gotta go.

503
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,200
Draw your feet together, too.

504
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,230
Stretch your hands forward.

505
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,320
Mind your breath.

506
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,040
Ling Wei,

507
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,749
Qin Shen won't make it today.

508
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,840
He may come tomorrow.

509
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,320
It's fine.

510
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,280
We'll just do some stretching exercises today.

511
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,800
Okay.

512
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,012
Since it's our first meeting,

513
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,240
I prepared some presents

514
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,240
for you guys.

515
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,760
Hope you like it.

516
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,640
- Thank you. - Thank you.

517
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,280
Here's yours.

518
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,520
- Thank you. - Thank you.

519
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,600
Here.

520
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,400
Thank you.

521
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,080
Yuan Qian,

522
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
this is for you.

523
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,960
Thank you.

524
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,600
He...

525
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,800
Shouldn't he explain it to me?

526
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,920
Sorry, you've owed 12 yuan already.

527
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,240
You...

528
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,480
I got it wrong. I thought that was mine.

529
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,560
Thank you.

530
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,600
You leave along of the performance of our class,

531
00:34:51,642 --> 00:34:53,322
but to gallant and help the Department of Sculpture.

532
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Why you do this?!

533
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,040
The teacher said I must be the host.

534
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,120
So I won't have much time to practice.

535
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,160
Besides, all of you can dance so well

536
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
and have more time to do rehearsal.

537
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,520
I'm afraid of dragging you down.

538
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,830
The friends majored in Sculpture helped me before.

539
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,640
I can't refuse them.

540
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,200
I'm so sorry.

541
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,080
It's really difficult for you.

542
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,280
Don't worry.

543
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,640
I'm here.

544
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,520
Just prepare the presenter work well.

545
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,520
This can also be an honor for our department.

546
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,800
Is it alright to find another teacher?

547
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,240
They are indeed more professional than me.

548
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,640
I didn't mean that. Don't think too much.

549
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,280
I think Qin's right.

550
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
We shouldn't find one of our same grade and have missions.

551
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,960
Qin Shen?

552
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,680
It was Qin Shen who wanted me out?

553
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,840
No, no, no.

554
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,120
He just gave me a little advice.

555
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,560
He said we may drag your work.

556
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,840
Actually, you didn't.

557
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,680
But I do am occupied like reciting host lines.

558
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,280
So maybe I won't have time to come.

559
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,560
When will the new teacher come?

560
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,720
In a few days.

561
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,480
These days, we still have to bother you.

562
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,280
It's fine.

563
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,720
I'm going there now.

564
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,440
Okay.

565
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,480
Qin Shen,

566
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,040
you show up today.

567
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,560
Are you afraid of delaying my works

568
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,240
so you want me out?

569
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,320
Then can I take it

570
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,120
as you care about me?

571
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,360
Do you think that's what I mean?

572
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,600
You're always like this.

573
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,040
But it's ok.

574
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,400
I'm used to it.

575
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,960
You caught a cold?

576
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,920
Take this.

577
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,471
It contains the VC of five lemons and a half.

578
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,520
It's good for your cold.

579
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,880
I haven't opened it.

580
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,440
No, thanks.

581
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,600
I heard that

582
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,360
firemen visited our dorms a few days ago.

583
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,760
Zhang Mengjie,

584
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,397
does your village just get on to networks?

585
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,480
I wasn't in school that day.

586
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
I heard someone jumped down from a building.

587
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,360
Who?

588
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,080
Jump... Jump down from the building? No.

589
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
It's not.

590
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,040
It's Yi Ming and Chen Qinan.

591
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,480
That day their heads

592
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,680
got stuck in the bedstead.

593
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,200
Shut up and eat your food!

594
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,840
Shut up!

595
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,400
Then,

596
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,560
Qin Shen helped them for hours,

597
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,720
but it didn't work out.

598
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
Finally, he called the fireman

599
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,960
and bailed them out.

600
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,200
This is why Qin Shen didn't show up.

601
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,840
Chen Qinan,

602
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,760
It was you who wasted public resources.

603
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,680
Shut up.

604
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,320
Who're you calling as shut up?

605
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,880
Shut, shut up is not calling someone...

606
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,661
It... It means stop talking.

607
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:27,760
No.

608
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,960
I'm not... I'm not asking you to shut up.

609
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,480
You...

610
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,600
I'm not asking you.

611
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,800
Silly girl, you think yourself as the lubber, the picked one.

612
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,240
You...

613
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,120
My hat, my hat.

614
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,320
Yi Ming, Yi Ming.

615
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,040
Help me.

616
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,600
Yi Ming.

617
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,320
My neck.

618
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,160
Say it again.

619
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,640
Say it again.

620
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,600
I'm sorry, sorry.

621
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,520
I'm the lubber. I'm the lubber.

622
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,640
- Know your sin? - Don't hit me, please.

623
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,400
It hurts, hurts, hurts.

624
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I bought water for everyone.

625
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,600
- Thank you, boss Yuan. - Thank you, boss Yuan.

626
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:08,760
Will it seem decent and natural

627
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,680
if I apologize in this way?

628
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,920
I've been muddled.

629
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,044
I didn't explain and rejected to add him friend.

630
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,520
It's so embarrassed.

631
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,760
Thank you.

632
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,880
Here's one left. I will give it to Qin Shen.

633
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,157
He's in toilet and will be back in a while.

634
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:25,920
No, thanks.

635
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
I can give it to him myself.

636
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,720
Just let me.

637
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,972
Thank you for your love for peers.

638
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,120
Fool.

639
00:38:36,286 --> 00:38:37,480
It's full, full, ok?

640
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,880
Qin,

641
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,400
here, water.

642
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,920
Thanks. I'm not thirsty.

643
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,440
Just take it.

644
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,080
Qin Shen,

645
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,520
You've gone too far.

646
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,560
Yuan Qian saw us practiced too hard,

647
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,880
so she bought the water specially.

648
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,600
It's not only for you.

649
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,680
Why are you...

650
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,040
Qin,

651
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,200
that's a trash can.

652
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,120
You just threw it.

653
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,920
No, I didn't.

654
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,680
Slip of my hand.

655
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,640
Slipped?.

656
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
An unique explaination.

657
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,120
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

658
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,600
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

659
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,880
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

660
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,760
Four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, stop.

661
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,400
Thank you, everyone.

662
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,600
That's the end of today.

663
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,480
Ok, thank you.

664
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,280
Thank you, teacher.

665
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,160
Look! I can stretch!

666
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,320
You like her,

667
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,200
right?

668
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,440
You thought it was me who bought that water.

669
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,680
So you threw it away,

670
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,600
right?

671
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,280
Yuan Qian,

672
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
what're you doing here?

673
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,920
You haven't answered me.
