1
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:33,970
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,632 --> 00:01:37,040
Episode 09

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,440
Song Siyi.

4
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,920
Everyone says I'm like your lackey.

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,360
When it comes to the sculling team,

6
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
everyone will only think of you.

7
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,840
I've been living in your shadow.

8
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,520
But I never felt it's a matter.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,800
Do you know why?

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,560
Because I really like sculling.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
I know that only by following you,

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,880
can I have a chance towards a bigger stage.

13
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,840
Is that what you come to me for?

14
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,400
You leave in early and come back late lately.

15
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,680
And you're often absent from classes.

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,280
What happened to you?

17
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Nothing happened to me.

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
I just find something more interesting.

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,600
That's why you dropped out?

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,240
Yes.

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,760
But why did you find an alternate for

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
the sculling team?

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,600
Why coach him yourself?

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,280
Why do you ask him to cooperate with us

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,320
to win the champion?

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,240
Because I'm always responsible.

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,320
I need to find someone

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
to fill my place after I leave the team.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
Song Siyi, do you think I don't know you?

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
It's OK. It doesn't matter if you don't tell me.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
But I'll find it out one day.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,880
Song Siyi.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,520
I used to follow whatever you said.

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
Except your dropping out,

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,560
I can't leave it to you.

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Look what kind of beginner you find?

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,920
How can he take your place in the match?

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
Song Siyi.

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,800
I've finished the interview draft.

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,840
Take a look.

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,520
No need, throw it away.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,640
You were very cooperative and liked to be

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,520
interviewed that day,

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
and told me kinds of things.

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,520
I just wanted to impress you.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,280
It has nothing to do with sculling.

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,280
Really?

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
When you talk about it, you were happy.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,480
Your joyful face is fake?

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
I was just winking at you.

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
Do whatever you like.

52
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,040
Yuan Qian, it's just Song Siyi.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,560
Do you have to vent like this?

54
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,640
Look how ugly it is.

55
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
It has nothing to do with him.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
Nothing. Nothing.

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,800
Yuan Qian, don't tell me

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,080
you broke into the boys' dorm yesterday

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,240
because of Song Siyi.

60
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,880
I really saw nothing.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
Is it really that scary?

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,840
You have a history.

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,640
Think about what you did

64
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
to our Qin during the gala.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
Why do you make me sound like a pervert.

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,960
I came there for Song Siyi's interview.

67
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,240
Pervert.

68
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
Guys, it's lunch time.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's go eat.

70
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,080
- Yeah. - OK.

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,520
I'm hungry.

72
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,000
We go eat lunch. You eat mud here.

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,120
Go, go.

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,760
Mengjie. Let's go. Have the lunch.

75
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,640
Qin. Come on.

76
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,480
Come on.

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,320
It's too ugly. I'll do it over.

78
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,360
You're upset?

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,200
No.

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
Because of that rowing guy?

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,960
Because of the five points.

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,560
You're upset indeed.

83
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,880
What? You want to change the major?

84
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,160
Sorry.

85
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,680
Prof. Jin, I kept it from you

86
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,280
for fear that you would be mad at me.

87
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,120
After the Gaokao, the major I chose

88
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
was oil painting.

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,600
But I didn't get the right grade

90
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,040
so I was arranged to the Sculpture Department.

91
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,600
Actually, since the first day of school

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,840
I've wanted to change the major,

93
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
not because the Sculpture Department

94
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
will be removed.

95
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,680
Yuan Qian, do you understand your strengths?

96
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,360
You're more talented in sculpture than in oil painting.

97
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,120
I must go to Oil Painting Department.

98
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,960
I've promised that to my dad.

99
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
Are you sure?

100
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,400
Sir.

101
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,120
I came back late the other day

102
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,240
because the driver got the wrong way.

103
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,560
I can't lose my point in Moral Conduct Assessment,

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,560
if I want to change my major.

105
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,120
I know it's hard for you.

106
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,480
But I really have to do it.

107
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
Please sign for me.

108
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,040
Sir, thank you.

109
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,040
And sorry

110
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
for letting you down.

111
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,880
It's okay.

112
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
You can stick to your aim.

113
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,280
I'm very pleased.

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Why do I think he has some difficulties?

115
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
Ms., why is this crossed?

116
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,840
Someone handed in the justification for late return.

117
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,680
Here.

118
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,320
Thank you, Ms..

119
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,000
I saw another justification

120
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,680
for late return from the warden.

121
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,280
You did that?

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,840
So

123
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,920
your want me to help you get Ling Wei back?

124
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,520
It has nothing to do with her.

125
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
It's about me?

126
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,080
That is all because of me.

127
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,880
So I should be responsible for it.

128
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,200
Well, thank you.

129
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,080
Yi Ming, you know,

130
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
I think Qin Shen, the hottest guy in our dorm

131
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,920
will be single all his life.

132
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,760
What happened again?

133
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Yuan Qian came to Qin today.

134
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Turns out that he had already gotten

135
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
the justification for late return for her behind our backs.

136
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,600
She was so moved.

137
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,840
She asked him if he did it for her.

138
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,280
Guess what the straightforward guy said.

139
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,480
What did he say?

140
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,400
He said

141
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
that was all because of me,

142
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,320
so I should be responsible for it.

143
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,960
But I don't think there's anything wrong.

144
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,040
Be more careful in pursuing girls, okay?

145
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,760
She surely wants to hear that he did it

146
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
for her.

147
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,760
I think they're about the same.

148
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,160
I know you like Yuan Qian absolutely.

149
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
I saw it very clearly that day

150
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,280
when you were killing fish.

151
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
Don't try to deny it.

152
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,960
Your fish-killing girl.

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm just being objective.

154
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
I'll wait to see how long you'll pretend?

155
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,680
And you,

156
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,760
you talk about others every day.

157
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,640
I don't see that you have a girlfriend.

158
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,680
Me?

159
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,160
You don't understand.

160
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
I have choices.

161
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,240
You hung out every day,

162
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,720
but you were involved in none of the stories.

163
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,120
Actually,

164
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,680
I once liked the class babe in high school.

165
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,800
Then?

166
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,760
Then.

167
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,200
Then I found

168
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,200
her grade was plain.

169
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
She's always among the last three in the class.

170
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
It was as constant as a mountain.

171
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,000
Wasn't this a pretty good chance?

172
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,000
You could teach her.

173
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,240
No, no, no.

174
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,720
With her grade,

175
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,720
she may not be able to go to colleges with my guidance.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,320
If she marries me in the future,

177
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
the burden of supporting the family

178
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,120
will be totally on me.

179
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,800
So I gave up.

180
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,240
Reasonable. I have nothing to say.

181
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,840
But I suddenly find that Yuan Qian is so cute,

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,920
and gets good grades.

183
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,600
We're totally a win-win combination.

184
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,040
She's now hurt by Qin.

185
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
If I do something to comfort her,

186
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,160
maybe we'll be together.

187
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,560
She's not blind.

188
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,920
He's jealous.

189
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
He's jealous.

190
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,640
Take your hands off.

191
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,120
What?

192
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,320
Take your hands off.

193
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,920
Hands off.

194
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,240
Go.

195
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,800
What?

196
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,560
Do you feel ashamed?

197
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,120
Remember how you shamed me last time?

198
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,080
I'll give it back to you.

199
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
So deadly poor.

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Pretending to be rich to chase girls around.

201
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,560
Do you think no one knows how's your family?

202
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,400
Your mother was a cleaner before.

203
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,880
She fools around with men by her good look.

204
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,040
She's flighty!

205
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,240
How dare you!

206
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
His purpose is to provoke you.

207
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,400
If you go on,

208
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,880
you'll be dismissed.

209
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,560
Come on, beat me.

210
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,280
Come on.

211
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,640
Listen to me,

212
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,760
although my family is poor,

213
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,760
my mom always tells me

214
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,320
a man should be moral.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,680
If I hear you gossip about her again,

216
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,360
I'll never let you off.

217
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,480
And

218
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,480
disgusting!

219
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,760
Do you know Song Siyi?

220
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,600
He's not a rich kid,

221
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,720
just a poor guy.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
And he pretended to be rich

223
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,160
to pursue girls.

224
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Right,

225
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,760
he had a fight with his roommate yesterday.

226
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,280
Really?

227
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,240
He got angry

228
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
just because his roommate disclosed

229
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
that he's a fake.

230
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
He bites off more than he can chew.

231
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,200
- Yeah. - why did he join the sculling team?

232
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,960
Now, he wants to drop out,

233
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,280
getting everyone into trouble.

234
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,840
Some people always wishfully think that

235
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,240
someone else is a rich kid,

236
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,560
and blame him for cheating.

237
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,840
He wears the normal clothes.

238
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,440
His phone is also an old one from last year.

239
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,840
I don't know what made you think he was showing off!

240
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,960
What happened?

241
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,400
I saw Cheng Hao stalking Song Siyi

242
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,720
furtively in the cybercafe at the gate two days ago.

243
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,680
I don't know what he has on Song Siyi.

244
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,640
They had a fight after he came back.

245
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,080
So rumors began to spread.

246
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,000
He stalked Song Siyi?

247
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,240
Sorry.

248
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,280
Wait a second.

249
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,640
7th floor. Thank you.

250
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,120
It's okay.

251
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,960
Song Shiyi.

252
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,520
Song Shiyi.

253
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,360
Song Shiyi.

254
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,400
Qianqian, have you eaten?

255
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,600
Would you like some porridge?

256
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,680
Good, I love your cooking best. Ms.

257
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,400
Where have I seen her?

258
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,680
Ms., are you okay?

259
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,480
I'm okay.

260
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm a little tired. I just need some rest.

261
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,000
That's good.

262
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
You look like

263
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
a neighbor I knew when I was a child.

264
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,080
Are you Zhou?

265
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,000
Did you live on Jiefang Road around 2005?

266
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,600
Are you Yuan Qian?

267
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,640
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
Ms., it's you!

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,480
I was afraid I was wrong.

270
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
It's me.

271
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
Mom, why are you here?

272
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,000
Yuan... Yuan Qian?

273
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,240
You're Mrs. Zhou?

274
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,360
Then you're

275
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,320
Song Shiyi?

276
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,600
Finally!

277
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,880
So you already recognized me.

278
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,800
Then why didn't you tell me?

279
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,240
I misunderstood you every time.

280
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
It's not misunderstanding.

281
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,320
It's prejudice.

282
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Not like that.

283
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,520
Where's my mom?

284
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,240
She goes for a check-up.

285
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
You dropped out because of your mom, right?

286
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
It's not.

287
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,920
Your mom told me all.

288
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,640
There's something wrong with your racing boat.

289
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,520
Repairing needs money.

290
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,680
And the school has no funds.

291
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,120
So you worked hard to make money

292
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,000
and raise money with your teammates.

293
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,320
But Ms. Zhou is ill in hospital suddenly.

294
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,320
So you have to give up sculling.

295
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,680
My mom always exaggerates.

296
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,640
It's not like that.

297
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,280
It's not the first day I know you.

298
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,120
Did you use all the money to pay the hospital bills?

299
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,120
I don't like sculling actually.

300
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,320
I just wanted the bonus.

301
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,680
But now,

302
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,800
it's uncertain to win championship.

303
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,520
And we need a lot of money for repairing

304
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
In that case,

305
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,800
it's better to stop loss in time.

306
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,240
You joined in the sculling match for money?

307
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,920
Right.

308
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,960
I don't like it actually.

309
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,200
Song Shiyi!

310
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,240
Who are you lying to?

311
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,920
You know,

312
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,920
it's not easy

313
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
to have a dream.

314
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,160
If you have any difficulties, let us know.

315
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,760
We'll certainly help you.

316
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,320
You see.

317
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,560
You're lying.

318
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,760
What am I lying about?

319
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,960
Your words just touched my sore spot.

320
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,960
You said I could come to you if I was in trouble.

321
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,160
But you pushed me away

322
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,200
when I needed you,

323
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
and stepped on me.

324
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
Come on.

325
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,840
Never give up.

326
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,760
You can do it!

327
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,240
Song Siyi?

328
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
What's wrong with your foot?

329
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,520
I wondered why you didn't play basketball.

330
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,280
You're with your girlfriend.

331
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,880
Hurry.

332
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,200
Doctors will be off soon.

333
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,360
Ouch. Careful. Careful.

334
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
Ouch. Ouch.

335
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,720
Careful.

336
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,560
Qin Shen, do you hate me?

337
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,440
I'm a patient.

338
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,920
Patient.

339
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,800
You were like pulling a cart.

340
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,400
Qin Shen.

341
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,240
Qin Shen.

342
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
What's the matter?

343
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,960
You're so strange.

344
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Nothing. Take care.

345
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,880
Don't be so rash.

346
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,280
Rash?

347
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
Who knocked me down?

348
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,280
Can you tell me your story?

349
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,200
Do you have wine?

350
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,280
I have water.

351
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,200
I'm thirsty now.

352
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,720
I used it.

353
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,040
I don't mind.

354
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,120
Don't change the topic.

355
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,280
My mother had a sudden attack.

356
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,520
It was found to be heart problems.

357
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,840
The following treatment will certainly cost a lot.

358
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,600
And my family don't have any savings.

359
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,280
The 8,000 yuan I collected

360
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,000
saved my mom's life.

361
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,920
How can I pursue any dream?

362
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,520
Then why don't you tell us that?

363
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,320
I know them well.

364
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,360
If they know the situation of my family,

365
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
they'll give me all the fund

366
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,080
for repairing boat.

367
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,440
I'll hold them back if I stay in the team.

368
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,360
So I think it's better to find someone else

369
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,920
to keep going with them.

370
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,960
Maybe

371
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,680
they want more to fight with you.

372
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,920
Let me lend you some money.

373
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,440
After you get through this period

374
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,240
and train hard to win the championship,

375
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
you'll have money,

376
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,200
as well as fame.

377
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,560
What? You're rich now?

378
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,280
Don't look down on me.

379
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm such a lucky person that I can win a lottery.

380
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,320
OK.

381
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,960
If you win five million,

382
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
don't forget me.

383
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm going to dinner. Are you?

384
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,120
I won't.

385
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,600
I'm going to talk to Li Yuanhang.

386
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,280
You should have a talk.

387
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,680
Qin Shen, give me a hand.

388
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,480
Give me a hand, Qin Shen.

389
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,640
Careful. Careful.

390
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,240
Easy.

391
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,880
What's up?

392
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You want to sit?

393
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,200
Are you sure you have nothing to ask me?

394
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,520
Don't talk while eating or sleeping.

395
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
What did you do in the hospital?

396
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Don't talk while eating or sleeping.

397
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,120
Answer me.

398
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,960
Song Siyi's mother is ill.

399
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
I accompanied her for the check-up.

400
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,920
You know his mother?

401
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,280
We were neighbors when we were kids.

402
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,840
What?

403
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,160
Nothing.

404
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,680
Or

405
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,040
what else do you want to ask me?

406
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,960
Well,

407
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,560
do we have any misunderstanding?

408
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,320
What do I misunderstand you?

409
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,720
You and Song Siyi?

410
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,840
I... don't mean that.

411
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,080
Who are you?

412
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,440
Why should I explain this to you?

413
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,520
I'm thinking

414
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,560
if you have anything else to ask me.

415
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,080
No.

416
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,040
Jia Sicheng.

417
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,760
Ling Wei. What's up?

418
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,120
I want to talk to you.

419
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,320
About Qin Shen?

420
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,960
No.

421
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,320
I'm really sorry about what happened.

422
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,520
I didn't mean it.

423
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,080
You've been hiding from me for over half a year.

424
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,000
I feel guilty, too.

425
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
We shouldn't be like this.

426
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,160
Do you still blame me?

427
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Surely no.

428
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,400
Really?

429
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,960
Then why didn't you answer my call?

430
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,960
My phone is on mute.

431
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,120
And the Sculpture Department is really busy.

432
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,360
Well,

433
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,120
can you stop hiding from me?

434
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,320
Jia Sicheng.

435
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,960
I really regard you

436
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,600
as my pretty important friend.

437
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
You helped me when you saw me get hurt.

438
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,800
You also regard me as a friend, right?

439
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,320
Yes.

440
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,120
Sorry.

441
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,760
I have classes today. I have to go.

442
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,240
Anytime you need me,

443
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,080
just come to me.

444
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,080
OK.

445
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,080
Bye-bye.

446
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,840
Bye.

447
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,000
This one.

448
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,480
Where would you like to move?

449
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,120
Why are you back so early?

450
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,400
Is that guy okay?

451
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He's fine. The bone is fractured.

452
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,560
That's fine?

453
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,520
Nothing

454
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,640
really matters to you.

455
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,640
All right. I'll go to see him another day.

456
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,880
Go on.

457
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,520
OK.

458
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,080
This one.

459
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
If you ask the girl you like

460
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,760
whether she likes you,

461
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,040
and she says no.

462
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,040
What should you do?

463
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,880
Then I'll find another one to like.

464
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,560
Do you want girls anymore?

465
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,360
At this time, you should look at her tenderly and say that

466
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,520
it's okay,

467
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,280
I can teach you how to like me.

468
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,560
What a nonsense. Next.

469
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,400
How to show your affection to the girl you like.

470
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,720
I like you.

471
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,200
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

472
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,440
So cliche!

473
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,440
Give her this.

474
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,360
Menu?

475
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,200
What does it mean?

476
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,920
It's Me-N-U.

477
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,720
Are you sure we can

478
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,400
get girlfriends through this rubbish?

479
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
What are you doing?

480
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Yi Ming wants to find a girlfriend,

481
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,400
and he's learning from me.

482
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,760
No.

483
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,120
Asking Chen Qinan is worse than asking internet.

484
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,920
It is from the internet

485
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,840
What kind of look is it?

486
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,200
I'm a counselor for love anyway.

487
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,520
I just hide my light.

488
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
If I

489
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,280
want to know if a girl likes me,

490
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,080
what should I do?

491
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,960
Girls

492
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,080
are so simple.

493
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,200
Three steps are enough

494
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,320
to know if she likes you.

495
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,080
What are they?

496
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,040
First,

497
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,120
she starts to chat with you.

498
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,000
Chat.

499
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,720
Second,

500
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,920
she'd like to talk about personal topics with you.

501
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,320
Personal topics.

502
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,960
Third,

503
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,720
she'd like to go out with you.

504
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,360
If those are all satisfied,

505
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,600
congratulations.

506
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,640
She's into you.

507
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,040
How can I make sure

508
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,480
that if I'm into her?

509
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,080
Are you stupid?

510
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,040
Don't you know if you like a girl?

511
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,440
Yeah.

512
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,200
Right? Qin.

513
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,960
Let's go on.

514
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Three steps are enough

515
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,880
to know if she likes you.

516
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,640
You...

517
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,440
You first.

518
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,560
You had a part-time job out of the school.

519
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,600
How did you find it?

520
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,280
First, she starts to chat with you.

521
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,760
On the Internet.

522
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,040
Actually,

523
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,840
I'm a bit short of money lately.

524
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,400
I want to find a part-time job.

525
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,240
Do you know how to find a part-time job efficiently?

526
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,600
Search for part-time jobs,

527
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,400
make a call and ask them.

528
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,560
Right, I can call them.

529
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,440
The first gift I received as a child

530
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
as a hand-painted book.

531
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,560
I filled it with colors.

532
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,240
Just Scribbling.

533
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,320
Second,

534
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,880
she'd like to talk about personal topics to you.

535
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,440
Third, she'd like to go out with you.

536
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,280
If those are all satisfied,

537
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,880
congratulations.

538
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,440
She's into you.

539
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,280
There's an art show at the City Art Museum this weekend.

540
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Will you go?

541
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,480
I think I won't go. I'm busy.

542
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,560
I really don't have time recently.

543
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I start to look for part-time jobs online.

544
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,880
How can I have time to be arty?

545
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,880
If you don't look for a part-time job, will you go?

546
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,440
Prof. Jin asked that.

547
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,040
I knew that.

548
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,840
He wants to count attendance.

549
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,400
Bye.

550
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,240
What did I say to offend him?

551
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,240
Ling Wei.

552
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,080
Ling Wei. Don't go.

553
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,200
What do you think about

554
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,960
what I told you before?

555
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,480
Let's eat dinner together.

556
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,240
Sorry. I have plans.

557
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,880
Ling Wei, what about today?

558
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,240
What do you like to eat?

559
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,880
Next time.

560
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,600
What about today?

561
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,240
Ling Wei.

562
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,080
You're going back to the dorm?

563
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,800
Together.

564
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,840
Ling Wei.

565
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,640
Hands off.

566
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,600
Let's eat dinner.

567
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,080
What are you doing?

568
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,320
Cheng Hao.

569
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
What do you want me to do with this photo?

570
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,760
Sending it to the principal

571
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,960
or to your father?

572
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,680
You do this every time.

573
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,520
Can you stop it?

574
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,520
No matter how many times I do it,

575
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,600
it's a good one as long as it's useful.

576
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,480
What do you want?

577
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,440
You always stand on my way,

578
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,560
Don't flatter yourself.

579
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,000
Let's go.

580
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,040
Thank you.

581
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,240
Don't fear him if you meet him again.

582
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,400
He's coward.

583
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,200
In fact, I've refused him politely

584
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,160
many times.

585
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,360
But he's still like this.

586
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,520
Don't be polite to this kind of shameless man.

587
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,680
Be direct and merciless.

588
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,760
Thank you.

589
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,280
Let me treat you to dinner.

590
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,560
Thanks for your help.

591
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,600
It's nothing.

592
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,800
I don't have the time.

593
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,840
I have a job interview.

594
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,320
For a part-time job?

595
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,960
You helped me.

596
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,240
I should help you in return.

597
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,960
My relative's company is recruiting for part-time positions.

598
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,040
Let me recommend you to them.

599
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,000
No, no.

600
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,400
I'm a candidate.

601
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,200
It's my duty.

602
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,760
It's okay.

603
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,520
If your new job isn't good, let me know.

604
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,680
I must repay you.

605
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,840
OK, thank you.

606
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,160
Thank you.

607
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,480
Hello.

608
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,000
Thank you.

609
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,160
Since you like helping people.

610
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,240
Why don't you help me?

611
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,240
I need a girlfriend very much.

612
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
You're so helpful, and hate to see me with other girls.

613
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,240
Why don't you be my girl?

614
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,120
Don't get in my way.

615
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,280
It must be hard to hand out leaflets.

616
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,160
Let me help.

617
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,280
No need.

618
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,440
I help you with leaflets.

619
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,360
Give me.

620
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,560
Here, here.

621
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,120
Hand them out.

622
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,240
Come on. Hand them out.

623
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,640
Disgusting.

624
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,920
Yeah. So what?

625
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,040
Is someone watching you handing out leaflets?

626
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,000
If you're seen throwing these away,

627
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,480
will you be fired?

628
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,960
What?

629
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,400
Who told you she doesn't have a boyfriend?

630
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,680
I haven't broken up with you.

631
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,520
Want it?

632
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,400
Keep it well.

633
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,120
I need you.

634
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,840
You have no time to hand out leaflets.

635
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,560
Clean up the place

636
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,760
before you leave.

637
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,160
Don't stand here. Pick them up.

638
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,080
Why are you here?

639
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,120
Passing by.

640
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,760
Why are you always

641
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,440
where I meet trouble

642
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,640
and save me?

643
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,240
Accident.

644
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,000
I don't like to see men bullying girls.

645
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,280
In fact, he didn't bully me or tease me.

646
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,560
He just resents me.

647
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,480
So I didn't have to do that.

648
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,080
No, no.

649
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,160
You're bright in my heart.

650
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,120
Like a hero just saved a beauty.

651
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,240
Beauty?

652
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,040
I can't believe you're attacking me under this condition.

653
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,680
Let's go.

654
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,920
Hello.

655
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,360
Qin Shen.

656
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,200
Bring me lunch when you come back.

657
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,560
What do you want?

658
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,480
It's up to you.

659
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,400
Go for it!

660
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,400
If you win the match,

661
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,440
should you treat me to a good meal.

662
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,200
Absolutely.

663
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,960
Qin, you come back so soon.

664
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,960
Where's my lunch?

665
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Do you forget it?

666
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Let Yi Ming bring it.

667
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,960
Poor Song Siyi.

668
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
Why don't you wash your hair first?

669
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,960
To see if a cuckoo is living in your hair.

670
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,520
The cuckoo eggs may be all over you.

671
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,600
Go ahead if you have something to say.

672
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,520
Yuan Qian.

673
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,080
You keep her in your heart.

674
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,120
And what?

675
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,120
She has a boyfriend already.

676
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,320
You're just a back-up.

677
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
I heard Qin Shen of her class

678
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,080
ask her to be with him.

679
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,080
You want to take another beating?

680
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,160
Poor man.

681
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,400
I don't want to hear her name

682
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,960
from your mouth again.

683
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,960
And I know best about

684
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
if she has a boyfriend.

685
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,280
Yuan Qian.
