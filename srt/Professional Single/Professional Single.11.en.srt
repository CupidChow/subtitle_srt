1
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,970
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,040
Episode 11

3
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,040
I just want to change a place.

4
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
Don't move.

5
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,480
Qin Shen.

6
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,160
You are so weird along the way.

7
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,600
Do you have something to tell me?

8
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,120
If you have anything, just say it.

9
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,040
There is a turtle on your back.

10
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
What?

11
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,160
Take off your clothes and have a look.

12
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,760
Class is over?

13
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,920
You are at work again?

14
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah.

15
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,240
Why do you sound so tired?

16
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm not.

17
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,640
Why do you call me all of a sudden?

18
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,480
I just want to hear you talk.

19
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,360
Your voice is not quite right.

20
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,280
What's wrong

21
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,680
What happened? Tell me.

22
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,080
I can cover you.

23
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,840
You little chit can cover me?

24
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
You head can't even reach my chin.

25
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
Can you stop calling me

26
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,360
little chit any more?

27
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
I'll have my hair parted in the middle and be the boss!

28
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,440
You can only be my boss.

29
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,160
I'm working.

30
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,200
I'll call you back after work.

31
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,480
OK.

32
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,400
Anyway, don't get discouraged no matter what happens.

33
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
Everything will be fine.

34
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,080
I know.

35
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,400
Get back to your work.

36
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you want to try other colors?

37
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,320
You can use this one.

38
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Are you painting a family?

39
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,240
Yes.

40
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,040
It looks so lively.

41
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
Miss.

42
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,400
What color do you think this cow should have?

43
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
Cow.

44
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,280
We can try yellow.

45
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,120
Don't move.

46
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,320
Pull it a little bit away, or I can't catch it.

47
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Close your eyes then.

48
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
If I close my eyes, how can I catch it?

49
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,400
What should I do then?

50
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
Cover your chest.

51
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,160
Thank you.

52
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,400
You. Out.

53
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,040
Bring the cage.

54
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
You left your phone on the table.

55
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
Thank you.

56
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,920
I can accept this contract.

57
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,280
But there are some terms

58
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,720
I think we can negotiate.

59
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,800
Which one?

60
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,960
This one.

61
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,248
Party B cannot have any relationship or get married

62
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:41,800
in 10 years,

63
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,840
or compensations

64
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,840
of 10 times of training cost should be paid.

65
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,880
I can't change it.

66
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,920
You can add an additional clause.

67
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
How much you put in me,

68
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
I promise to make it back 10 times in 10 years.

69
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,760
How can you promise it?

70
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,320
What we value are the fans attracted

71
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,920
by your appearance.

72
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,240
If my success surpass the influence

73
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,640
of my appearance,

74
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
I can have a relationship, right?

75
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,840
As long as you can make it.

76
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,160
Can you put the term in it now?

77
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,160
I promise,

78
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,240
I will win many races

79
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,960
and you won't lose money.

80
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,560
Kid.

81
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,120
In this world,

82
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,320
everything has its own rule,

83
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
understand?

84
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,840
Sorry.

85
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,760
I also have my own principle.

86
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,480
Yuan Qian.

87
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,720
The children have all left with their parents.

88
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,920
Why are you still here?

89
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
I still have some work to do.

90
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,320
You go.

91
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,120
I'll be off then.

92
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,000
Bye-bye.

93
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,200
Goodbye.

94
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,960
It's rain...

95
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,240
I have to go.

96
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Bye-bye.

97
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,000
Why am I so unlucky today?

98
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,920
It rained all of a sudden.

99
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
I just wanted to tell you

100
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,800
it was raining outside.

101
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,320
Yeah?

102
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,560
You don't have an umbrella?

103
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,120
I didn't watch the weather forecast today.

104
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm good.

105
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,440
The rain will stop soon.

106
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,800
You should go.

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,800
It's raining heavily! Let's use this together.

108
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,880
You don't hide from me anymore?

109
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,480
I wasn't hiding.

110
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,680
The rain is heavy. Let's take a shortcut.

111
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,640
Can we get to the station through this way?

112
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,520
This is a narrow road.

113
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm sorry about that night.

114
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
Which night?

115
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,440
Be careful.

116
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,280
The rain is too heavy.

117
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,920
Let's just take a taxi.

118
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,600
Okay.

119
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,040
I was a little angry that day,

120
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
but I didn't want to match you with Ling Wei.

121
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Actually I...

122
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,520
You should pick it up.

123
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,040
Hello, what's up?

124
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Song Siyi.

125
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,120
I can't rally talk right now.

126
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,760
I'll call you back later. Bye.

127
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,480
Well. Just now...

128
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Here we are.

129
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
You should go.

130
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,240
By the way,

131
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,160
is the book the director gave us with you?

132
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
Hold it for me.

133
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,840
Thank you.

134
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,440
I... I got a question.

135
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,200
What is it?

136
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
Zhang Yuqi seems to listen to you.

137
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,600
How did you

138
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,200
get him under control?

139
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,400
This is a business secret.

140
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,800
Is it?

141
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,360
Alright. Don't tell me.

142
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,720
He didn't want to listen to me.

143
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
He was just afraid.

144
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,680
You hit him?

145
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,040
You didn't?

146
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,760
Then why was he afraid of you?

147
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Charisma.

148
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,000
OK.

149
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,680
Maybe I don't have the chrisma.

150
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Keep trying.

151
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,400
Put the umbrella at the door.

152
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
Qin, where's my umbrella?

153
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,000
I lost it.

154
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,680
Lost it?

155
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,760
You lost the umbrella in that heavy rain?

156
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,960
You lost it but you didn't get wet at all.

157
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,360
Qin, tell me honestly.

158
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,000
What did you do to my umbrella?

159
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,720
I'll give you one tomorrow.

160
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,200
Did you lend my umbrella to someone else?

161
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Girl or boy?

162
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,560
A girl, right?

163
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,160
Who is she?

164
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,840
That's so unfair!

165
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,000
You wooed the girl with my umbrella.

166
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,320
What are you? Devils? Give me a hand!

167
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,720
My waist! My waist!

168
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,160
Yuan Qian, I'm injured!

169
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Sorry. Sorry.

170
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,960
Monitor,

171
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,200
Are you OK?

172
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,160
No!

173
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,920
I was a macho man!

174
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,000
I can't even straighten up my back now.

175
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
A pulled muscle?

176
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,360
It doesn't matter to you.

177
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,360
You should do something to your man!

178
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,360
I... I didn't say who the man is.

179
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,240
Who are you looking at?

180
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
I can look at whoever I want.

181
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,720
Well. Monitor.

182
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Well.

183
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
He hurt his waist himself.

184
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,640
You practically admitted he's your man.

185
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,312
And you was practically explaining to your girl.

186
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,240
How do you explain this?

187
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,720
I have something to do. I gotta go.

188
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,680
OK.

189
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Song Siyi.

190
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,640
Your team has completed the task so soon, too?

191
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,520
What happened to you last night?

192
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,600
Nothing.

193
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Why do you ask?

194
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,960
Then why didn't you answer my phone?

195
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,280
Didn't I text you?

196
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I was busy at that time,

197
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
so I had no time to answer the phone.

198
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,320
There's really nothing?

199
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,200
Little girl shouldn't be so suspicious.

200
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,480
Do you wish something happen to me?

201
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,320
Why do you always hit me? It's hard!

202
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,400
Come on. Show me.

203
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,480
See if it swells.

204
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,400
Come on.

205
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,120
Don't change the subject.

206
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,400
Where did you go last night?

207
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,440
Last night, I wanted to tell you

208
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,680
I had officially resumed training.

209
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
I'm gonna compete at the finals.

210
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Really?

211
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,360
I wanted to tell you in the phone,

212
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
but you didn't have the time.

213
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,200
I couldn't talk yesterday in the car,

214
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,880
and it rained.

215
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Yesterday...

216
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,240
Yuan Qian!

217
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,120
What were you saying?

218
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,640
Did you and Qin Shen come back

219
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,920
sharing an umbrella yesterday?

220
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,680
No.

221
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,680
It must be I mistook someone as you.

222
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,960
I thought they were you at the gate of the school.

223
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,200
Yuan Qian.

224
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
It's Yi Ming's umbrella.

225
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,080
Remember to give it back to him.

226
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,040
This

227
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,840
is a long story.

228
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,240
Yuan Qian.

229
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
Did you do it on purpose at the gym?

230
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,600
Do what？

231
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,680
Call my bluff.

232
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,320
I can't lie.

233
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
That was so embarrassing.

234
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,520
What did you lie about?

235
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,920
It's just...

236
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,320
Forget it.

237
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,800
Anyway, you have called my bluff.

238
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,040
Never mind.

239
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,760
Right,

240
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,880
can you help me return the umbrella to Yi Ming?

241
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:37,512
Director Lin: Yuan Qian. The painting competition is near.
Zhang Yuqi is talented and his parents expect a lot of him.
Please don't give up on him because he is naughty.
You can talk to him and bond with him. Thank you.

242
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,760
The director told me to bond with Zhang Yuqi,

243
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,080
saying that he is very talented,

244
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,640
and his parents expected a lot of him.

245
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,880
I can't give up on him as his teacher.

246
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,320
Maybe I owed him in my last life.

247
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,280
Let me do it.

248
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,840
No way.

249
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,680
I can't make him think he wins.

250
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,800
I have to fight him to the end.

251
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,960
Zhang Yuqi.

252
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,640
I am not here to criticize you.

253
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,800
I just want to ask you

254
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,720
if you want to participate in

255
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,440
a painting competition?

256
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,600
Of course.

257
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
I have signed up.

258
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,520
I am very happy to see you working so hard.

259
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,400
So, in the future,

260
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,840
follow my words,

261
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,920
practice well,

262
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
and prepare for the competition,

263
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
can you do that?

264
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,320
Wait for me. Let me answer the phone.

265
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Mr. Lin.

266
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,800
I remember all you said,

267
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,520
and I'm talking to him now.

268
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,240
Don't worry. I will pay attention.

269
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Goodbye, sir.

270
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,080
Where is he?

271
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,720
Zhang Yuqi, you...

272
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,200
Zhang Yuqi.

273
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,160
Excuse me.

274
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,520
Have you seen Zhang Yuqi in our class?

275
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,480
No.

276
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,640
I guess all the kids have left.

277
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,680
Thank you.

278
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,200
It;s nothing.

279
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,120
Zhang Yuqi!

280
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,840
Zhang Yuqi!

281
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,760
Call his home?

282
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,520
Call the police?

283
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,760
You are so "good"!

284
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,600
I told you to watch him.

285
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,760
He disappeared under your eyes?

286
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,440
Do you know

287
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
how it will affect our school?

288
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,840
I know.

289
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,520
Can we find him first?

290
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm afraid he will leave the school.

291
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,080
Let's check the monitor.

292
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,440
What if something happens to him?

293
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,360
You're worried now?

294
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,520
What did you do before?

295
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,840
Listen!

296
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,200
It won't work no matter who's behind you.

297
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
What?

298
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,040
Mr. Lin, don't worry.

299
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,520
We will find him.

300
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,400
You know where Zhang Yuqi is?

301
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,600
How?

302
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,960
He called you?

303
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,960
I bind his smartwatch to my phone,

304
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,040
and it got GPS.

305
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,040
If it is right,

306
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,760
he should be near the school.

307
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,880
God bless!

308
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,200
Hope he is okay.

309
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
Trust me. He will be fine.

310
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,040
Where are we going?

311
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,000
Follow me.

312
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
What's wrong with her?

313
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,320
Who knows.

314
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,280
She came back yesterday like being bewitched.

315
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,600
She almost lost one of her students,

316
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,080
and she was scolded,

317
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,800
but she is smiling like a fool.

318
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,280
Maybe she lost her mind because of the scolding.

319
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,760
The kid was found, OK?

320
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,680
I say she is crazy for the hero

321
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,200
who saved her.

322
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,320
He found the kid for me.

323
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,720
Isn't it necessary for me

324
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,200
to be grateful?

325
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
No need to explain.

326
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,000
Yuan Qian.

327
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,200
The counselor asked you to go to the office.

328
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,000
Why did she ask me?

329
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,040
A parent of the student in the school you work at

330
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,720
complained about you to our school.

331
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,600
Complain?

332
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,840
The kid was found. Why the complaint then?

333
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,680
Right.

334
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,600
Ma'am.

335
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,320
Yuan Qian.

336
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,160
You want me?

337
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,560
I need to ask you something.

338
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
Did you get into trouble

339
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
during your part-time job?

340
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,560
There's an accident.

341
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,280
It's a critical time for you to change your major.

342
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,920
You got good grades.

343
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,120
Don't let those out-of-school activities interfere with

344
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
the important stuff.

345
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,120
It will be too bad if you can't change your major

346
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
because of some accident,

347
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
isn't it?

348
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,000
I got it.

349
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
OK. Go back.

350
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,280
I believe in you.

351
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,040
Hello.

352
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,080
Zhang's mother?

353
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,200
I have talked with Yuan Qian.

354
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,640
There should be some misunderstanding.

355
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,600
Yuan Qian.

356
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
She didn't do it on purpose.

357
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,240
What are you talking about?

358
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,120
Stop talking about calling the police.

359
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,440
How can it be so serious?

360
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,640
Right?

361
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,600
Exactly.

362
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,800
Please give her a chance,

363
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
alright?

364
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,560
She is just a little girl.

365
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,840
OK?

366
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
Mrs.

367
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
That's it then.

368
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,800
OK. Goodbye.

369
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,520
Go for a walk?

370
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,480
Have you played this?

371
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,360
Have a try?

372
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,480
No.

373
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,040
I have never played this.

374
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Just give it a try.

375
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
It's good way to vent your feelings

376
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,800
when you're upset.

377
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,720
You got the wrong move.

378
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,080
Now it's right.

379
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,920
I do feel better now!

380
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,920
Try again.

381
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,440
OK.

382
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,600
Thank you.

383
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
I don't know

384
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,440
why suddenly I lost it.

385
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,880
I just felt wronged

386
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,160
and I don't like people questioning me.

387
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,360
It's just a small thing, I know.

388
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,160
But do you know

389
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,520
how much efforts have I put into this major changing thing?

390
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,120
I don't want to fail it for this small thing.

391
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,840
So I felt very discouraged.

392
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,480
It's natural for human to having feelings.

393
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,720
Yes.

394
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,480
I'm fine now after venting it all out.

395
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,560
Many of my students will be champions

396
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,520
and they will got a slap in the face.

397
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,320
This is the person I know.

398
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I was just kidding.

399
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,960
It doesn't matter if they win.

400
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,880
Al long as they can have fun painting.

401
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,040
Let's have a meal together.

402
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,920
My treat. For your teaching me how to play darts.

403
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,280
Okay.

404
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,600
You look in good spirits.

405
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,800
Thank you, sir.

406
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,400
Listen.

407
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,200
Brace yourself up and don't make any mistakes.

408
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,680
Of course.

409
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,120
I don't have anyone behind me after all.

410
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
You're humorous now.

411
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,760
So you didn't hold any grudge?

412
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,120
Of course not.

413
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,760
You must be harsh on,

414
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,240
so I can improve.

415
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,440
Go.

416
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,920
Zhang Yuqi, what's wrong?

417
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,400
No... Nothing.

418
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,480
It's so beautiful.

419
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,600
You can do this.

420
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,080
What's up?

421
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,400
It's for you.

422
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:31,288
Miss, I'm sorry!

423
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,000
I have outlined the teaching plan.

424
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,400
You can take a look.

425
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,960
You all are here?

426
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,200
There is a thing

427
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,680
I need to tell you.

428
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,800
I got the result of the painting competition back.

429
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,800
In the children group,

430
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,520
we got 5 third prize,

431
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,120
2 second prize,

432
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,080
and 1 first prize.

433
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,240
All from your class!

434
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,400
Really?

435
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,080
Parents of the fatty

436
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,320
complained that you're uncultivated and not qualified.

437
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,680
But you won a gold award this time.

438
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,880
Let's see what else can they complain about.

439
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,320
By the way,

440
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,680
you two get ready.

441
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
The school is ready to post this good news

442
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,800
on the official website

443
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,520
to show how capable you are

444
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,240
and how qualified you are!

445
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,480
Take the certificate

446
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,360
and take a photoshoot in the classroom.

447
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
The photographer went to change the battery

448
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,200
and told us to wait

449
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,360
Is my face that pretty?

450
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Do you have something to tell me?

451
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,680
Zhang Yuqi said you made a rule with him,

452
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,800
forbidding him to bully me.

453
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,760
Is it true?

454
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,320
Why

455
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,320
do you help me this time?

456
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,080
None of this happened because of you.

457
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,040
Oh? What do you mean?

458
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm done. We can start now.

459
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,480
Let's go.

460
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,120
You haven't answered my question.

461
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,760
We are taking a group photo.

462
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,000
I mean

463
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,080
you can get closer.

464
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,840
Closer.

465
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,680
What are you doing?

466
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,000
Look at the camera.

467
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,320
Three, two, one.

468
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,160
Now.

469
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,600
Look at your happy face.

470
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,880
Have you and Qin Shen

471
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,960
done something...?

472
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,120
What are you talking about?

473
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,680
The photographer was there,

474
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,840
and Ling Wei took us to a meal.

475
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,600
What could possibly happen?

476
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,760
Ling Wei?

477
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,040
Why does he always around you?

478
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,360
She doesn't work at your school.

479
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,200
Why did she always follow you?

480
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,000
She is close to Mr. Lin.

481
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,640
I think she wants to be close to Qin Shen.

482
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,120
Look at the big red book.

483
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,440
And you stand side by side.

484
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,760
If you cut out the bottom part,

485
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,120
it's exactly like a marriage registration photo.

486
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,600
Do you need me to move the Civil Affairs Bureau here?

487
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,520
The photographer told us to get closer.

488
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,120
No need to explain.

489
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:24,344
We have made a great success in the painting competition. Everyone, let's have a dinner together to celebrate for it. Please come to the Taoyunju Restaurant, at 5 pm tomorrow.

490
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,720
Eat together again?

491
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,720
I vomited last time.

492
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,160
I wish I don't have to do this again

493
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,600
when I go to work after graduation.

494
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,680
Will Ling Wei have the dinner with you too?

495
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,760
I think so.

496
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,280
Mr. Lin will call her.

497
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,680
You should dress up,

498
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,240
and don't let her be prettier than you.

499
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,280
Am I sick?

500
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,520
It's Mr. Lin.

501
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,000
Put it on speak.

502
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,120
Hello. Are you with Qin Shen?

503
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,000
When will you arrive?

504
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,840
Ling Wei has already arrived.

505
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,200
You guys should hurry up.

506
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,040
A kid splashed the paint.

507
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,920
What?

508
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,240
Right.

509
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,520
The paint is all over the walls and the ground.

510
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,320
We may not be able to get there.

511
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,400
How is it? Is it serious?

512
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,320
It's OK.

513
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
We will restore the classroom.

514
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,560
We just need some time.

515
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,760
OK. Clean it up.

516
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,120
Or we can't have the class tomorrow.

517
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,080
Okay.

518
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
Goodbye.

519
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,760
You are good at it.

520
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,360
Mr. Lin.

521
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Why haven't Yuan Qian and Qin Shen come yet?

522
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
Something happened in the class. They can't come.

523
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,320
Let's eat.

524
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,120
Come on.

525
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,240
I'll put some meat in it.

526
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,040
Come on, sir.

527
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
Thank you.

528
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,160
Should we go back to school?

529
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,000
Taxi or bus?

530
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,640
Walk.

531
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,840
No way.

532
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,560
It's too far away.

533
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,680
It's still early.

534
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,400
We can't walk no matter how early it is.

535
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,320
Stop it.

536
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,720
Let' take a taxi or a bus.

537
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Ling Wei.

538
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,880
Let's go.

539
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,480
Why...

540
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,120
Why did you hang up my phone?

541
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,600
Where are we?

542
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,120
This is my high school.

543
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,640
Why did you bring me to your high school?

544
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,160
You should come by yourself.

545
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,080
Why do you bring me here?

546
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,360
Just passing by.

547
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,880
Passing by? We have been walking by for half an hour?

548
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,520
This is passing by?

549
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:11,568
Gaokao High Scores

550
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,880
God, Qin Shen.

551
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,240
What?

552
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,920
Is that you on the list?

553
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,440
More than 600 points?

554
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,400
Why do you learn art

555
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,440
with such a high score.

556
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,440
And why did you come to Xuanzhou University?

557
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
To learn sculpture.

558
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,408
Xiao Jing came back and delivered a speech: The Art of Sculpture

559
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,480
Xiao Jing.

560
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,360
This is his back-to-school speech?

561
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,280
I didn't see him last time

562
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,200
when he came to our school.

563
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,840
Can you...?

564
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,880
What?

565
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,280
Can you introduce me to him?

566
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,280
I don't know him.

567
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,080
You should have met him.

568
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,600
I had asked him a question.

569
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,160
You had questions?

570
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,480
I asked him

571
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,480
if my family don't want me to learn it,

572
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,880
should I stick to my decision?

573
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,760
Then what did he say?

574
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,520
He told me

575
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,320
the road of art

576
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,880
should be difficult and lonely.

577
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,000
It is normal not to be understood by ordinary people.

578
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,320
But the most important thing is to stick to it.

579
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
You can stick to it

580
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,120
by doing what should be done.

581
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,040
I wonder what is he like,

582
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,560
and how did he stick to it.

583
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,720
No one understood me

584
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,320
when I decided to change the major.

585
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,040
When I told my parents that I wanted to change my major,

586
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,840
they said it was unnecessary,

587
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200
and there's no difference.

588
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,000
Have you ever thought that

589
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,920
everything is destined?

590
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,520
No.

591
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,440
I was fully prepared,

592
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,280
but I ran into you and I fell into the lake.

593
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,400
I couldn't make it to the exam.

594
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,600
But

595
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,440
I also broke your sculpture.

596
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,720
We are even now.

597
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,400
Maybe, that's fate.

598
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,040
It's fate?

599
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,040
It's all destined?

600
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,960
What did he mean?

601
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
I couldn't take the exam,

602
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,240
and Qin Shen couldn't make it to the first exhibition.

603
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,120
But they are all histories.

604
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,360
My thing is not decided yet.

605
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,280
How can it be fate?

606
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,280
No.

607
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
If I fail to change my major,

608
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,200
his prediction will come true.

609
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,320
I have to change my fate.

610
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,880
And I must pass the major-changing exam.

611
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,720
Yuan Qian.

612
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,720
What are you doing in the middle of night?

613
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,160
I want to study for a while.

614
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,160
You're mad.
