1
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,920
Episode 4

3
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,840
I can't believe we're waiting

4
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,280
for an old lady like this

5
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,640
on the street.

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,000
We have the limited budget

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
so we can't afford younger models.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,040
It's all your fault.

9
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,160
You made me looks bad in front of Prof. Jin.

10
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,440
Or I wouldn't have to meet the model

11
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,480
to impress him.

12
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,960
So that's why you're doing this.

13
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,280
Or what?

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,400
I must repair my

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
my damaged reputation in his heart.

16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
So I promised to find the model,

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,480
and meet the model.

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,160
I also fawned on Qin Shen

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,120
and even gave him my hand cream.

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
The worst result is losing your scholarship.

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,280
Crap!

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
The model said she couldn't come.

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,680
It's too cold,

24
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,520
and she may get ill.

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,040
I...

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,840
Why are you back?

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,160
Didn't you go helping Prof. Jin?

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,120
Don't worry, we're....

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,400
Why...

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,080
Why is he angry again? Why?

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,360
Who knows?

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,040
Think about what to do with your model.

33
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
What else can I do with it?

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,480
I can only beg Prof. Jin for forgiveness.

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,240
You've suffered so much for looking for a model.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Right?

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
You've helped a lot.

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,480
Where's the model?

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
Why hasn't she come yet?

40
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,000
She...

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,600
Prof. Jin.

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,360
Sir, the model is in the next room.

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,800
We can start anytime.

45
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
OK. Good job.

46
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,800
What trouble did you make again?

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
I want to go to the toilet.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,800
Wait for a while.

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,520
Let me tell you something before class.

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,720
There's a project.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,880
Theme Park.

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,680
Design and production.

53
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,240
I want you to practice.

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,080
There are 3 places.

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,760
I hope you'll strive for it.

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,800
No problem.

57
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
Who are you drawing?

58
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,160
Liu Chengren.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,720
Why don't you draw me?

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
- Who will get in? - Will you go?

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,880
Sure.

62
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,640
Qin.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,720
And you.

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,080
And you.

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,680
Thank you for that.

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
What did you tell the model?

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,200
She said firmly that she wouldn't come.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,440
Use my brain.

69
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
Well...

70
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Yuan Qian.

71
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,760
Your gift is

72
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
really special.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
Although Qin is a little inhumane,

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680
you're biting the hand that feeds you.

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
Not coming?

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,720
Right away.

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,240
Bye-bye.

78
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
Yuan Qian.

79
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,960
Did you

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,360
spray Qin Shen with a faucet on purpose?

81
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Am I crazy to do that?

82
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,680
Qin Shen is too petty.

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
He's wet all over.

84
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,680
But he didn't take off his clothes.

85
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,440
Is he afraid that

86
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,320
we'll see his body?

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Consider your words.

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,400
Are you in a right mind?

89
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
Yuan Qian.

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,560
Do you have problems with Qin Shen?

91
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,440
In such a short time,

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
both of you got wet again.

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
Did he catch the cold?

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,280
This is such a good piece of work.

95
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,920
What's up?

96
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,280
I want to say

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,720
my clothes got wet,

98
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
but it's blow dried by the fan.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,320
What about giving me your shirt

100
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,200
and I'll dry it for you?

101
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,360
I really don't mean to do anything to you.

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,520
I just feel sorry for getting you wet.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
No need.

104
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,880
And the buns are delicious.

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,720
You have a cold?

106
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,680
We should play basketball more.

107
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,080
It can surely cure the cold.

108
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,760
I played it every time I caught the cold.

109
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,920
I would sweat and my fever would be gone.

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,400
Although you don't want my help,

111
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm just like you.

112
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
I don't like to be in debt.

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
Take this as my apology.

114
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,960
Sugarcane juice with couchgrass root is good for you.

115
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,040
And sorry about that.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,720
Thank you, but I don't need this.

117
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,600
Qin. Why?

118
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200
How could you reject her kindness?

119
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,560
I don't like couch grass root.

120
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,120
Then we can take it out.

121
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,440
I don't like sugarcane juice, either.

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Qin.

123
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,160
You're not slow in this anymore,

124
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,880
you just can't move.

125
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
One-person statue.

126
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,400
She holds the head high,

127
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
clenches the teeth and glares at the enemy.

128
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
On the side

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
are clenching fists,

130
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,080
representing her anger at the enemy.

131
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
The back is simple.

132
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,960
On the back is Liu Hulan's hair

133
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
and her clothes pattern.

134
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,560
A quick quiz.

135
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
Whose work is this?

136
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,040
What's the name?

137
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,320
Don't tell me you don't know.

138
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,040
You've learned that in the basic course last semester.

139
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,720
Rodin. The Burghers of Calais.

140
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Look at this one.

141
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,360
Whose work is this? What's the name?

142
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,000
This...

143
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,960
is called...

144
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,840
I have to use everything I know

145
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,640
to change his mind?

146
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,960
Yuan Qian.

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,240
Meleager with the Calydonian Boar.

148
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,400
Some of you

149
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,320
has this bad habit.

150
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,360
You don't draw the medial axis or the dividing lines.

151
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,320
First, draw the medial axis and the dividing lines.

152
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,400
Westerners have higher brow bridges,

153
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,440
and deep eye socket.

154
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,160
You should put the eyes deeper inside.

155
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,880
You can put the eyes

156
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
of the orientals shallower.

157
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,280
Do you get it?

158
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,120
Today's homework is

159
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
a sketch comparing the eyes of westerners and easterners.

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,520
OK.

161
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,640
That's all for today. Class dismissed.

162
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,600
Goodbye, sir.

163
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,280
Goodbye, sir.

164
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,400
Qin Shen.

165
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,560
Jia Sicheng.

166
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,920
Yuan Qian.

167
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,800
Come to my office.

168
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,000
The project for the theme park.

169
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,600
Thank you.

170
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,520
I think you

171
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,520
love sculpture the most in our class.

172
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,800
So I want to give you

173
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,920
a chance to practice it.

174
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
Are you interested?

175
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,600
Thank you, sir. I'm very into it.

176
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
I have to prepare for the exam.

177
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,400
How can I take the time to do the project?

178
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,120
But if I refuse it,

179
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,840
will I leave a worse impression to Prof. Jin?

180
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,200
What about you two?

181
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,960
Sir.

182
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,480
I think this is a great opportunity.

183
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,800
But my ability is limited.

184
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm afraid that I'll hold you back.

185
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,400
So count me out?

186
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,240
Listen to me.

187
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,560
Being too modest means you're proud. You know?

188
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
Your last chance. Join in or not?

189
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,040
Then I'll go. I'll join in it.

190
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm sorry to trouble you later.

191
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,280
Don't be so tragic.

192
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,680
Listen to me. This project

193
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,240
is under charge of your seniors.

194
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
You can learn a lot there.

195
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,320
Besides,

196
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,200
you can regard it

197
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,840
as a part-time job.

198
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,840
There's a bonus of 3000 yuan after it.

199
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,600
Thank you, sir.

200
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,200
What about you?

201
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,400
Sir, I need some time to think about it.

202
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,680
Think about what?

203
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,920
Do you think you don't have the ability or what?

204
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,840
No.

205
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,360
I have a part-time job.

206
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,720
And I haven't quit yet.

207
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,040
So I need to coordinate it.

208
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,960
Why can't I think of such a good excuse?

209
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Qin.

210
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,800
What did Prof. Jin talk with you today?

211
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,760
It isn't about the theme park, is it?

212
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,040
It's true?

213
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,480
Did you accept it?

214
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Haven't decided yet.

215
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,800
What about Yuan Qian?

216
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,880
She did.

217
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,760
What?

218
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,120
When was it decided?

219
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,080
I'm the monitor. Why don't I know this?

220
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Only you volunteered in the monitor election.

221
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
How come you have the face to say that?

222
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,360
You're just jealous.

223
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,520
What kind of project is it?

224
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
Only straight A students can join in.

225
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,520
It has nothing to do with you.

226
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,760
Straight A?

227
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,400
I'll let you know

228
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,000
who is your boss!

229
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,280
Hi, Dad.

230
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,040
Your mom and I are back to see your grandma.

231
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Have you had dinner?

232
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,880
How are you lately?

233
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,560
Do you have enough money?

234
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,040
I'm fine.

235
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,400
Let us know if it isn't enough.

236
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,640
Don't hold it to yourself.

237
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,480
Honey.

238
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,520
What do you think about what I told you?

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,040
I won't drop out.

240
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,520
You're studying sculpture.

241
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,840
It's a hopeless major.

242
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,520
You will be just like a bricklayer!

243
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,840
Did we bring you up

244
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
to make you a bricklayer?

245
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,760
Come on.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
What's wrong with being a lawyer?

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
It's not bad to study finance, either.

248
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,440
Why do you have to study sculpture?

249
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,000
Mom.

250
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,280
If there's nothing else I'll hand up.

251
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,560
Just you try!

252
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,240
Qin Shen, listen to me.

253
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,400
If you don't drop out and take another Gaokao,

254
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,720
never come back again.

255
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,640
You can make your own living in the future.

256
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,840
OK.

257
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,880
Quarreling with your family?

258
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,400
No.

259
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
It's not a big deal to quarrel with them.

260
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,400
My parents and I often do that.

261
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,120
Call them back, say some good words, and be cutesy.

262
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Everything will be fine.

263
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,160
Cutesy?

264
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
If he can be cutesy,

265
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,720
his parents will go mad first.

266
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,000
- Do you know how to console him? - You're the best.

267
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Qin.

268
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,960
Let's take a lake cruise

269
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,920
this weekend.

270
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,120
Let's take some rest.

271
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,080
No.

272
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Why?

273
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,960
Poor.

274
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Stop kidding me.

275
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,400
You're poor with all the fancy clothes?

276
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,080
Even I won't say I'm poor.

277
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
You're poor for real.

278
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,560
Poor. Pauper.

279
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,880
All right, Qin. Don't think too much.

280
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,000
Professor.

281
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,560
The thing about part-time job is solved.

282
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,640
I can join in.

283
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
Prof. Jin is here.

284
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,720
Hello, sir.

285
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,600
Sir.

286
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,720
These are the ones you talked about?

287
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,960
How can you do this

288
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,040
to these pretty little creatures?

289
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
Prof. Jin.

290
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,680
After us,

291
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,000
they are the next victims?

292
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,080
Don't be that rude.

293
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,640
You don't want to graduate anymore?

294
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,680
Let me introduce for you.

295
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,600
Jia Sicheng. Yuan Qian. Qin Shen.

296
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,760
Nice to meet you.

297
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,360
Sicheng.

298
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,640
You and Zi'ang are in a team.

299
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,000
Yuan Qian.

300
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,600
You're with Xiangnan.

301
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Qin Shen.

302
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,680
You're with Chaofan.

303
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,680
Chaofan is in charge of the project.

304
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,240
If you have any questions,

305
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,600
just ask him.

306
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,120
You three, listen to me.

307
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,200
Don't bully them.

308
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,000
Hear me?

309
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,880
All right.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,760
OK.

311
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Thank you, sir.

312
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,440
Hi, your package.

313
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
Your package.

314
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,720
Put it there.

315
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,560
Xiangnan.

316
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,560
Is there anything else I can do?

317
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,600
Help me to mix a barrel of mud.

318
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,520
There are already three of them.

319
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
You need more?

320
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,920
I was too busy to remember it.

321
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,320
Then help me saw a log.

322
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
20 cm in diameter and 50 cm in length.

323
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,400
All right.

324
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,680
It's this big?

325
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,080
It's for the skeleton.

326
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,600
You know how to saw log, right?

327
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,760
I don't.

328
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,520
It's okay. You can learn it on the Internet.

329
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
It's very easy.

330
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,640
Why don't you go?

331
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,120
Xiangnan.

332
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,240
I'm a freshman

333
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,600
and I never learned how to make a skeleton.

334
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm afraid I'll waste the materials.

335
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,000
How do you want to learn these chores?

336
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,760
There are over 20 people in our class.

337
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
Everyone learns from practice.

338
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
No one is treated in a special way.

339
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,920
Alright.

340
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,760
I'll learn it myself.

341
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,880
The electric saw is heavy.

342
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Sorry.

343
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,440
I didn't expect it's that heavy.

344
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,720
Hands off.

345
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,640
Are you okay?

346
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,240
What are you doing?

347
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,680
Come here. Press it.

348
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,400
What?

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,640
What's the size?

350
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,560
20 cm in diameter and 50 cm in length.

351
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,600
Do you think

352
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,880
we've been doing odd jobs since we're here?

353
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,200
It seems that they are making it difficult for us.

354
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,400
I don't care.

355
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,320
I just come here for money.

356
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,800
I...

357
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,520
I just want to say thank you.

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,120
Sorry.

359
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,120
It's a huge log.

360
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,000
Can she saw it?

361
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I don't except the log will be useful.

362
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,400
All of our statues are for exhibition.

363
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,960
What is prof. thinking?

364
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,280
Why does he ask these freshmen to help?

365
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,840
I can't believe it.

366
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,000
Xiangnan.

367
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,000
The log is done.

368
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,040
It's done so fast.

369
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,720
I didn't expect you can do it in such a short time.

370
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,320
Right.

371
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,360
The studio is out of water.

372
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,960
Can you get some water for us from your dormitory?

373
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,960
We will need it.

374
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Dorm?

375
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,960
It's a little far.

376
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,560
We senior students

377
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,520
have become used to it.

378
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,960
You are a freshman.

379
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I suppose you still need more exercise.

380
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,520
All right. I'll do it myself.

381
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,920
No. No.

382
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,360
I will go. I will go.

383
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,120
Sicheng.

384
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,080
Hello.

385
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,360
Jia Sicheng.

386
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,360
I've been looking for you.

387
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,920
You hid from me every time.

388
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Is it necessary?

389
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,920
I don't need to hide from you.

390
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,680
Why do you think so?

391
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,120
Why

392
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,240
can't we settle our misunderstanding?

393
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Is it your purpose to let him

394
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,080
misunderstood me?

395
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,160
Sorry.

396
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,600
What's the purpose?

397
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,600
And what's the misunderstanding?

398
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,960
I didn't do anything.

399
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Were you

400
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,760
pretending to be nice

401
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,440
to me?

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,160
Ling Wei.

403
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,320
I've been busy with sculpture classes since graduation.

404
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,280
I was busy so I didn't reply to your message.

405
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,040
But I promise you

406
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,040
that I don't have a problem with you.

407
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,760
I loved you

408
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
because I wanted to.

409
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,240
And I respect your choice.

410
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,080
But...

411
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,920
Qin Shen does the project with you?

412
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,240
We're classmates.

413
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
It's normal for us.

414
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,440
Can you help me...?

415
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,400
I have something else to do.

416
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,560
Can I leave now?

417
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,360
OK.

418
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,160
How can we deliver it with such a serious problem?

419
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
The acceptance check is coming.

420
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,320
What should you do?

421
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,960
Yuan Qian.

422
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,600
You bought the paint.

423
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,080
What's going on?

424
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,560
I don't know.

425
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,000
We have been using the same brand.

426
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,760
Why did you change it yourself?

427
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,480
Do you know what does that mean?

428
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,200
It means their qualities are very different.

429
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,800
The paint you said was out of stock.

430
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,000
I changed it under your approval.

431
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,960
On the list are the paints we've used before.

432
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Yuan Qian.

433
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,400
Come here.

434
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
Is it like what he said?

435
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,400
I didn't change the paint myself.

436
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,040
The paints from the same brand

437
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,840
have the same formula.

438
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,560
There can't be such a big difference.

439
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,080
Unless it's fake.

440
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,240
Yuan Qian.

441
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,760
Did you buy it in a small shop

442
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,920
without a business license

443
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,320
just for a low price?

444
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,240
I didn't.

445
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,640
You can't talk black into white.

446
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,360
You asked me to buy it at the school gate.

447
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,840
All right, stop quarreling.

448
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,800
What's the use of all this now?

449
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,720
The most important thing is

450
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,440
how to solve this problem.

451
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Xiangnan.

452
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,640
You said paints are very different.

453
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,600
Then we freshmen

454
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,960
can't be the scapegoat for it.

455
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,080
I did ask you about it,

456
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,880
right?

457
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,920
I can help fix it.

458
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,880
I've learned it.

459
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,360
Don't be too harsh on her.

460
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,920
Everyone may make mistakes.

461
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,040
I just think Xiangnan is right.

462
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,680
Let's think about how to make it up.

463
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,680
It has nothing to do with Yuan Qian.

464
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,880
Did you forget to add curing agent?

465
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,240
That's why the fluidization appears.

466
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,800
How could I make such a low-level mistake?

467
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,960
Really?

468
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,520
There's a barrel of paint left yesterday.

469
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,680
Let's color a sculpture now,

470
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,880
and see if it'll be fluidized tomorrow.

471
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,920
Huang Zi'ang.

472
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,240
Did you forget to add curing agent?

473
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
What's this?

474
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,240
Which of you can color?

475
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,840
Qin Shen, can you?

476
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,600
Well.

477
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm responsible for recoloring.

478
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,720
Qin Shen, help me.

479
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,120
Yuan Qian.

480
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,680
You and Sicheng assist us.

481
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,520
- OK. - OK.

482
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,200
I hope there's still time.

483
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,040
Come on.

484
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,560
Zi'ang.

485
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,120
Xiangnan.

486
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,160
You should behave like seniors.

487
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Xinxin.

488
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,040
I may go back late today.

489
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,720
The work is not qualified.

490
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,320
So we need make it again.

491
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,920
Time is short.

492
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,760
Xiangnan asked me to mix the mud

493
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,120
and let it still.

494
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
You can't do it tomorrow?

495
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,040
What can I do?

496
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
Xiangnan told me to finish it today.

497
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,040
I have to do it.

498
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,040
I can't hold them back.

499
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,560
You can sleep.

500
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,920
Come back as soon as you can then.

501
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
You hang up. My hands are full of mud.

502
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,640
Bye-bye.

503
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Why it's locked?

504
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,920
I'm still here.

505
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,120
Open the door.

506
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,440
Open the door.

507
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,880
Open the door.

508
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,120
I'm still here.

509
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,880
I don't expect the log she sawed will work.

510
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,200
All of our statues are for exhibition.

511
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,640
What is prof. thinking?

512
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,240
The paints from the same brand

513
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,000
have the same formula.

514
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,840
There can't be such a big difference.

515
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,000
Yuan Qian.

516
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,440
Did you buy it

517
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,440
in a small shop

518
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,440
without a business license just for a low price?

519
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,520
Why are you here?

520
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,840
I overslept.

521
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,520
Good job.

522
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,480
Let's get out of here.

523
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,520
Help me open the top one.

524
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,280
It's useless.

525
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,840
Why is it useless?

526
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,800
Open the door, so we can get out.

527
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
I'll do it myself.

528
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,360
It's open. It's open.

529
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,880
It's open.

530
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Get me down right now.

531
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,400
What?

532
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,960
Nothing.

533
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,120
Why didn't you

534
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,480
make it looks better when you held me?

535
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:18,840
What?

536
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,960
Nothing.

537
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,320
Let's go.

538
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
There's another door?

539
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,600
Right.

540
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,200
Why didn't you tell me?

541
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,120
Didn't I tell you it's useless?

542
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,640
What to do?

543
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,040
We're not really locked here, are we?

544
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,000
It's locked from the outside.

545
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
I don't want to spend the night here.

546
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,440
Can you stop walking around?

547
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,800
It's annoying.

548
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm thinking a way out.

549
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,600
Where's my phone?

550
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,600
- I've already made the call. - You...

551
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,720
Forget it. I have to go.

552
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,080
I'll do my business.

553
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,560
Why didn't you leave early?

554
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,080
Can't you see? I'm working.

555
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,720
You don't need to fawn on them for the project.

556
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,960
I didn't.

557
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,640
You did

558
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
because you don't say no

559
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,320
to the thing you don't want to do.

560
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,680
How do you know? Maybe I'm willing to do it.

561
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,960
Willing?

562
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,520
Why did you cry?

563
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,160
I...

564
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,200
It was just yawn.

565
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,560
Why are you being so condescending?

566
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,480
You think everyone got your brain and

567
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,320
can refuse to follow any orders?

568
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,200
Now that we are here,

569
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,560
we represent all the freshmen.

570
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,480
It's fine whatever they ask us to do.

571
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,680
We will be blamed

572
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,640
if we don't do it.

573
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,000
Besides, why can't I do it well?

574
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,040
I just want them to know

575
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
we can't do anything.

576
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,280
You got easily affected by their provocation.

577
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,240
You got the brain too.

578
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,480
How...!

579
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,520
If I were you,

580
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,240
I wouldn't waste my time

581
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,760
on something wrong.

582
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,840
Why do you teach me how to act?

583
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,040
I have my own way.

584
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,560
That's why you're not as good as me.

585
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,760
Yuan Qian, are you in there?

586
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,800
I'm here.

587
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,120
I'm here.

588
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,840
Yuan Qian, are you in there?

589
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
- I'm here. - Yuan Qian.

590
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm here. I'm here.

591
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,400
Step back. Away from the door.

592
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,440
What are you doing?

593
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,320
It's here.

594
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,280
My friend is locked in here.

595
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,560
It's public property.

596
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,040
Don't worry. I'll open it.

597
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,080
Wait a moment.

598
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,280
- Here. - Thank you.

599
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,000
Song Siyi.

600
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,480
Why are you here?

601
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,880
You didn't reply to my messages all day.

602
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,160
And I can't get through to your phone.

603
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,160
I have to wait for you at your dorm.

604
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,640
My phone...

605
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,600
Look.

606
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,680
I've saved you again.

607
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,000
If they all count,

608
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,240
you should've married to me twice.

609
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,360
Even if I should, it will be the security guy.

610
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,120
He opened the door. Not you.

611
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,040
Don't let him suffer again.

612
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Let me suffer for him.

613
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,600
Why are you so mushy now?

614
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,200
I can't get used to it.

615
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,960
Qin Shen, are you okay?

616
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Don't look at other boys.

617
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,920
Well.

618
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,480
Why are you pulling my hair?

619
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,360
Why were you locked up with him?

620
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,960
Coincidence.

621
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,520
Do you think I want that?

622
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,160
Why are you so late?

623
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,520
The project is that tiring?

624
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Ask Chen Qinan.

625
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,520
Chen Qinan?

626
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,280
What about him?

627
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,280
Jut keep doing your thing.

628
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,440
Qin.

629
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,480
I was shocked by those in my club,

630
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
When we first came here,

631
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,000
everyone was single.

632
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,280
Why am I the only one

633
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,880
who stays alone now?

634
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,680
Looking at those couples,

635
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,040
I feel so terrible.

636
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,720
Well.

637
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,400
The pillow feels so soft.

638
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,360
What will it feel like

639
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,920
to hug a girl

640
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,480
who is cute and smells good?

641
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,080
Nothing special.

642
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,080
Who did you hug? Why do you say that?

643
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,760
Who could he hug?

644
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,680
He can only hug himself like this.

645
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,360
Tell me. Who did you hug?

646
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,720
Get away.

647
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,000
Did you tell Ling Wei about my being locked?

648
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,160
I have to water the flowers.

649
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,200
Did you hug Ling Wei?

650
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,720
Don't say that.

651
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,720
Don't say that.

652
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,240
He will kill me.

653
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,880
It wasn't Ling Wei.

654
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,960
You are all mean to me.

655
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,120
We are not.

656
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,920
Only the computer is loyal to me.

657
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
Lights out.

658
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,320
Xuexue.

659
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
Willing?

660
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,040
Why did you cry then?

661
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,720
Don't waste your time.

662
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,640
You're talking to me?

663
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,600
Aren't you here to say thank you?

664
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,880
Well.

665
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
What're you doing?

666
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,160
Don't stand in the way.

667
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
It's scary.

668
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,920
If you hadn't drawn me away,

669
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,560
I would be scratched by the wire.

670
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,480
So,

671
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,840
stay away.

672
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,920
Sorry.

673
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,120
It's okay.

674
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,480
It didn't touch me.

675
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,480
Your work is good.

676
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,400
Pretty good.

677
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,280
Xiangnan.

678
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,080
Qin Shen.

679
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,760
Can you carry them for me?

680
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,600
Whose are they?

681
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,560
Chen Qinan and Yi Ming.

682
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,440
They were called away

683
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,840
by Prof. Jin after getting the water.

684
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,200
They asked me to carry them to the classroom.

685
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,160
Let them do it themselves.

686
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,360
That's what I thought.

687
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,640
But I've waited for half an hour and no one comes back.

688
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,120
I can't just leave the buckets here.

689
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,680
If the buckets are lost,

690
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,080
let them buy new ones.

691
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
But I promised them.

692
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,560
Well.

693
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,400
I'll make two trips. Can you keep an eye on them?

694
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,800
Wait.

695
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,520
You're hurt?

696
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,360
Is it the wire in the sculpture

697
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,040
studio?

698
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,080
No.

699
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,480
You are hurt!

700
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,160
Why did you deny it?

701
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,280
That wire is a bit sharp.

702
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,840
And I got a little scratch.

703
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,560
Come with me.

704
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,600
The wound is so deep.

705
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,680
It must hurt.

706
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,840
To thank you for saving me,

707
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,280
I'll treat you to dinner.

708
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,120
It doesn't matter if you don't have the time.

709
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,840
It's your call.

710
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,280
Take the salve.

711
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,920
Remember to apply it.

712
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,240
What time?

713
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,760
I said what time?

714
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,160
Well.

715
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,800
See you at seven.
