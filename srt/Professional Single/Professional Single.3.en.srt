1
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,920
Episode 3

3
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,400
Are they yours?

4
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
I don't think so.

5
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,480
They're not your size.

6
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,440
My feet are bigger, and I don't wear this kind.

7
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,800
Then they must belong to that beauty.

8
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,400
You know her.

9
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Why don't you give them to her?

10
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,480
You've kept me here. Can I do it?

11
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,560
All right.

12
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,560
I've wronged you.

13
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,560
I'll do it.

14
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,920
You done cleaning up?

15
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,080
No.

16
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,960
Qin Shen.

17
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
Come to pay for the ball?

18
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,720
Yuan Qian, Song Siyi won't admit it.

19
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
I need you!

20
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,960
Song Siyi, it's fine you ripped me off.

21
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,880
How could you deny

22
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,920
the thing between us?

23
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,960
Focus on the money.

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,880
I wasn't dating online with you.

25
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,120
I know

26
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,960
we're not going out officially.

27
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,440
But flirting is also precious.

28
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,320
How could you deny it?

29
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,120
Luo Xinxin, stop it. I'll ask him.

30
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,240
Where did you get this jacket?

31
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Explain it.

32
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,160
It was an unwanted jacket of Cheng Hao.

33
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Cheng Hao?

34
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,720
Cheng Hao bought it

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,040
but didn't want it anymore.

36
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
I tried it on since it's not torn,

37
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,360
and it fitted me well,

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
so he gave it to me.

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,560
What about your game account?

40
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,720
I did register the account,

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,920
but I didn't play it often.

42
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,040
And I'd never flirt with someone in it.

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm a solo player.

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,200
Maybe it wasn't him?

45
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,480
Your account was hacked?

46
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
Xinxin,

47
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
cheer up.

48
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm a bit upset

49
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,560
to know it wasn't Song Siyi.

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,920
You're truly a face-judger.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,200
If I work harder,

52
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,960
I may win his heart back.

53
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,240
You'd better try to get back

54
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,640
the money you've lost!

55
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,040
Qin Shen.

56
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Excuse me, may I come in for a while?

57
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes, of course you can!

58
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Qin Shen.

59
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,760
This's the sculpture classroom.

60
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,320
I know, I just want to know

61
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,720
have you seen my dance shoes

62
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,200
in the equipment room?

63
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,600
I don't have them.

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Fine.

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,560
Never mind.

66
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
I'll buy a new pair.

67
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
They're here.

68
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,160
I've found them there.

69
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,640
Thank you.

70
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,080
I was going to give them to you.

71
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
But I didn't know your class,

72
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,720
nor your dormitory room.

73
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,840
I was wondering what to do.

74
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,480
You came here just in time.

75
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
I should introduce myself.

76
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm Ling Wei

77
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,160
from the Dance Department.

78
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
My room is 303.

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,160
You can see me in dance classroom or my room.

80
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,760
Nice to see you, I'm Yuan Qian.

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Sculpture Department.

82
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,080
You've done your homework?

83
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,400
Can't you see I'm handing the shoes back?

84
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,560
Thank you so much, Yuan Qian.

85
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,640
So, Qin Shen.

86
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,440
I'll be off. See you.

87
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,720
I didn't expect

88
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,040
you would come to see me yourself.

89
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,440
I've wronged you after all.

90
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,600
I feel sorry for it.

91
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,120
Make way!

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,760
Look out!

93
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll walk on this side.

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm sorry for Luo Xinxin's matter.

95
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
I thought you cheated on her

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,920
and ripped her off.

97
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,800
It's a little hurt that you thought me that way.

98
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
I have this innocent look after all.

99
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry!

100
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,600
I mean it.

101
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
I was joking.

102
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,320
Never mind.

103
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm so sorry.

104
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,520
I've reflected on

105
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,960
this matter.

106
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
Maybe I had a bias against you,

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,440
but I won't from now on.

108
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Let's be friends officially.

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,520
What's your plan now?

110
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,280
I must find evidence of Cheng Hao's swindling

111
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,160
and get the money back for Luo Xinxin!

112
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,360
And

113
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
I'll fight each one

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
who dares to bully my friend.

115
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,200
I'll fight each one

116
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,960
who dares to bully my friend.

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,160
Cheng Hao, I heard you've hooked up with a beauty.

118
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,320
She's a beauty on photos,

119
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,720
but the real one's horrible.

120
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,680
To think I've played vainly with her in the game

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,960
for two months!

122
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,880
You're so exaggerating.

123
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
The difference between she and her photos

124
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
is ten times as more as you and your photos.

125
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,480
Was I exaggerating?

126
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,480
Well!

127
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,920
Don't think I'll give you cheat sheets

128
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,800
this semester!

129
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,800
You can wait for your dad's punishments!

130
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,560
Do... Don't do that!

131
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll be a dead man

132
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,960
if I can't get my diploma!

133
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,320
I'd fail all the exams the last semester

134
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,720
without your sheets.

135
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Sang Yu, you are the prettiest

136
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,760
and most attractive.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
This's illegal.

138
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
Crap. Will it still work?

139
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,960
It should be water-proof!

140
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,800
All for nothing.

141
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,840
Why were you being so sneaky?

142
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,920
Did you want to scare me to death?

143
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
You're scared because you feel guilty.

144
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,520
What're you doing here?

145
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
Eat.

146
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,480
When did you come?

147
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,840
Before your started recording.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,560
I...

149
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,400
I didn't have a choice.

150
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,880
Drastic times call for drastic measures.

151
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
That's the last time.

152
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,400
It's a deal, then.

153
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,240
It seems you don't have much break

154
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,320
in between each relationship.

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,680
If they know each other,

156
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,600
will they...

157
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,520
It's non of your business.

158
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
Are you nuts?

159
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,280
You really think

160
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,640
you can threaten me with this?

161
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,400
You can change another university

162
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,120
if you are kicked out of here.

163
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,240
I've never heard anyone has been kicked out

164
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,520
for dating too many girls.

165
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,920
How about cheating?

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,200
"Regulation of Student Management in Colleges"

167
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,240
states that

168
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,480
those cheat in examinations, using telecom equipment

169
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,640
or other devices, will be expelled.

170
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,560
You and your playmate have done that together,

171
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,760
and you may

172
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,240
be expelled together.

173
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,360
What're you talking about? I don't get it.

174
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,280
You don't get it?

175
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
Don't think I'll give you

176
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,400
cheat sheets this semester!

177
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,480
You can wait for your dad's punishments!

178
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
Do... Don't do that!

179
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,080
I'll be a dead man

180
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
if I can't get my diploma!

181
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,040
I'd fail all the exams the last semester...

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,080
All of your talk are in there.

183
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,040
Can those jokes be used as evidence?

184
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
You have the same major,

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,600
same class and same examination room.

186
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,280
Your examination serial numbers were close,

187
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,880
which means you sit close.

188
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,920
That provides a suitable environment for cheating.

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,720
And that will be confirmed

190
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,760
by comparing your examination papers.

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,320
Like you're making the call!

192
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,760
Shall we bet on it?

193
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll report this myself.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,040
Let's see whether your papers

195
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,360
will be reviewed.

196
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,320
Give me the phone!

197
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,280
Give me the phone!

198
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,200
Go away!

199
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Robbing and having a fight are legal issues.

200
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,800
According to the Regulation,

201
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,440
you'll be expelled for breaking the law.

202
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,520
You want to drop out earlier?

203
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,200
What the hell do you want?

204
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,360
Apology.

205
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,480
Apologize to Luo Xinxin face-to-face and online.

206
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,720
That's impossible.

207
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,960
Then let's wait for the school's notice.

208
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,800
You'll have one day.

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,840
If you don't do anything in one day,

210
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,840
I'll email this video and my report

211
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,440
to your school.

212
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,240
Think it over.

213
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,120
Thank you.

214
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,920
Don't be.

215
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,480
You've disturbed my dinner.

216
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,840
I still want to thank you.

217
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,320
Are you always that reckless?

218
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,960
What do you mean?

219
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,960
That guy's a jock.

220
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,520
And you?

221
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,760
But it turned out he dared not to do anything.

222
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,240
He chickened out when you showed up.

223
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,280
How do you know they sit close?

224
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
I don't.

225
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,640
I tricked him.

226
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,280
They're of the same class,

227
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,400
and they couldn't sit too far since they could cheat.

228
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,680
And I made up the rest.

229
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,480
It's all on the internet.

230
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,840
And Cheng Hao wouldn't take the chance.

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,800
He's afraid of his father.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,840
You do have some brains.

233
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm kind of intelligent, OK?

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,040
I waited him in the library

235
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,920
to know his schedule

236
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,720
and his dates.

237
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,280
His social media account tells me all.

238
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,600
I planned to follow him and

239
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,480
catch him cheating on his girlfriends.

240
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,360
However, he gave me

241
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,560
a big surprise.

242
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
Look out!

243
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,640
You do have the brain

244
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,560
rather than brawn.

245
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,840
Everyone, listen up.

246
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,720
There is one month left

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,040
till the next anniversary of the university.

248
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,840
There is a gala every year

249
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,720
and it's the 90th anniversary this year.

250
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,600
So there's gonna be a huge event.

251
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,560
All the departments have to be on the show

252
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
and we are the only class in our department.

253
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,720
That's clear that

254
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,680
some of us have to prepare for it.

255
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,640
I think it not only

256
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,560
should be impressive,

257
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,560
but also have

258
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,880
the characteristics and spirits

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,080
of our department.

260
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm thinking

261
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,680
an excellent show may need more funding.

262
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Maybe each of us can

263
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,640
donate 500 yuan,

264
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,560
what do you say?

265
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,280
I'm poor.

266
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm OK with that.

267
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,120
- Me too. - Me too.

268
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,880
All right,

269
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,440
I'll leave this matter

270
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,400
to Yuan Qian.

271
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,640
You and Lu Jianing live in the same room,

272
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,640
and I'll rehearse with her.

273
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,000
It'll be easier for you communicate.

274
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,200
So please give the money to me ASAP.

275
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
You can transfer it online or give me the cash.

276
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
Thank you.

277
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,160
Thank you

278
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,480
for your cooperation.

279
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,600
I hate Yi Ming.

280
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,160
He's such a trouble maker!

281
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,080
Don't cocoon yourself, all right?

282
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,080
You're also a member of the class.

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,040
Xinxin, how's that thing about Cheng Hao?

284
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,960
He has apologized

285
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
and given my money back.

286
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
So my scolding worked.

287
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
You can never be nice to a man like him.

288
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,120
They all paid?

289
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,360
Almost,

290
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,640
except for Qin Shen.

291
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,040
Remind him to do it.

292
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
I'm not sure.

293
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,440
What's the big deal?

294
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,720
He may just forget it.

295
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,600
You're right.

296
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,960
Well,

297
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,560
when can you transfer me the money?

298
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,240
I've got all of them except for yours.

299
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,000
I only have cash.

300
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,880
Can you come to take it?

301
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm at the basketball court.

302
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,840
OK.

303
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,040
What did he say?

304
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,960
He told me to take it at the basketball court.

305
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
Can't he transfer it?

306
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,240
He said he had only cash.

307
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
That's an excuse.

308
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,320
No one uses cash now.

309
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,520
Is he

310
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,560
baiting you?

311
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,200
With what?

312
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,520
With love.

313
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,600
Nonsense.

314
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,440
Are you expecting the spring love?

315
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm mourning for the autumn leaves!

316
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,560
He is nice, generally.

317
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
And he treats me special.

318
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,200
But he has more demerits than merits.

319
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,520
He is a annoying perfectionist.

320
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
He may sit straight even on buses

321
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,280
or chew ten times with one bite.

322
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,120
It must be painful to go out with him.

323
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,120
He may also test the pH value

324
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,400
of your spittle

325
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,200
before kissing.

326
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,000
You're clearly hiding something

327
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,160
for that long retort.

328
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,200
Besides,

329
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,560
nothing has happened yet,

330
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,760
and you're thinking about kissing now?

331
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,480
That's not what I meat.

332
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,480
Forget it. That's all.

333
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
I'll go collecting the money.

334
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,080
Nice shot!

335
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
He's weird,

336
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,640
but he's well-built.

337
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,160
Let's take some rest.

338
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,200
Qin Shen,

339
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,480
you are a fierce player today,

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,600
is that because your girlfriend is here?

341
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,160
I 'm always like that.

342
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,360
Well,

343
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,080
I'm not what you said,

344
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,680
and I'm just here to collect the money.

345
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,800
Your girl is cute.

346
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
They mistook our relationship.

347
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,720
You should explain it to them.

348
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,560
She's not my girlfriend.

349
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,720
Understand.

350
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
She's not his girlfriend,

351
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
but she could be mine.

352
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,680
Are you done?

353
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,760
Let's continue.

354
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,160
I heard someone told Yuan Qian he likes her

355
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,400
at the basketball court?

356
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,840
Isn't it normal?

357
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,520
Yuan Qian is pretty.

358
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,800
Guys are surpassing girls in numbers.

359
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Any girl, as long as she's alive,

360
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,160
could has a suitor.

361
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,680
That's not why I was surprised.

362
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm just curious who did it.

363
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,840
Someone in this room

364
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
happened to be there.

365
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,800
You mean Qin?

366
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,160
I'd like to believe he'll tell himself

367
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,160
he likes himself.

368
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,200
It's impossible he'll do that to a girl.

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,720
Maybe it was the guy from the Sports Department?

370
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,160
He has been following Yuan Qian around.

371
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,120
Listen, Qin,

372
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,200
Yuan Qian

373
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,800
will be stolen away if you keep waiting.

374
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,920
What if someone gets her?

375
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,320
What made you think

376
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,400
that I have a thing for her?

377
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,880
So it's an illusion?

378
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
You could have transferred it online,

379
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,960
but you had to called her to the basketball court.

380
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
So you didn't plan it,

381
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,440
you just got nothing else to do.

382
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,760
All I have is cash.

383
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,960
Right. Right.

384
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,560
Qin will never plan anything

385
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,600
to pursuit a girl.

386
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,400
He's not that clever.

387
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,640
We've known him for over a year,

388
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,840
and never has any girl been that close to him.

389
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,560
Your life will be miserable

390
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,560
if I decide to find a girl here.

391
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,040
Get lost!

392
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,520
But I think Yuan Qian is nice actually.

393
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,080
I would've encouraged you to pursuit her

394
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,960
if I knew she's so approachable.

395
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,160
Right.

396
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,320
Tell me,

397
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,160
do I still have a chance

398
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,280
if I challenge that sports guy

399
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,720
one on one?

400
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,720
I think you do.

401
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,880
Me too.

402
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,200
So much for talking.

403
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll be late.

404
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,920
Bye.

405
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,960
Jianing and I will be a little late.

406
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,920
Sign in for us.

407
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,160
It's impossible to do it in Prof Jin's class?

408
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,200
He's on a business trip.

409
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,480
And another teacher will be there,

410
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,440
who doesn't know us.

411
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,840
Just tick for us.

412
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,520
Alright. That's it. Bye.

413
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,640
Well.

414
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,280
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
It's you again?

416
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,600
What's the matter?

417
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
There was a matter,

418
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,520
but there isn't anymore.

419
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,840
Wait. Wait.

420
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm not done with it.

421
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,960
Sir.

422
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,280
Are you marking papers?

423
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,360
Why don't you tick off

424
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,360
the whole semester since you like it?

425
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,480
Besides, do you think I'm a fool?

426
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
I can't even tell who is absent

427
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,920
with just a few people here?

428
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,800
No, sir. I'm a fool!

429
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Please forgive me.

430
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,280
Listen, Yuan Qian.

431
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,200
Signing for the others

432
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,280
is worse than being absent!

433
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,240
Go back to your seat!

434
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,240
Sir, this's the first time.

435
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,160
Go back to your seat!

436
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,960
Why're you sitting here?

437
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,240
Sorry, I came here first.

438
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
Fair enough.

439
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,720
You can change your seat

440
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,840
if you don't want to sit next to me.

441
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,760
No. No.

442
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,120
I just need to go to the toilet.

443
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,160
Not my business.

444
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,360
Didn't you say it's not your business?

445
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,840
This is your business.

446
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,640
Sorry.

447
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,640
You want me to pay you a new one?

448
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,600
No.

449
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,720
I just want you to know that

450
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,960
don't bump against anyone

451
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,440
who is in front of you again.

452
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,360
Thank you.

453
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,280
Go back!

454
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,680
Listen, everybody.

455
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,880
The school has made the decision,

456
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,280
and we won't receive any more students

457
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
learning sculpture, starting this year.

458
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,040
In other words,

459
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,600
you might be the last students

460
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
of the department.

461
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,280
After all,

462
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,800
it's hard for pure art students to get a job.

463
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
And sculpture

464
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,360
is the omega in those byways.

465
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,960
Take our class for an example,

466
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,760
it was I who reassigned you

467
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,760
from the Designing and Oil Painting Departments.

468
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,880
That's why

469
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,080
we should compromise to reality.

470
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,400
No way. Everything is fine.

471
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,520
How can they stop admissions?

472
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,360
What about our future?

473
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,840
I should think for myself.

474
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,720
If they know I planned to to change my major,

475
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,520
they will call me a weathercock

476
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,280
and think I panned to run away.

477
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,760
And Professor

478
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,120
must have had a bad impression on me.

479
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I still need his signature for transference.

480
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,440
The termination of the major is such a proof

481
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,360
of my reputation of a "terminator".

482
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,240
The major won't be there anymore. Don't you understand?

483
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
Will they give up on us?

484
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,760
Maybe I should go back to high school?

485
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,720
What're you talking about?

486
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,520
All right.

487
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,600
I'll teach you until you graduate

488
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,280
no matter what.

489
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,240
Thank you, sir.

490
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,920
Thank you, sir.

491
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,040
OMG!

492
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,760
Qin, what's on your sleeve?

493
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,480
You crafty and dirty boy!

494
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,120
Qin has a girl!

495
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,480
I think

496
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,280
the girl with foundation and lipstick

497
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,480
should've kissed it in this way.

498
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,000
There's only one truth.

499
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,200
According to the shade of lipstick,

500
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,520
she should has the age between 12 and 65.

501
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,240
The height

502
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,200
is about 4' 9".

503
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,160
What're you talking about! Tell us.

504
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,840
Come on,

505
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,680
tell us about her.

506
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,160
Will you wash it for me if I say?

507
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,400
No way, sorry.

508
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,120
Then shut up.

509
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,600
All right, bye.

510
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,320
Come my office. - Pro. Jin.

511
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,200
I think their works

512
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,840
are poor in structures.

513
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,200
Sculpture is

514
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
turning 3D to 3D.

515
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,400
And sketch is 3D to 2D.

516
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,680
So sketching will be helpful for your understanding

517
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
of the body structure.

518
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,760
I've decided to add a sketch class the next week.

519
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,560
All you can do is "Mmm".

520
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,160
You'll find the female model.

521
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,240
Sir?

522
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,160
What?

523
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
Sir, about today's...

524
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,840
Stay away from me. There.

525
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,080
About the signing in,

526
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,360
I'm so sorry.

527
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,400
But I...

528
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,160
But what?

529
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,120
Save your tricks.

530
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,720
Listen,

531
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,080
you're in a big trouble!

532
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,480
You may go.

533
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,960
Don't forget what I've told you.

534
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,080
Can I find a male model?

535
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,840
You've been drawing males a whole semester,

536
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,360
it's time for female.

537
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,040
Should I find one with clothes on or without?

538
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,000
Cut the crap.

539
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,560
Can you know the body structure with clothes on?

540
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,200
Sir, about this matter...

541
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,000
Sir, leave it to me.

542
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,640
It'll be awkward for a boy

543
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,960
to talk this to a female model.

544
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,080
But it'll be convenient for a girl to do it.

545
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,080
Fair enough.

546
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,200
You...

547
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,480
I can do it, sir.

548
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,840
All right.

549
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,680
You two shall

550
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,760
figure it out.

551
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,960
Yes, sir!

552
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,040
OK, it's settled.

553
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,720
Go for it!

554
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,680
Go for it!

555
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,320
Sir, I'm going to find the model.

556
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,480
Do you know when Yi Ming was finding models...

557
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,200
I don't know.

558
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,960
You reap what you sow.

559
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,040
I didn't expect your help.

560
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,600
She won't come either?

561
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,920
But that's all the money we've got.

562
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,640
The price can't be raised.

563
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,040
Could you

564
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,600
make an exception?

565
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,400
It's fine.

566
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,200
So be it.

567
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,120
Thank you.

568
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,000
Wait!

569
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,880
Monitor,

570
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,440
the models you found last semester

571
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,320
were not highly paid.

572
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,200
Where did you find them?

573
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,320
A senior told me.

574
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,880
They asked for lot at the beginning,

575
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,720
but Qin went and everything was dealt with.

576
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,480
He could do that?

577
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Is pretty face that useful?

578
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,880
What're you talking about?

579
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,040
Qin's good at bargaining.

580
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,840
Really? He can bargain?

581
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,920
Tell you what,

582
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,600
he's an expert in it!

583
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,880
Bro, 500 yuan, it can't be lower.

584
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,760
400 yuan.

585
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,880
Let's meet halfway, 450 yuan, OK?

586
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,920
350 yuan.

587
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Done!

588
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,240
They didn't kick him out for that?

589
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,280
That's his presence and his charm!

590
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,560
Why did Prof. Jin use him

591
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,240
instead of me, the monitor?

592
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,920
For the money's sake!

593
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I see.

594
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,720
Where're you going?

595
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,920
To the classroom.

596
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,440
It's in this direction.

597
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
You look like a fool.

598
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,000
Bye, Qin.

599
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,960
Your hands seem a bit dry.

600
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
What's your business?

601
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,480
Need some hand cream?

602
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,280
I'm good, thanks.

603
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,920
It's useful.

604
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,840
The wound won't hurt with it.

605
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
And it's fragrant and smells like peach.

606
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,600
Smell it if you want.

607
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,640
Do you want to try it?

608
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,000
Come on.

609
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,000
Relax,

610
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,080
I won't peddle it to you.

611
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,200
All right.

612
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,120
Take this.

613
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,480
The wound will heal.

614
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,680
Yuan Qian, have you found the model?

615
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,160
Not yet.

616
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,560
How could it be so easy?

617
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,760
I've found some expensive ones,

618
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,320
but we don't have too much money,

619
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,680
and it's impossible to ask more from Prof. Jin.

620
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,840
What shall we do?

621
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,520
He just leaves?

622
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
I was going to ask him to bargain for me!

623
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,320
How could Qin Shen know bargaining?

624
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,520
Yi Ming told me it was Qin Shen

625
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,160
who helped him to bargain.

626
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,480
He was bragging!

627
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,640
Qin Shen was deceived!

628
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,520
They just made do with it,

629
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,120
and cut the price by half to make a quick end.

630
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,840
The insisted on it

631
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,640
not for bargaining itself.

632
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,920
To think they've made it!

633
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,160
Then didn't I send him hand cream for nothing?

634
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,560
You've sent him a hand cream?

635
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
It's useful.

636
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,440
The wound won't hurt with it.

637
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,040
And it's fragrant and smells like peach.

638
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
Smell it if you want.

639
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,640
Relax,

640
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,080
I won't peddle it to you.

641
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,120
I'm kind of intelligent, OK?

642
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,800
I waited him at the library

643
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,680
to know his schedule

644
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,480
and his dates.

645
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,040
His social media account tells me all.

646
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,360
I planned to follow him

647
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,160
and catch him cheating on his girlfriends.

648
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,200
But he gave me

649
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,040
a big surprise.

650
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,960
Look out!

651
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,040
What're you doing?

652
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,080
Looking for the model.

653
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,040
Haven't found one yet?

654
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,800
Why do I smell something like peach?

655
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,240
My nose tells me

656
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,600
the smell comes from you.

657
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,920
You're using this?

658
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,200
My hands are dry now.

659
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,160
I'm embarrassed to buy this stuff.

660
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,560
Qin, give me more.

661
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,720
You're so petty!

662
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,160
Smells good.

663
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
Man, you've changed!

664
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,640
It's affected by the virus.

665
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'd have been affected too.

666
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,880
Go away.

667
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,200
All right.

668
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,680
We'll need the model in two days.

669
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,440
What can I do?

670
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,640
I shouldn't have taken this job

671
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,560
to impress Prof. Jin .

672
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,360
Now I'll go for wool

673
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,240
and come home shorn.

674
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,440
What's this?

675
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,280
Our new model.

676
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,760
You and I will meet her

677
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,080
this afternoon.

678
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,640
Didn't you tell me to do it myself?

679
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,600
Qin Shen,

680
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,080
I have a lecture this afternoon.

681
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,320
You'll go with me to take notes.

682
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,680
I'll meet the model this afternoon.

683
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
Can't you take a rain check?

684
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,680
She's only free this afternoon.

685
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,000
It's fine.

686
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,960
Sir, I can meet her alone.

687
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,480
You should go.

688
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,720
Our teacher's business matters.

689
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,000
I can go myself.

690
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,640
Just do your business.

691
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,840
Hurry.

692
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,720
Qin Shen,

693
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,440
something wrong?

694
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,840
No.

695
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,080
Then why were you absent-minded in my class

696
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,000
and made phone calls?

697
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,240
Were you worrying about Yuan Qian's

698
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,920
meeting with the model alone?

699
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,840
No.

700
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,360
Sir, anything else?

701
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,800
No, just leave.

702
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,880
Thank you, sir.

703
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,360
To think we're waiting for a old lady

704
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,920
on this street.

705
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,280
Unbelievable.

706
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,640
We're short of money,

707
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,000
so we can't afford younger ones.

708
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,680
Isn't this because of you?

709
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,800
Prof. Jin thinks ill of me because of you.

710
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,160
Or I wouldn't have to meet this model

711
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,120
to impress him.

712
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,600
So that's why you're doing this.

713
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,880
Or what?

714
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,120
I have to repair

715
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,600
my damaged reputation in his heart.

716
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,600
So I promised to find the model

717
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,040
and meet the model.

718
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,400
I also fawned on Qin Shen

719
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,360
and even gave him my hand cream.
