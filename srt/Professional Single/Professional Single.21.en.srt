1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 21

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
Explain it to me!

4
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,560
Can't read my eyes?

5
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,160
He's hopeless.

6
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,520
We're done. Luo Xinxin, let's go.

7
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,811
What's wrong with her?

8
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
Maybe she felt hard to coax you happy so she gave up.

9
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,440
She's dishearted these days.

10
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,920
What's up?

11
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,000
Nothing.

12
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,000
Then why're you hiding form me these days?

13
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
I didn't.

14
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
I just felt that

15
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,440
no matter how hard I tried

16
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,680
you just showed me the cold shoulder.

17
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,040
I can't coax you happy anyway,

18
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,080
I shall give up then.

19
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,120
If you wanna break up,

20
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,160
it'll be fine with me.

21
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,080
I didn't say we shall break up.

22
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,000
But you're of the attitude of breaking up.

23
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,920
I've never have a second of that thought.

24
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
You shouldn't think of it, too.

25
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,360
I was a little mad few days ago.

26
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,880
But I'm pacified long before.

27
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,640
Then why you turned a cold shoulder on me?

28
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,000
It's rare that someone's at my service around carefully.

29
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,520
I did enjoyed it.

30
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,680
I knew you're doing it purposely.

31
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you planning to continue such attitude

32
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,640
if I don't give up?

33
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,280
So you were throwing out feelers!

34
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,840
You're getting more guts!

35
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,360
We're in the classroom!

36
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
There's nobody watching anyway.

37
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,800
There're people outside.

38
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
Still mad at me?

39
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Sure.

40
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,600
If only I'm witty,

41
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,400
otherwise I shall still be in your trap!

42
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
Who on earth is in a trap?

43
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,840
You lied first!

44
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
You figured it out?

45
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
Your periods come every end of the month.

46
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,314
But you got underbelly ache in the middle of the month.

47
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,520
I...

48
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,200
I had no choice! You were always ignoring me!

49
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,200
Now we are even.

50
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,720
No one should be angry then.

51
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,085
Seeing that you broke our appointments first,

52
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,320
You should stay and check it here.

53
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,560
Hello? Supervisor.

54
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,840
It's me.

55
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Got it.

56
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,320
Thank you.

57
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,920
What's up?

58
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,697
The supervisor of the Oil Painting Department

59
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
asked me to grab registration files.

60
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,800
You got the files?

61
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,400
You've been waiting so long

62
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,160
for this moment.

63
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
But you seems unhappy.

64
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
It's weird.

65
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I thought I would be happy.

66
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,960
But when I got these files,

67
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,680
I felt it heavy.

68
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,760
Heavy?

69
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,280
Maybe I'm not that eager to transfer

70
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,920
as I imagined.

71
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Is that because of me?

72
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,760
No, not at all.

73
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,960
Maybe it's because I'm in love with here

74
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,400
as I've stayed long.

75
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,960
Maybe you just don't wanna transfer.

76
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,640
I don't know, either.

77
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Then just reconsider it.

78
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,800
There're few more days.

79
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,000
Yuan Qian.

80
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,760
I hope our relationship

81
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
won't affect your decisions.

82
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,480
I wish

83
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,920
you can do what you really love to.

84
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,960
You have my unconditional support

85
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,560
no matter which way you choose.

86
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,480
Okay.

87
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,120
Xinxin.

88
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,680
Cheers, Liu Chengren.

89
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,760
Watch out! Watch out!

90
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Give it back to me!

91
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,440
Hold on!

92
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,520
Hold on! Hold on!

93
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,360
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

94
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,360
Give it to me!

95
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,000
Wait!

96
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,080
Let's say,

97
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,028
you guys can spray me.

98
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,920
Come on, come on.

99
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,720
What did you throw?

100
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,560
Rock.

101
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,160
Rock.

102
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,920
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

103
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,960
Best two out of three.

104
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,080
Spray me! Spray me! Spray me!

105
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,480
Liu Chengren, this one is expired!

106
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,360
Prof. Jin must will scold you if he sees!

107
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,400
What did you say?

108
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Best two out of three.

109
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Yuan Qian.

110
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,440
How's it going?

111
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,760
You've talked to the supervisor

112
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,920
and confirmed your transfer?

113
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,360
Almost.

114
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
The couple of our class

115
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,200
will reduce one as you leave.

116
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,840
Thar's a good news for our singles.

117
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,280
Will you think of me

118
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,600
when having classes

119
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,960
and feel lonely

120
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
after I transferred?

121
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,520
I only concentrate on sculptures

122
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,400
when I'm having classes.

123
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,720
What a insensitive man.

124
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,080
Big news!

125
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,040
There'll be a reform on our department.

126
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,880
From next semester,

127
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,640
our department will be changed

128
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,480
into the direction of sculpture design!

129
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,960
Our classroom will be given to other departments.

130
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
How could it be!

131
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,600
It has been discussed for a year.

132
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,680
No, it's impossible.

133
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,720
Actually the school's for ours' good.

134
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,720
It's not bad to learn computer-aided design.

135
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,280
It's easier to get employed after graduation.

136
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,040
Jia Sicheng, who do you support?

137
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,200
You can transfer if you like it!

138
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,680
Don't speak on behalf of us all!

139
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
I didn't say I'm willing to take these reforms.

140
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,280
Since we can't change it, we might as well take it

141
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
and learn new skills.

142
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,400
Why should we?

143
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,840
We dislike sculpture at first,

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
but the school throw us here.

145
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,777
Now we are finally in love with sculpture.

146
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,160
But they're changing our majors.

147
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,040
We should learn what we originally learnt!

148
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
Yes!

149
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,280
I chose sculpture

150
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,360
to make arts.

151
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,160
Teacher.

152
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,040
Sculpture...

153
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,200
I knew it all.

154
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
Teacher,

155
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,080
could you please apply for the school

156
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,160
to hold back the decision?

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,280
What if we can't recruit students?

158
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,560
At least let us

159
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,640
learn it integrally.

160
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,480
The reforms of the school

161
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,160
is for your employments.

162
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
From now on,

163
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,840
our direction of major

164
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,600
is landscape design

165
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,520
and sculpture design.

166
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
They're all belongs to computer-aided design,

167
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,640
lays more on technologies

168
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,800
and is in accordance with the tide.

169
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,480
The who will make arts if we all do design.

170
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,560
We wanna learn arts,

171
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,960
not design.

172
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,920
I understand your feelings.

173
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,400
But the school

174
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
means good for you.

175
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,480
So, just take as things come.

176
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,800
Teacher...

177
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,640
Stop it. I'll leave this class for your self-study.

178
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,720
Teacher,

179
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,394
the existence of our department bears its own meaning.

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,080
How could he be!

181
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
He just left us along here!

182
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,720
Prof. Jin is tied up with

183
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,080
leading the senior year students.

184
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,240
Don't push him.

185
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,880
It's useless to resist now.

186
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,120
We'd better learn

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,760
what they teach us.

188
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,400
Jia Sicheng, that's enough.

189
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,560
You can't stop seeking attentions!

190
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,840
Can you talk like a homo sapiens?

191
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,720
Jia Sicheng, how could you support our enemy!

192
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
I won't change my major.

193
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,560
Then you tell me

194
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,720
what we should do.

195
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,040
Even Prof. Jin can't help us now.

196
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,720
I'll figure it out.

197
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,480
Go back to your seat

198
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,400
and practise yourself.

199
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
They were too anxious

200
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,680
that they didn't choose right words.

201
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,800
Don't take Jia Sicheng's words on your minds.

202
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,760
What about your transferring?

203
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,480
I think I'll transfer.

204
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Now, sculpture is changing its direction

205
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
and I'm worse on design.

206
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,228
It's better for me to transfer.

207
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,480
What about you?

208
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
You love to make sculptures purely for arts.

209
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,360
Now what will you do

210
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
as it changed into design?

211
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,920
Got a call.

212
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,600
Hello.

213
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,800
Who is it?

214
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,720
You won't even let me hear your phone call?

215
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,320
It's a friend.

216
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,160
It's too noisy here.

217
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm in a hurry

218
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,388
and shall go back to dorm first.

219
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,440
OK.

220
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,520
I think something happened to you theses days.

221
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
What things can happen to me.

222
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll answer the phone.

223
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,320
Work hard, I gotta go.

224
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,440
Go! Go!

225
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,880
Yuan Qian.

226
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,280
Qin Shen said he would against the school

227
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,720
and keep our department.

228
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
What's he going on now?

229
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
He had a plan?

230
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't know.

231
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,960
Then would we

232
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
keep our department?

233
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,400
Will we really have a reform?

234
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,200
I don't know.

235
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,400
What's up?

236
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,000
What's the sigh for?

237
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
He wouldn't let me hear him answering phones.

238
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,600
He even didn't answer my phones.

239
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,280
He's been acting mysteriously.

240
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm wondering if he has an affair.

241
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,942
Otherwise, what should a couple

242
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
hiding from each other?

243
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,240
That's impossible.

244
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,480
If he got others,

245
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,880
you won't be in a relationship.

246
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,640
You're the bug in Qin Shen's life.

247
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,840
Don't be suspicious.

248
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,360
Post pics in Moments isn't enough to show off for you?

249
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,120
You really need to

250
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,600
hurt we singles in dorm?

251
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,280
If this counts showing off,

252
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,497
I'd rather be single all my life.

253
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,520
You two

254
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,960
have strayed from the point too far.

255
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,680
I'm saying the issue of our class.

256
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,560
Could you have a sense of group honor?

257
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,080
I've no emotions in resisting the school.

258
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
I can't even keep an eye on my man,

259
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,080
how can I keep an eye on our department?

260
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,920
How can I lead them

261
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,400
to fight against the school?

262
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,120
I'm a lonely, lousy

263
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,640
and sad girl.

264
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
All I bears in mind is our class.

265
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,920
But all you got on your mind is boyfriend.

266
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,560
Being in love is bad for buseiness.

267
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,040
Stop moping around.

268
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,160
Yuan Qian.

269
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,480
Tell me,

270
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,040
how to tell a friend

271
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,960
her boyfriend is cheated

272
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,640
in a way that won't hurt her?

273
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,000
Yuan Qian.

274
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,560
Hey my mate.

275
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Are you OK, Yuan Qian?

276
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,680
Sorry. Sorry.

277
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,720
It's OK. It's OK.

278
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
You alright?

279
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,840
Absolutely...

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,360
women's sixth sense can be accurate.

281
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,800
The friend of you has already hurted.

282
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,000
What's going on?

283
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,920
What did he say?

284
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
He said he was occupied

285
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
and was with a senior bro all day.

286
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,960
Are we blind? That was a girl.

287
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,360
We shall now

288
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
make the minds clear on the parties involved.

289
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,240
An interview on Ms. Yuan Qian!

290
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,120
What kind of result do you want?

291
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,200
You want them get a tattered reputation?

292
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,760
Or do you want to kick off the third wheel

293
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
and win the dirt bag back?

294
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,600
There'll only be zero time or countless times of having affairs.

295
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,280
I don't understand

296
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,080
how could a insensitive man like Qin Shen have an affair.

297
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
Maybe he's enlightened

298
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,720
after being with Yuan Qian

299
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,280
and loves to fall in love?

300
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,360
Where's my 40-meters' sword? I'll kill you.

301
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,280
Qin Shen's so sick!

302
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,840
Go jogging in every early morning?

303
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,720
I wanna sleep!

304
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,960
Our tracking plan

305
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,120
may die in the bassinet before we carry it out.

306
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
Forget it.

307
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,600
Let's go.

308
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,640
Qin Shen and Yuan Qian

309
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,971
are really a match made in heaven.

310
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,120
Yuan Qian.

311
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,120
I was doing it for you to sacrifice my beauty

312
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,760
to ask Chen Qinan about the private information.

313
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,440
Just let me sleep.

314
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,760
You and Jianing would be sufficient.

315
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,960
I wanna sleep some more.

316
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
Luo Xinxin.

317
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,800
Get up.

318
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,800
Xuexue.

319
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,720
Help me.

320
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,920
What about go on the duty with me?

321
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,777
You can help me maintain the transport at school gate.

322
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,840
That's thrilling! Let's go.

323
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,600
This may not be a proper hide.

324
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,200
Yuan Qian.

325
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,280
You're so well equipped.

326
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,200
I prepared it in the late night yesterday.

327
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Coming! They're coming!

328
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,720
Don't get angry. Don't.

329
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,960
Don't get angry. Don't.

330
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm gonna react.

331
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,640
Qin Shen.

332
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,400
Bro.

333
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,160
I got what you want to know.

334
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,600
Prof. Jin is giving lectures

335
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,400
in many high schools.

336
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,360
He's probably doing it for Sculpture Department.

337
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,720
So, don't worry.

338
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,280
We shall just cooperate with them.

339
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,040
Thanks, tutor.

340
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,520
What tutor.

341
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,960
Qin Shen.

342
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,000
You should hold the morale of your class

343
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,777
and keep the sculpture department.

344
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,160
Another thing that surprised me is that

345
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,800
you went for Huang Ziang.

346
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
I haven't been able to reach you.

347
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
So I could just go for him.

348
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,680
He's nice.

349
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,040
Yes.

350
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,480
Actually, he's been regretted since that issue.

351
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,640
But he might took himself as a senior brother

352
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,840
and thought it may lose face if he apologize.

353
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,160
Just try to understand him.

354
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,240
What?

355
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,200
Qin Shen.

356
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
Although my hair's curl,

357
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,680
I'm quite straight.

358
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,120
Yuan Qian. Yuan Qian.

359
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,920
Stay away from my boy friend!

360
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,880
Bro...

361
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,880
Yuan Qian.

362
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Will you track me again?

363
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,240
No.

364
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,760
Are you still doubt about me?

365
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,600
Nope.

366
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
You know you're wrong?

367
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,240
You do care about me.

368
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,280
Not at all.

369
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,640
I was flushed

370
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,680
by my noble moral.

371
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,520
My world

372
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,120
won't tolerate such a shameful value.

373
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,520
I'm enforcing justice on behalf of Heaven.

374
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh! Lin won't hold the grudge, right?

375
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,960
He went to do his hair

376
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,400
without having a meal.

377
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,560
Go back first. I'll answer a call.

378
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,680
Hello.

379
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,360
I'll take a leave to my hometown

380
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,000
and won't be at school for days.

381
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,560
I'll contact you when I arrived grandma's home.

382
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,440
OK.

383
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,240
Where are you?

384
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,480
In grandma's house.

385
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,680
That's quick.

386
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,782
Three hours' travel on high-speed railway.

387
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,280
Have you had dinner?

388
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,360
Yes, I had it on the train.

389
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,560
Qin Shen?

390
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,280
Qin Shen?

391
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Can you hear me?

392
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,240
You got the bars?

393
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,360
You didn't got the bars just now?

394
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,800
No.

395
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,440
Grandma's beside me just now.

396
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,000
What do you mean by "she's beside you"?

397
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,502
She wanted to have a look at you.

398
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,680
So I just covered the camera an showed her.

399
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,080
What... what?

400
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,520
It happened unexpectedly.

401
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,565
Did you do something weird

402
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
in front of the camera?

403
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,600
I... I'll jump off the dorm!

404
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,480
Believe me or not!

405
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,520
Qin Shen, why don't you inform me first?

406
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,240
What did you do in front of the camera?

407
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
You want to make a fool of me in front of grandma!

408
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,440
You made me a laughing stock twice today.

409
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
They were really smacks in the face!

410
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,680
Bye bye.

411
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
Prof. Jin is late.

412
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,000
Where's him?

413
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,160
He might be tied up.

414
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,240
Prof. Jin asked for a leave.

415
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,840
Practice freely today.

416
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,320
He'll teach us no more, right?

417
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
Don't talk nonsense.

418
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
Prof. Jin was really occupied.

419
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,760
I know.

420
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,000
He's being busy giving lectures.

421
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,320
He's finding another job as we'll be transferred.

422
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
This could be understood.

423
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,480
Prof. Jin is giving lectures?

424
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
In Moments yesterday,

425
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,605
I saw someone posted his video

426
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,360
in Xuanzhou No.1 Middle School.

427
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,240
Prof. Jin won't leave his students alone.

428
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,640
He has his principles.

429
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,040
Before he state us an explanation,

430
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,360
we shall not guess it ourselves.

431
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,240
I just split out what I saw.

432
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,600
I've not other meanings.

433
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,920
He might have his own reasons.

434
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,760
He must have his own reasons.

435
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,320
We should believe in him.

436
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,640
Yes.

437
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,400
Let's mind our own businesses.

438
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,360
OK.

439
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,400
Yuan Qian.

440
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,680
Did Qin answer your phone these days?

441
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,480
Despite of the last time we had a video call

442
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,880
when he's in his grandma's house,

443
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,680
we hadn't reach each other from then on.

444
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,240
Qin's family is always against him on learning sculpture.

445
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,617
To make him drop out of the school,

446
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,057
his mother even cut off his living costs!

447
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,440
He worked so hard on projects and part-time jobs

448
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,800
to learn sculpture well

449
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,680
and prove his mom that

450
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,120
learning sculpture is useful.

451
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,720
But since sculpture department will have a reform,

452
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,080
there shouldn't be any reasons to hold on to it.

453
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,520
Maybe...

454
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,600
he would drop out then.

455
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,800
Impossible.

456
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Qin Shen is a man with sense of responsibilities.

457
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,240
If he planed to do so

458
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,200
or have other ideas,

459
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680
he would have told us.

460
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,840
Sorry.

461
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm just passing by.

462
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,760
Stop thinking about

463
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,080
how to keep our department.

464
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,480
Care more about yourselves.

465
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,560
What's up?

466
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,011
Qin Shen had dropped out of school

467
00:32:30,102 --> 00:32:31,000
seeing there'll be a reform,

468
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,520
He's close with Prof. Jin.

469
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,640
His running away means

470
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,280
the reform is doomed

471
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
no matter how hard we try.

472
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,742
Qin Shen didn't dropped out of school.

473
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,714
Jia Sicheng, don't start rumors!

474
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:40,720
Then tell me where is he.

475
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,120
He asked for a leave for family issues.

476
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,320
What issue needs a leave for so long

477
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,720
without even inform his girlfriend?

478
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,760
Liu Chengren.

479
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,194
Let's go.

480
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,542
Class is not over, where're you going?

481
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
It's useless to stay here.

482
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,862
We have to learn computer-aided design.

483
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,920
Then we'd better start it earlier.

484
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,560
Without Prof. Jin and Qin Shen,

485
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
you won't save sculpture department?

486
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,160
You guys said you will,

487
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,497
but you're not thinking of any plans!

488
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,840
We won't have plans without them, right?

489
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,480
Jia Sicheng.

490
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,400
We still have chances if the day hadn't come.

491
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,640
Don't be disheartened.

492
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,280
You saw how hard I worked on sculptures.

493
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,080
I'm the one with the strongest wishes

494
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,520
of continue to learn sculpture.

495
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
But both Prof. Jin and Qin Shen

496
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,160
had gave up on it.

497
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,160
What can we do?

498
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,800
You got some good ideas?

499
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,040
If you have, I'll listen to you then.

500
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,040
OK.

501
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,000
Jia Sicheng.

502
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,320
Remember what you say.

503
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,400
You'll listen to us.

504
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,800
Only if you can make it.

505
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,600
Fatty, take a seat.

506
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,800
Liu Chengren.

507
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,680
Prof. Jin

508
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,200
is giving lectures in high schools

509
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,040
around the city.

510
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,320
He also gives out books for free.

511
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,840
Don't know what he want form this.

512
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,720
His lectures

513
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,560
are all for free

514
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,120
and were all on sculpture.

515
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,080
It's said that it was for recruiting students.

516
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,680
Maybe he wants to influence more students

517
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,680
to be interested in sculptures.

518
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,548
Actually, he should have done this earlier.

519
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,240
Yes.

520
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,040
Yuan Qian.

521
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,760
Teacher.

522
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
Why're you here?

523
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,680
Teacher.

524
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,480
You haven't showed up on our class for days.

525
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,040
I want to ask you about it.

526
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,680
Recently, I'm on a tight budget.

527
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,600
So I want to grab some side money.

528
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,160
I...

529
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,200
You're doing this for our department.

530
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,280
We're reluctant to leave

531
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,725
thought we've just studied it for a year.

532
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
Let along you.

533
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,920
Reluctance is useless.

534
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,720
We can't recruit enough students for years.

535
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,120
The emplyment rate is relatively low.

536
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,560
So people think Sculpture Department

537
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,160
has no reason to exist.

538
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,120
Then...

539
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,680
why are you giving lectures

540
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,720
around high schools?

541
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
I just can't let it go.

542
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,200
If we can recruit 60 students next year,

543
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,000
we may keep our department.

544
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,120
Then you could just tell us your plan.

545
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,440
I'm just uncertain about the result.

546
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,760
Even if we have 60 students next year,

547
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,360
what about the future recruitment?

548
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,240
OK, gotta go.

549
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,920
I have to rush to another school.

550
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,960
Right.

551
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,560
Don't tell your classmates.

552
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,880
I don't want to give you hope first

553
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,200
and disappoint you then.

554
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,240
Yuan Qian.

555
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,760
Brother.

556
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,040
Why're you here?

557
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,880
I'm here for Prof. Jin.

558
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,040
I can't believe

559
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
he would really let us go.

560
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,960
He won't.

561
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,200
He's been giving lectures around

562
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,640
for the recruitment.

563
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Qin Shen knew it. Didn't he tell you?

564
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Qin Shen.

565
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,840
He's occupied

566
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,120
and is not at school.

567
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,920
Alright.

568
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,640
Gotta go.

569
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,680
You're doing this for our department.

570
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,800
Then you could just tell us your plan.

571
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't want to give you hope first

572
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,560
and disappoint you then.

573
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,880
I saw Prof. Jin at Xuanzhou Middle School.

574
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,240
He's giving lectures.

575
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,320
But they are all for free.

576
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,240
I've talked to him.

577
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,560
He didn't abandoned us.

578
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,480
He was doing it to keep our department.

579
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,800
What do you mean?

580
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
He had dealed with the school leaders that

581
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,200
if we can recruit 60 students next year

582
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,720
our department can keep its direction purely for art.

583
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,160
There shall be a meeting

584
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,800
in our classroom at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

585
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,400
We shall discuss how to help Prof. Jin,

586
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,360
or let's say,

587
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,680
to help ourselves.

588
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,120
Really?

589
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,280
Yuan Qian, you're transferring.

590
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,120
Why are you eager to

591
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,560
stand for Prof. Jin?

592
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,640
As long as I'm in our department,

593
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,080
I am a member of you.

594
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,680
If your affections for sculpture

595
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,960
won't compete one who's gonna transfer,

596
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
I have nothing to say.

597
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,560
Yuan Qian.

598
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,160
Shall we really go in there?

599
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,760
Yes.

600
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,760
There shouldn't be only the four of us.

601
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,560
Two heads are better than one.

602
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,960
Not to mention that we have four.

603
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,960
It won't affect us if they aren't here.

604
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,120
It's OK.

605
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,600
Girls can do this.

606
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,160
I believe we can.

607
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,800
March on!

608
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,640
March on!

609
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,200
Qin Shen.

610
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,240
Qin.

611
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,400
Qin.

612
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,000
Piss off.

613
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,520
Where did you go?

614
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,040
Yes! Yes!

615
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,480
You're leaving our department along.

616
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,240
Why are you here?

617
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
I want to learn sculpture.

618
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,760
I thought you abandoned us.

619
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,720
I believe you've read my messages.

620
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm wondering

621
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
if you have any suggestions?

622
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,800
I have.

623
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,920
I think we can spread leaflets

624
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,520
at high schools.

625
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,640
And we can let students know

626
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,760
how great our major is.

627
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,680
Naive.

628
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,480
Spreading leaflets' out of dates.

629
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,760
We can learn from Prof. Jin to teach for free

630
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,280
in art training schools for College Entrance Examination.

631
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,520
We can teach basic skill classes

632
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,160
and encourage students in the name of a teacher

633
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,400
to enter Sculpture Department of Xuanzhou University.

634
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,960
The leaders of the schools aren't blind.

635
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,480
They dare not to let you harm the younger generation.

636
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Yes.

637
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,400
Reflect on your own level.

638
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,200
The pot calling the kettle black.

639
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,000
We're the same.

640
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,840
Chen Qinan.

641
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,800
You knew how lousy your idea was!

642
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,400
Actually the basic of having recruitment

643
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,640
is to extend our influences.

644
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,280
My suggestion is

645
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,160
we can try the competition of Sculpt the City.

646
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,240
Sculpt the City?

647
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,520
That's a good idea.

648
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,040
A national competition?

649
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,200
That's great.

650
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,720
If we win it,

651
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,880
we can spread

652
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
the fame of our department soon.

653
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,920
That's a good idea.

654
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,680
I'm on it!

655
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,440
- Me too. - I agree.

656
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm sure on it.

657
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,960
- Don't touch me. - I'm on it.

658
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,600
The sculpture for the city

659
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,440
should be in accordance with its culture.

660
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,760
I'll take you to museum tomorrow

661
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,280
and get some spirits.

662
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,240
OK.

663
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,960
Museum.

664
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Thank you, sir.

665
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,280
Goodbye, teacher.

666
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,360
Goodbye, teacher.

667
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,880
Qin, shall we enroll to you

668
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:25,977
the list of going to the museum?

669
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,880
- I'll go! - I'll go!

670
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,040
The task falls on you.

671
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,240
He's leaving?

672
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,200
Then I'll take it.

673
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,800
Here you are.

674
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,240
What?

675
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,040
I'm back.

676
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,280
Welcome back.

677
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,480
What's wrong?

678
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
You ask me what's wrong?

679
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,080
You've disappeared for days

680
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,200
and you're asking me what's wrong?

681
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,240
You should ask yourself what's wrong.

682
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,200
So,

683
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,240
where did you go?

684
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,920
What were you doing?

685
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,880
You can organize your logic first.

686
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,240
