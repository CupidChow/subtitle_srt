1
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,920
Episode 2

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
At that moment,

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
no rumors can be believed anymore.

5
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,080
Because at the end of the corridor,

6
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,440
there was no compartment at all.

7
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,520
That was a door,

8
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,720
a door connecting the male and female bathhouse.

9
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
Lecher!

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,000
You freak!

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,480
There seems to have man's voice.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,640
How could there have man's voice?

13
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,320
Is that an illusion?

14
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,280
Why are you shouting?

15
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,880
I forgot to bring my facial cleanser.

16
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,920
Can I use yours?

17
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,280
Okay.

18
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
It's over there. Take it yourself.

19
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,400
Okay.

20
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,440
Boys in our department

21
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
are not good at basketball.

22
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,680
We really need your help.

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm OK with that.

24
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,960
He will make the call.

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,360
OK.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,320
You can make any request for it.

27
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
We will buy you gifts,

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,080
or is there anything you want?

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,280
No, we just need one gift.

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Tell me.

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
Just cheer for us.

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,480
The boys from sports department

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
are so generous.

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,600
See you then.

35
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,240
Bye-bye.

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,920
You are good, man.

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,240
You can avail yourself of every opportunity.

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:36,960
What're you talking about?

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,040
Let's go.

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,360
Wei.

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,160
Have you read the message I sent you?

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
I was too busy today. I forgot it.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,440
What's wrong?

44
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,720
Listen.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,360
When I was taking bath today,

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,800
the girl in front of me

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
dropped her bath towel.

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,080
And then?

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
The bath towel that girl dropped

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,520
was the prize for the MVP

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,920
in the basketball game last year.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,800
It was that of Qin Shen's.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,760
You know.

54
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,440
That was quite personal.

55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,760
Even it's a new one,

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,880
he should only give it to his girlfriend.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
The girl you just talked about,

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
who is she?

59
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,280
I think she is Yuan Qian.

60
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,720
The homophones of their names

61
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,200
are "doomed love".

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,920
And they are always teased for it.

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,840
We have already taken him

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,560
as your boyfriend.

65
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,000
Has she swooped in and gotten him?

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,000
Have you eaten?

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
Don't you always want to eat

68
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,040
the fired meat in the cafeteria?

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,080
You helped me take the package today,

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,400
so I must show my gratitude.

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,200
Really?

72
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,120
The landlord is going to pay. Let's go!

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,840
Let's go.

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
I've swiped it. Thank you.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
Ma'am. The meat. Meat.

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,120
Stop shaking, please.

77
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,360
I must.

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
There are rations.

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,120
Ration it is.

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,920
Ma'am, you are really honest.

81
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,040
Ma'am.

82
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,240
I am still growing.

83
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,840
Thank you.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,640
It's so nice of you.

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,480
This would work?

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,640
Any problem?

87
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,120
No.

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,920
Ling Wei.

89
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,400
Hello, Chen Qinan.

90
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,480
Chen Qinan.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
We are from the same place, OK?

92
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,280
You only said hello to Ling Wei.

93
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,320
Sorry.

94
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,840
My eyes automatically blocked ugly things.

95
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,400
You...

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,920
Qin Shen has found seats.

97
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,680
Do you two want to join us?

98
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
We have finished and are ready to go.

99
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,960
OK.

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,680
Goodbye then, beauty.

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,320
Bye.

102
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,760
It's true.

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,120
If it wasn't for your Qin Shen,

104
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,520
I wouldn't spend my time on Chen Qinan.

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,960
Loyalty gives way to desire.

106
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,600
I can't stand him for a second.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm going to buy the facial cleanser

108
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,080
you said last time.

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,640
I heard that there is a discount if you buy two.

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,200
I'll buy two and give you one.

111
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Really?

112
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,360
Well, I will try to tolerate that guy.

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,760
Do you see the girl behind Qin Shen?

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
Isn't it greasy?

115
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,280
She is the girl with Qin Shen's bath towel

116
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
in the bathroom.

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,160
They are so strange.

118
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,800
She has taken bath towel but they still eat separately.

119
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,600
I guess there is some misunderstanding.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
I think that girl

121
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,080
is not his type.

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
Let me taste yours.

123
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,640
Let' go.

124
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,960
Really.

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,280
It's very delicious.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll never go back when I have to think

127
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,680
before having a meal worth more than 7.5 yuan.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,960
Now, I have to think

129
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,360
before having a meal worth more than 1.5 yuan.

130
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
It sounds familiar.

131
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Little cutie?

132
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,760
It's familiar.

133
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,240
But it's not little cutie.

134
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,520
It's big cutie.

135
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,200
Big cutie?

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,680
Sorry to interrupt.

137
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,560
Get lost!

138
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,200
Right.

139
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
you two went to take a bath, right?

140
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,120
I heard that there was lecher peeping in the male bathroom.

141
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,560
It's true.

142
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
I just ran into it.

143
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Really?

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,200
I would go with you if I had known.

145
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,960
What's wrong, Yuan Qian?

146
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,960
I can sacrifice myself.

147
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
So who was she?

148
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
I don't know who she is.

149
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,640
I didn't see her.

150
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,720
Did you see her?

151
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,640
Not really.

152
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,520
Come on.

153
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,440
I'll go by myself next time.

154
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,480
I didn't get my favorite red bean soy milk.

155
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,520
You have to get up early to get it.

156
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,432
You didn't wake me up.

157
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:15,800
Your package from Xuanzhou University
to Xuanzhou University has been delivered.
Received by Qin Shen.
Details about the package:
the sender (Yuan Qian) the receiver (Qin Shen).
If you have any question, please.....
You didn't wake me up.

158
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,870
Your package from Xuanzhou University
to Xuanzhou University has been delivered.
Received by Qin Shen.
Details about the package:
the sender (Yuan Qian) the receiver (Qin Shen).
If you have any question, please.....

159
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,480
Why did I leave my name?

160
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,480
Isn't this almost a confession?

161
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,240
Attention. Attention!

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,960
The mixed basketball game

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
is coming.

164
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,480
There'll be two men and three women in each team.

165
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
To encourage girls to exercise,

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,840
boys' goals are not counted.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Only girls' goals take scores.

168
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
So girls,

169
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,520
you,

170
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,560
be sure to sign up enthusiastically for the class,

171
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
okay?

172
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,280
Not interested.

173
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm talking to you.

174
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,280
Just three girls.

175
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
I don't care. You can sign up yourself.

176
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,960
You must give me the list tonight.

177
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,560
Xinxin.

178
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,560
Actually,

179
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,600
I always think that a girl like you

180
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,560
has always been the wisest and most representative

181
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,040
in our class.

182
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,920
So, can you...?

183
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
According to my prediction,

184
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,960
I will be in my period that day.

185
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,960
I haven't said which day it is.

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
You don't have a girlfriend.

187
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,840
So you don't know about girls like us.

188
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,480
Girls like us

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,120
have a period once a month.

190
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,640
And look at my small physique.

191
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,720
How can I stand

192
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
violent activities like basketball?

193
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
Let me through, please.

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
Let me, the weak girl, to have some water.

195
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,840
- Xue... - Xinxin.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
I want water too.

197
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,800
Here.

198
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,480
- Yuan Qian. - No.

199
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,040
It's too heavy.

200
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,640
Yi Ming sent a red envelope.

201
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,184
Yuan Qian

202
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:46,664
Luo Xinxin
Yuan Qian

203
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:46,840
Xue Congyang
Luo Xinxin
Yuan Qian

204
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,200
Alright.

205
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
The one got the most

206
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,000
are Yuan Qian, Luo Xinxin, and Xue Congyang.

207
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,200
You got in.

208
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,880
Congratulations!

209
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,320
Why is there always me?

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,760
Yi Ming, are you targeting us?

211
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,960
Why our room take up all the places?

212
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,680
I don't care.

213
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
I have sent it to the counselor.

214
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,280
We will confront Dance Department

215
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,080
according to the result of drawing lots.

216
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,040
They've found help from the Sports Department.

217
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,040
And we should take it seriously too.

218
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,000
For this time,

219
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,680
Qin Shen and I will lead the team

220
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
to the victory.

221
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,360
Qin Shen.

222
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
I will send you the training schedule.

223
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,040
Is it serious?

224
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,120
No wonder there is a "MVP" on his bath towel.

225
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,440
They look enthusiastic.

226
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,000
So they have found out

227
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,200
the attractiveness inside of me?

228
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
It is warmer now.

229
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,960
You don't need the thick skin to keep warm.

230
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,840
Good evening, everyone.

231
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,200
Good evening.

232
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
Good evening.

233
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,800
Are all here?

234
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,440
Yuan Qian can't come.

235
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,240
She is busy

236
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
and has no time for basketball.

237
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,920
I like basketball,

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,680
so I'll play for her.

239
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,240
Relax. It will fine.

240
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,000
Come on.

241
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Why is she busy at the start of the semester?

242
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,560
She's a girl.

243
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,440
She must be busy with finding herself "the one".

244
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,480
Maybe

245
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,440
she's fallen in love with some guy in the library.

246
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
Anything else?

247
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,000
Call her now.

248
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,920
Now.

249
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,440
I'll be off then.

250
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,320
Qin Shen

251
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
is too stubborn.

252
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,960
Bye.

253
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Can't you see what others wear?

254
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,640
I only had 15 minutes,

255
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,480
and I ran here.

256
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,040
You deserve it for running from training and competition.

257
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't forget it.

258
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,920
Qin Shen.

259
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,280
I have something say.

260
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,840
I didn't run away. It's just an exchange.

261
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,360
Cut the crap.

262
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,120
Get started.

263
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Don't you come?

264
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,240
We are definitely incompatible.

265
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,680
You.

266
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,040
Come here.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,240
Go practice with Yi Ming.

268
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,520
See?

269
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,720
See what?

270
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,040
How human pass the ball.

271
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,920
Your physique is not as good as Luo Xinxin's.

272
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
So you can't do pick and roll.

273
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,880
You are not as flexible as Xue Congyang.

274
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,440
So you can't be the guard.

275
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,400
They don't need much time for practicing.

276
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,480
What about you?

277
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,120
Bounce the ball.

278
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,880
Isn't he too strict on her?

279
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,640
Look.

280
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,760
Qin.

281
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,680
Is it a little too harsh on girls?

282
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,600
Stop practicing.

283
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,360
It won't work anyway.

284
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
Who are you talking about?

285
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,040
I must do it since you forbid it.

286
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,640
Let's go on.

287
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,320
Looking at them

288
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,120
separately,

289
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,760
they may be single forever.

290
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,120
But if you put them together,

291
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,640
they are a perfect match.

292
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
By the way, Wei.

293
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,480
I heard that Yuan Qian

294
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,000
will play with Qin Shen,

295
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,280
and Qin Shen trains her alone every day.

296
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
They are classmates.

297
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,960
Of course, they will train together.

298
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,640
No.

299
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,040
They can train together.

300
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,240
But there is no need to train her alone.

301
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,800
Maybe she is not good at it.

302
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,520
Anyway, I think Qin Shen is serious this time.

303
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
He is always serious.

304
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Monitor.

305
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Why do we leave later and later every day?

306
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,400
Look at Yangyang.

307
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,080
She is tiny and skinny.

308
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,040
And she still need to grow.

309
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,320
How can she have the time to sleep

310
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,160
if she goes back late every day.

311
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,680
Right?

312
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,680
In fact,

313
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,560
I'm OK with it.

314
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,440
We just

315
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,160
couldn't make the appointment for today.

316
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,760
Luo Xinxin, why are you so difficult?

317
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,880
Look at Yuan Qian.

318
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
She never complained.

319
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,320
She?

320
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,800
She's broken for the practice.

321
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,960
No way.

322
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,760
Sorry. Sorry.

323
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,480
I wasn't paying attention.

324
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,320
It's an accident.

325
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
Yuan Qian, your clothes are soaked.

326
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,320
Qin, you're such a gentleman.

327
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,440
I'll go clean myself up.

328
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,560
Wei, let's go.

329
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Come on.

330
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,440
Keep going. Keep going.

331
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,240
No way.

332
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,080
Maybe he's not that annoying.

333
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,560
Am I having the Stockholm Syndrome

334
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,000
because of the cruelty?

335
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
He was always so mean.

336
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
And I'm moved by

337
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,520
his sudden humane behaviors?

338
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,240
No. No. No.

339
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,800
For my mental heath,

340
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,680
I should stay away from

341
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,320
the terrifying perfectionist.

342
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
3 minutes before the game starts.

343
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,880
Thank you.

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Yuan Qian, come.

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,400
Come here.

346
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,360
Do you know what to do?

347
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,640
Try my best.

348
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
You only need to do one thing.

349
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,960
What is it?

350
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,240
Stand quietly.

351
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,920
If not for the rules of

352
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,280
having 3 girls in each team,

353
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,440
you will have no chance to play.

354
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,320
I get it.

355
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
We will make it, right?

356
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,200
Right. Come on.

357
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,760
Qin, come here.

358
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,360
Yuan Qian.

359
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,520
Come here.

360
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,800
Come here.

361
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,240
Sculpture Department!

362
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,440
We will make it!

363
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,000
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

364
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,880
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

365
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,520
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

366
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
Great!

367
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,040
Go! Go! Go!

368
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Go!

369
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,720
Back on defense!

370
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Back on defense!

371
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,880
Yuan Qian!

372
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,560
Back on defense!

373
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,640
Yuan Qian!

374
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,520
Go! What are you waiting?

375
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,040
Give me my bubbles!

376
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,120
No. I won't.

377
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
What're you doing?

378
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
Go! Go! Go!

379
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,280
Go! Go! Go!

380
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,160
Go! Go! Go!

381
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,040
Go! Go! Go!

382
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,920
Go! Go! Go!

383
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

384
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,120
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

385
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,920
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

386
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,320
Go! Go! Go!

387
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,040
Go! Go! Go!

388
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
Basketball is really barbaric.

389
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,760
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

390
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,840
Go! Go! Go!

391
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,960
Yuan Qian, are you okay?

392
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm OK.

393
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,400
You have the accent of Nancheng.

394
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,480
Are you from there?

395
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,120
Yes, I do.

396
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,000
Does it have anything to do with basketball?

397
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
It doesn't.

398
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
It's just my dad is from Nancheng too.

399
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,320
You accent sounds familiar to me.

400
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,080
What a coincidence!

401
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,160
I want a talk.

402
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,080
Qin Shen.

403
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,800
Do you hold anything against me?

404
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,280
Why don't you pass me the ball then?

405
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,480
So?

406
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,920
I have never been a top student,

407
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,560
but I can't stay at the bottom.

408
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,360
Don't you think it's too much

409
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,840
that you don't pass me the ball

410
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
and make fool of me?

411
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
You should pass me the ball at least once.

412
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,600
Okay.

413
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,760
Anything else?

414
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,320
No.

415
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,240
Nothing more.

416
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
The second half begins!

417
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,400
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

418
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

419
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,160
Go! Go! Go!

420
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,360
Go! Go! Go!

421
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,440
Back on defense.

422
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,560
Back on defense.

423
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,360
We have to get this.

424
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,320
Go! Go! Go!

425
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,200
Go! Go! Go!

426
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,920
Go! Go! Go!

427
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,720
Yuan Qian!

428
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
Don't!

429
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,480
I got it!

430
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
I got it! I got it!

431
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,280
It's our hoop.

432
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
Are you crazy?

433
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,480
Yuan Qian!

434
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,240
Are you an undercover sent by them?

435
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

436
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,640
I didn't know about the switch.

437
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,160
Do you want more balls?

438
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,560
No. No.

439
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Go! Go! Go!

440
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,520
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

441
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,600
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

442
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,440
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

443
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,360
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

444
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

445
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,320
Nice! Nice!

446
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
Go! Go! Go!

447
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,320
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

448
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,400
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

449
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,240
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

450
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,160
Dance Department! Go! Go! Go!

451
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,320
Go! Go! Go!

452
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,880
Sculpture Department! Go! Go! Go!

453
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,360
Win by 2 points. Game over!

454
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,640
Sculpture Department is the winner!

455
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,080
Sculpture Department!

456
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,360
Sculpture Department!

457
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,040
Sculpture Department!

458
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,320
Sculpture Department!

459
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,240
Qin! Qin!

460
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,920
Qin! Qin!

461
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,840
Qin! Qin!

462
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,120
Where is Yuan Qian?

463
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,600
She got the key points.

464
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,360
She seemed to go to the bathroom.

465
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,280
She was seriously hit, I think.

466
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,600
She must feel terrible now.

467
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,600
Aren't the girl of my hometown

468
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,680
has something against Yuan Qian?

469
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,720
I saw her and her teammate

470
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,160
kept pushing around her.

471
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,120
It seemed hurt.

472
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:25,920
Right,

473
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,760
she asked me about

474
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,720
you and Yuan Qian before.

475
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,400
Qin Shen.

476
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,560
To be honest,

477
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,560
did you hit on someone in the Dance Department?

478
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,640
Impossible.

479
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,160
Qin doesn't know romance at all.

480
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,720
Even his sculpture won't have a woman shape.

481
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,760
He is more celibate than a monk.

482
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,120
How can he hit on anyone?

483
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,040
But, Qin.

484
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,680
You really won't find a girlfriend

485
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,200
in the university?

486
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,880
Having a girlfriend

487
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,400
won't help with my life.

488
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,920
Having a relationship is also a waste of time.

489
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,720
If a man gets emotional,

490
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,400
he will become weak.

491
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,680
And I don't have any weakness.

492
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,640
Get lost!

493
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,240
They said Qin Shen had never been in love.

494
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,640
Then what's the thing about you two?

495
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,560
Yes, Wei.

496
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,280
What happened to you and Qin Shen?

497
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,600
Why did he treat you like that?

498
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,040
We hit that bitch

499
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,920
because of you.

500
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,240
It's not what you think it is.

501
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,840
Thank you for being so kind to me.

502
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,680
But don't make it about Yuan Qian anymore.

503
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,840
She has nothing to do with it.

504
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,680
But, Wei, what exactly...?

505
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,480
Forget it.

506
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,040
There must be some terrible stuff.

507
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,080
If you don't want to talk about it, just don't.

508
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,280
That's it. Let's go to take a bath!

509
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,320
Let's go.

510
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,520
Song Siyi, we are leaving. Thank you for today.

511
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Take some rest. Bye.

512
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,560
Can you give me a plaster?

513
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,880
I want one, too.

514
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Ling Wei, we'll be off.

515
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,960
Thank you!

516
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,840
You're welcome.

517
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,200
Ling Wei, this is Qin Shen from your class, right?

518
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,240
He is so handsome,

519
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,080
just as I've been told.

520
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
Wei. Let's go.

521
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,280
Chen Qinan, you didn't play.

522
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,480
Why are you excited?

523
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,960
Don't you know?

524
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm the only backup in our class.

525
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,560
Everyone knows he got no chance to play,

526
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,680
and we didn't even order him the jersey.

527
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,120
Backup?

528
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,440
No wonder.

529
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,920
No matter how desperate we are,

530
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,600
the loser won't get any chance.

531
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,640
Loser?

532
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,840
Who are you talking about?

533
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,280
I'm talking about you.

534
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,480
I will subdue you monster!

535
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,120
Don't!

536
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,920
Don't run! What are you afraid of?

537
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,680
I am a loser! I am a loser!

538
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,360
I'll subdue you loser.

539
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,800
Stop chasing me. Stop!

540
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,040
There is a message.

541
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,920
Yuan Qian, here is yours.

542
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:31,360
Mr. Li - Please scan the QR code to join the group chat of Orienteering class every Thursday afternoon.

543
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,240
Great. We have a group chat for PE class.
Mr. Li - Please scan the QR code to join the group chat of Orienteering class every Thursday afternoon.

544
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,360
Great. We have a group chat for PE class.

545
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,520
So there's no way to skip it.

546
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,120
Just go to the class. Why are you such a trouble?

547
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,560
Yuan Qian, you are here, too?

548
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,280
We are all in here. What a coincidence!

549
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,360
Let's work together.

550
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,400
Can't I get away from them?

551
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,480
I have to stay with them even for PE class.

552
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,520
Fall in!

553
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,840
You!

554
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,280
Step forward.

555
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,520
You came back late.

556
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,320
Clean the equipment room for a week.

557
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,440
Sir, don't.

558
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,640
Sir, I'm from the Sports Department.

559
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,280
It's my turn to clean the room.

560
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,680
I can work with her.

561
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,200
All right.

562
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,360
Get started on hurdling.

563
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,160
Let me do it.

564
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,720
Let me do it.

565
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,760
You can do it yourself. I'll be off.

566
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,760
Thank you.

567
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,480
How about it?

568
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,240
That's how the athlete moves.

569
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,000
How can anyone say those words out loud?

570
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,440
When we get old,

571
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,800
won't it be amusing if we talk to

572
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,800
our children about this?

573
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,440
You are quite imaginative.

574
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,120
We have nothing to do with each other.

575
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,480
We don't have it now, but we might have it before.

576
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,840
And we can have it in the future.

577
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,800
We didn't, don't,

578
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,080
and won't have it.

579
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,760
Don't be so sure about it.

580
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,880
What if you are wrong?

581
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,520
Look at my face carefully.

582
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,360
Is there anything special?

583
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,880
Do I look like your childhood sweetheart?

584
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,160
I just have one childhood sweetheart

585
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,880
and he's not that cheeky.

586
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
Did you stop growing anymore

587
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,680
after a certain time when you grew up?

588
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
I think our heights are perfect for couples.

589
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,880
You can do whatever you want with me.

590
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,920
You can sit on my lap and tie the shoes.

591
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,200
I'm finished.

592
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,080
You are taller than me.

593
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,240
So you can clean the upper part.

594
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,600
OK.

595
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,160
You worked so hard.

596
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,880
Do you think you will lose some weight?

597
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,520
I'm not a fool.

598
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,560
My weight is a secret.

599
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,720
You're dead!

600
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,200
- See? You have gained much weight! - Childish!

601
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,120
You've gained much weight.

602
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,440
You...

603
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,200
Come get me!

604
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,440
Come on.

605
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,600
Stop moving.

606
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,120
So...

607
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,320
Sorry.

608
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,160
We are cleaning the room.

609
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,320
Not my business.

610
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm here for the ball.

611
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,440
Come on. Let's grab some food.

612
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,040
No.

613
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
I have quit dinner.

614
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,560
Why?

615
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,040
So that I can surprise him

616
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,520
when I meet him in real life except for online.

617
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,520
Him?

618
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,320
Right.

619
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,840
You're not in the room everyday.

620
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,800
Where did you go?

621
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,240
I was punished to do the cleaning

622
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,680
with Song Siyi for going back late in the PE class.

623
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,680
Song Siyi? Really?

624
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,320
What's wrong?

625
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,720
Why do you look enchanted?

626
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,640
Actually, I am dating Song Siyi online.

627
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,240
How can I say that?

628
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,800
Song Siyi?

629
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,720
It's not technically online dating yet.

630
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
We are still trying to hit on each other.

631
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,960
But It's pretty awesome.

632
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,520
Besides, he is good at the game.

633
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,360
He plays games?

634
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,960
And makes friends online?

635
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,520
I was also surprised.

636
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,440
I found about his identity

637
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
when he added me as a friend online.

638
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,240
Look.

639
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,400
I thought he was kind of cold.

640
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,520
But it turned out it's quite easy to get him.

641
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,280
My plan is

642
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,080
to win him over online,

643
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,440
and make it to the reality.

644
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,960
What do you think?

645
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
I think...

646
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,720
He doesn't seem like the man who will date online.

647
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,960
Was she fooled

648
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,000
by someone using Song Siyi's photo?

649
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,400
I think

650
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,160
it's fine.

651
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,480
So hot.

652
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
You are a little different today.

653
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
What is different?

654
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,760
You keep looking at me today.

655
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,520
Well, Song Siyi.

656
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,800
Do you play games?

657
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,760
Occasionally, yes.

658
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,520
Yuan Qian.

659
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,360
What do you want to say?

660
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,840
What kind of game are you playing?

661
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Why? Do you want to play with me?

662
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,440
I just want to know.

663
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,960
This one.

664
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,000
Look.

665
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,320
You can register a account.

666
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,560
And we can play it together.

667
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,480
It's really him.

668
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,920
Song Siyi looks decent.

669
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,400
Cheating girls online?

670
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,160
It can't be.

671
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,080
What happened?

672
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,760
Yuan Qian.

673
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,360
My love ends before

674
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,320
it starts.

675
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,720
You broke up?

676
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,520
Xinxin.

677
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,160
Answer me.

678
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,400
Are you sure that person is Song Siyi?

679
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,080
You don't believe me?

680
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,240
No. No.

681
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,240
I just want to confirm it.

682
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,720
Of course, it's him.

683
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,360
I also saw Song Siyi

684
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,960
wearing the coat I bought for him.

685
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
You bought clothes for him?

686
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,800
I also top up his account a little.

687
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
How much is "a little"?

688
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,560
Not so little.

689
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,440
Luo Xinxin, I'm really speechless now!

690
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,320
Alright. Alright.

691
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,200
Stop crying. I won't say anything.

692
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,920
Let's work it out.

693
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,360
Don't want it?

694
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,960
I do. I do.

695
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,880
There. There.

696
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,440
Shoot.

697
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,840
The basketball borrowed that day broke.

698
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,880
Can you pay for that for me?

699
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,960
I have a class now.

700
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,480
I can't.

701
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,320
You borrowed it.

702
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,600
Mr. Li will ask for you anyway.

703
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,960
Just help me with it, please.

704
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,320
Song Siyi is here.

705
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,320
He comes as usual.

706
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,440
I can't just let it go.

707
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,880
He has to pay for it.

708
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,640
Whether it can soothe my wounded soul,

709
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,200
at least I should get the money back.

710
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,840
Come now then.

711
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,240
He is still here.

712
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,960
But he told me yesterday,

713
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,680
he would go training after 5:30.

714
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,880
Come get me!

715
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,520
Come on!

716
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,800
Stop moving.

717
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,600
You...

718
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,040
Damn.

719
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,880
He probably will go training.

720
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,480
I have to find a way to keep him.

721
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,120
Qin Shen.

722
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,720
We seem to be locked here.

723
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,960
Song Siyi.

724
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,280
Yuan Qian, sorry. I'm late.

725
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,120
Why are you here?

726
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,160
So the one up there...

727
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,320
- What up there? - Crap!

728
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,360
Yuan Qian.

729
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,720
By the way, Qin Shen.

730
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,000
Last night,

731
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
the high school classmates were clamoring for a party.

732
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,360
Did you see it?

733
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,640
No.

734
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Let's go together.

735
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,040
I'll take a taxi and pick you up.

736
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,000
I won't.

737
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,480
Everyone will be there.

738
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,400
And they miss you so much.

739
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,480
I don't have the time.

740
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
It won't be too long.

741
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,040
And it's a weekend.

742
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
Let's go together.

743
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,680
Why is it you?

744
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,800
You...

745
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,440
Did you lock the door?

746
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,080
Well...

747
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,480
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,200
Sorry!

749
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,200
You want to run?

750
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,560
I'm really sorry for what happened just now.

751
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,960
It doesn't matter.

752
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,760
We just had a little chat.

753
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,120
It seems I opened the door too early.

754
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,200
Yuan Qian, stop talking.

755
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,400
Let's move the equipment.

756
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,960
Qin Shen.

757
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,520
Who were you looking for?

758
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,800
Mr. Li.

759
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,440
So it's the PE teacher.

760
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,040
I can wait here with you.

761
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,240
I'm not busy anyway.

762
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,040
No need.

763
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,160
I can wait with you, really.

764
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,560
I'm fine, really.

765
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,520
I said, no need.

766
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,360
Alright.

767
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,760
I'll be off then.

768
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,840
Where is that beauty?

769
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,600
She left.

770
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,520
Don't you guys want to talk...?

771
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,080
No.

772
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,240
Why are you here?

773
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,360
Pay for the basketball.

774
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,600
You can wait Mr. Li here.

775
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,720
I have to go to work.

776
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,240
Where is my rag?

777
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,280
I can use Song Siyi's rag.

778
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:50,880
It's there.

779
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,640
Why is it there?

780
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,240
Song Siyi is so lame.

781
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,480
Tricks me all the time.
