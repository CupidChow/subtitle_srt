1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 24

3
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,840
Liu Chengren.

4
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,040
Everyone is trying to protect the sculpture department.

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
And time is running short.

6
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,120
Can't you let go of your prejudices?

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,280
Right.

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,600
Professor Jin said that it wasn't Qin Shen.

9
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Don't go into a dead end.

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
- What about Jia Sicheng? - Liu Chengren

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,600
Sorry.

12
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,640
I smashed the sculptures.

13
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
It has nothing to do with Qin Shen.

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,960
What?

15
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,680
What did he say?

16
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,600
I smashed all the sculptures.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
I was afraid of being blamed

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,400
and you would give up on me,

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,160
so I didn't admit it.

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,760
Jia Sicheng, what are you talking about?

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
Did you really do it?

22
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,320
Are you mad?!

23
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,600
Sorry, everyone.

24
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,000
I lost control that day.

25
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
When I smashed my own sculpture,

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,960
I accidentally destroyed yours.

27
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm really sorry.

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,920
Qin Shen was wronged because of me.

29
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,440
Sorry.

30
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
And thank you.

31
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,600
No matter the reason,

32
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,760
things have already happened.

33
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,080
Now that we have a better solution,

34
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,040
let's solve the matter first.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Obviously no one meant it.

36
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,760
So should we hurry up

37
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,920
and restore the sculptures now?

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,800
I agree!

39
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,160
We still have time to restore them today.

41
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,840
Sure.

42
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,560
Morning!

43
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,440
Morning!

44
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,760
Morning!

45
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,280
Morning!

46
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,320
Coming!

47
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,640
Morning!

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,480
Morning!

49
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,200
Let's fix here again.

50
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
Xinxin, give me that kettle.

51
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
That one…

52
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,280
The steel wire in the hand

53
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
I made came out. Take a look.

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,600
Pass the kettle over, please.

55
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Here.

56
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,640
Be careful. Don't scratch your hands.

57
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,480
Xinxin, that hand…

58
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
The wire comes out a little.

59
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
- Got it. – Did you see it?

60
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,920
Just right.

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Give me your kettle.

62
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,480
The kettle. Kettle. Kettle.

63
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
These children have not slept well

64
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
for several days.

65
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,240
They just want to make their works the ultimate,

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,000
trying to make a great coup on Sculpt the City.

67
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
They are all hardworking students.

68
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,360
Hello, headmaster.

69
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Hello, sir.

70
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
Hello, everyone.

71
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
You have worked hard.

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,480
- Not at all. - It's out duty.

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,080
Work hard for the sculpture department!

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,040
Serve the sculpture department!

75
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,120
Professor, look at this.

76
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,120
Professor, look at this.

77
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,400
You don't need to see theirs.

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,720
Theirs are perfect.

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,040
Yes, no need.

80
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,360
It's awesome. Great.

81
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,600
We are almost done.

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
In the summer when we're 19,

83
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,360
for the first time,

84
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,760
we tried our best to leave no regrets

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,360
and protect the beautiful things we love,

86
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,160
despite the outcome.

87
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,680
I have searched online.

88
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,520
Your hometown is so great

89
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
with so many places we can visit.

90
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,240
You said no every time I asked you to come.

91
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,280
I was so busy before.

92
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
See? I'm here as soon as the vacation begins.

93
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,520
I'm serious about it.

94
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,600
Do you want to visit my grandma before we go back?

95
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
Not this time.

96
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,640
We got too many plans.

97
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,960
Let's make a special trip next time

98
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,600
to show our sincerity.

99
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
Yuan Qian.

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
Qin.

101
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,640
Yuan Qian.

102
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,880
No, no. It's definitely a coincidence.

103
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
Why don't you take me with you?

104
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,080
But you gave me a copy of your itinerary.

105
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,360
We agreed to take the same train.

106
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,520
Why did you change to another one?

107
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,440
Qin.

108
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
You two don't care about friends at all.

109
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,160
How can you travel without us?

110
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Fortunately, I heard you

111
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,800
when you discussed it on the phone.

112
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,840
Qin, where are we going?

113
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,000
We should go separately.

114
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,600
We need some private space in the vacation.

115
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,880
You're right.

116
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,160
Thank you.

117
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,880
We should wait for them.

118
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,200
You two are a perfect match.

119
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
It took you the same time

120
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
to put the luggage in your room.

121
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
It takes time to put on makeup and get changed.

122
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
He is way too slow as a man.

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
I did it on purpose to let you

124
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,040
have some private time.

125
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Or Qin would

126
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,760
has a long face again.

127
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,880
I've made the order.

128
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,640
Get started.

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
I love everything you order.

130
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
Is there anything you don't like to eat?

131
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
You!

132
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:24,288
Man of my dreams.

133
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,920
Hello.

134
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,240
I'm having lunch with my classmates.

135
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,440
Have you had lunch?

136
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,280
Don't worry. I will enjoy it.

137
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,240
Impossible.

138
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,680
How can I just meet the boy I like

139
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,400
on the street?

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
Don't worry. It's not going to happen.

141
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm warning you.

142
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
Don't go near Luo Xinxin!

143
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,440
This fool is mine.

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
Challenge me one on one if you dare.

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
Are you in a position to ask me?

146
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
You don't have to know who I am.

147
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,560
I do want to be her boyfriend.

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,240
So what?

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,600
Who?

150
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,720
Dad?

151
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,240
Hello, dad.

152
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,200
That's it.

153
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
Bye.

154
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,400
Chen Qinan.

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I didn't expect you've been coveting my beauty.

156
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,520
In that case,

157
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
I will reluctantly

158
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,720
allow you to do it.

159
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,560
After all, I am kind.

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,760
Except for me,

161
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
no one would have the poor taste

162
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,960
to covet such a “heavy” woman.

163
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Keep going.

164
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,640
Keep going.

165
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,920
Mind the steps.

166
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,400
Nannan, where should we go?

167
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,080
My girl.

168
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,920
I'll go wherever you want to go.

169
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,400
There is a lover's bridge ahead.

170
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,480
Lover's bridge?

171
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,760
Where we can hang love locks?

172
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,280
The love lock symbolizing eternal love?

173
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,880
Nannan.

174
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,200
Okay, let's go to the lover's bridge.

175
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,200
Let's go.

176
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,640
Let's go.

177
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,880
Let's go.

178
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,800
My key is missing.

179
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,680
You lost it?

180
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,200
Come and look for it with me.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,320
All right. You go for it.

182
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
We will go there first.

183
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,400
Okay.

184
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,120
Bye.

185
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,600
Aren't we going to the lover's bridge?

186
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,360
It's too far.

187
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,240
Yeah. And it's hot today.

188
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,880
It's better to eat ice cream.

189
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,800
Why do you keep looking at me?

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,320
Is there ice cream on my face?

191
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,080
Your mouth is like an ice cream.

192
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,440
What's wrong with you?

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,080
What's wrong with us?

194
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
Ask your boyfriend.

195
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
This bad guy

196
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,520
played a trick with us in order to stay with you alone.

197
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,920
There is no lover's bridge.

198
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,520
It's a heartbreaking cliff.

199
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,080
Look.

200
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,320
Look at his face.

201
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
He did it on purpose.

202
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,160
We went there hand in hand.

203
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,120
But there was full of heart-broken people.

204
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
Some of them even roar towards the bottom of the cliff.

205
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,640
I was so scared and I shrank!

206
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,880
Awesome!

207
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,760
Get lost!

208
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,200
No way.

209
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,800
Give me your bag.

210
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,680
I have to punish

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,000
this insidious man.

212
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,640
You have to carry all the bags.

213
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,120
Give him yours, too.

214
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
I can pass that.

215
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,240
He didn't cheat me.

216
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,920
Give me.

217
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,680
That's more like it.

218
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,520
Let's go.

219
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,760
Hello.

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,400
Hello.

221
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,680
They disappeared buying deserts.

222
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,160
It's been 30 minutes and they haven't come back.

223
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,880
Chen Qinan said that they need another 2 or 3 hours.

224
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,080
Luo Xinxin!

225
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,720
I have downloaded a movie.

226
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,520
Don't you come?

227
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,160
Right away.

228
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,520
You can sit on the bed.

229
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,160
Didn't you say you downloaded it?

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,840
Everyone is here.

231
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,760
Why did you close the curtains during the day?

232
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,440
Should I leave

233
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,560
or stay?

234
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,560
I just came to watch a movie.

235
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,280
I see. I see.

236
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,040
Just watch a movie.

237
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,800
Qin.

238
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
You've made a fast move.

239
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,040
If I come back later…

240
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,800
You got to be beaten

241
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,320
by coming back too early.

242
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,240
Too early!

243
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Okay, I am leaving.

244
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Too early.

245
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
Let's take a group photo together.

246
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,360
It's about the end of our trip.

247
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,040
Sure.

248
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm really tired these days.

249
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,880
But I have had a good time.

250
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
Let's take it here.

251
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,440
It got a beautiful view.

252
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,040
Okay.

253
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,880
Let's stand in a row.

254
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,800
Come here.

255
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,320
Qin, we will count you in.

256
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,880
You have to take it. Come here.

257
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,680
Count me in?

258
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,720
Thank you for that.

259
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,080
You are welcome.

260
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,120
Hello, can you take a picture for us?

261
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:43,920
No problem.

262
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,360
Thank you.

263
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,400
One, two, three.

264
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,880
Cheese!

265
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,960
Done.

266
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,960
Thank you.

267
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
My god.

268
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,640
Look at Qin's face.

269
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,040
Sure enough.

270
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,920
Even a poker face looks handsome.

271
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,360
I'm handsome too.

272
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,760
Are you serious?

273
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm an honest man.

274
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,360
Even I love you,

275
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,840
but I can't lie.

276
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,720
Oho!

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,880
You are more handsome when you smile.

278
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
What about now?

279
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,040
Am I handsome?

280
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,800
Next time…

281
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,440
Next time I will come with you alone.

282
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,520
You're so scheming.

283
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,200
You tiptoed.

284
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,360
You tiptoed.

285
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,400
How could you tiptoe?

286
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,680
I am handsome.

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,960
You got short legs.

288
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,760
They are gone.

289
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,960
Your legs are short.

290
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,240
Let's go.

291
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,160
Wait me.

292
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
When will the car arrive?

293
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,040
We should have slept a little longer.

294
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,200
But the phone shows that the car has arrived.

295
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,000
That's the one.

296
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:07,920
Let's go.

297
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,800
Put it on the back seat.

298
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,560
Get in a little bit.

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,920
I'll take the bus.

300
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,240
There is one at 7.

301
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,040
I can take the bus with you.

302
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,200
Yuan Qian.

303
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
Make sure you make it in time.

304
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,560
The weather forecast says there will be a typhoon.

305
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,440
If you're late, you will miss the bus.

306
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,800
You go first.

307
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,680
Bye.

308
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,120
Now I know

309
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,520
what is "dates before mates".

310
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,680
This is how we are.

311
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,200
It's already past the 7.

312
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,560
Why isn't the bus coming?

313
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Why is it raining so heavily?

314
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,400
The bus hasn't come yet.

315
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,840
Luo Xinxin.

316
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,480
Hello, Yuan Qian.

317
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,120
The typhoon came early,

318
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,720
and all buses were suspended.

319
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,960
We are also stuck at the railway station.

320
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,680
You can look around,

321
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
see if there's a place you can live.

322
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,600
Xinxin, I got it.

323
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,080
Xinxin said that the typhoon came,

324
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,440
and there will be no buses

325
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,760
as well as trains.

326
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,960
They are waiting at the railway station now.

327
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,560
I don't think we could make it there.

328
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Really?

329
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
It seems that we can only stay here for one night

330
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,760
and wait until the typhoon stops tomorrow.

331
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,640
Okay.

332
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,960
Why do I think

333
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,280
you seem very happy hearing that we can't go back?

334
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,600
Should we find other ways

335
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,640
to get to the railway station?

336
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,400
No. No.

337
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,720
I didn't mean that.

338
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Welcome.

339
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,000
Are you two going to check in?

340
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,680
Sir, do you have two adjacent rooms?

341
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,560
I'm really sorry, young lady.

342
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,440
We only have one room left today.

343
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,560
Only one? Is it a two bed room?

344
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
There is no two bed room in B&B.

345
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,760
There is only a king size bed.

346
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,360
Shall we change to another one?

347
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,360
There is another one about 800 meters away from here.

348
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,280
Forget it.

349
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,600
It's raining so heavily,

350
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,840
and we don't have an umbrella.

351
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,480
Just stay here for one night.

352
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,000
Will you…?

353
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,040
I won't!

354
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,160
Young lady.

355
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,560
I need your ID card

356
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,840
to check in.

357
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,440
Come here to take a photo.

358
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,880
Let's play poker.

359
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,280
You do want me.

360
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,160
What a dangerous girlfriend.

361
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,920
Let's watch TV.

362
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,600
It's a bit hot here.

363
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,560
I have to get some air.

364
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,440
Don't.

365
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,920
Are you stupid?

366
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
You are all wet.

367
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,680
Go to take a bath.

368
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,480
No.

369
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,520
I won't.

370
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,960
You are both dangerous and unhygienic.

371
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,880
You can go take a bath.

372
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,120
Why can't I get through Yuan Qian's phone?

373
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,600
Poor Qianqian.

374
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,880
They missed the bus.

375
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,000
It is still raining and they don't have an umbrella.

376
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,720
And they don't even have their luggage.

377
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,160
So poor.

378
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,400
I told you not to worry.

379
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,160
Qin is there. It's okay.

380
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,960
Control your girl.

381
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,848
Chen Qinan

382
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,920
This death warning is horrible.

383
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,360
I'll try again.

384
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,360
Don't!

385
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,640
What's wrong?

386
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,320
Night has fallen.

387
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,680
A tropical cyclone is comin'.

388
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
It's pretty normal

389
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,440
that she can't get the messages you sent.

390
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,160
Everybody!

391
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,200
Enough. Enough.

392
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
It's not good for you to think too much.

393
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,040
Let's take a break

394
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,840
and contact them tomorrow, okay?

395
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,880
OK. I will stop worrying about them.

396
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
It's so nice of the boss here.

397
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,560
She gave me the last quilt.

398
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,440
Look, I asked for another quilt.

399
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,120
I told you

400
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,480
I wasn't thinking about anything.

401
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,920
I don't want to do anything to you.

402
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,400
Move over there.

403
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,160
We are both knowledgeable and educated,

404
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,160
with strong self-control.

405
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,440
Don't cross the line at night.

406
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,840
Whoever crosses the line is a dog.

407
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,360
Let's take this as the dividing line.

408
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,440
Turn off the lights and let's sleep.

409
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,120
You crossed the line!

410
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,120
We had a deal that whoever crosses the line is a dog.

411
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Calm down.

412
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,400
Do you want to be a dog?

413
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,080
Woof!

414
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,200
What's wrong with you?

415
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,200
Your luggage was stolen and you didn't notice it.

416
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,760
If you sit on the chair at the railway station all night,

417
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,240
you will be just like us.

418
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,440
Look at you.

419
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
You slept at a hotel happily.

420
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,880
We need sleep desperately.

421
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Exactly.

422
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,880
I was so worried about you yesterday

423
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,880
and I kept calling you.

424
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,000
But you didn't pick up!

425
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,920
I don't know why

426
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,160
my phone just shut down.

427
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,800
Maybe the battery was running low.

428
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,480
Impossible.

429
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,720
When I turned it on,

430
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,240
there was still 35% of the power.

431
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,680
That's its last power before it dies.

432
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,800
Anyway, it is quite strange.

433
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
You have dark circles under your eyes.

434
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,880
Tell me about it.

435
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,680
Yuan Qian.

436
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,360
Yuan Qian.

437
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
Why are you also here?

438
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,920
Let's stay away from them and not to get hurt.

439
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,520
You just finished your competition?

440
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,680
Congratulations!

441
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,840
You knew I won?

442
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,960
Of course, it's on the news.

443
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,760
Did you read the news?

444
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,480
Yuan Qian has many cups.

445
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,000
She doesn't need your trophy cup.

446
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,600
Song Siyi.

447
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,880
Coach.

448
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,960
Don't worry. I'm here to pick someone else up.

449
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
I am only interested in single girls.

450
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,920
I have to go.

451
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,520
I've known Song Siyi since we were children

452
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,600
I always bullied him.

453
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,400
After we grow up,

454
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,680
he becomes a well-known athlete

455
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,200
and has won many championships.

456
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,280
He is working hard for the new dream.

457
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,480
Haven't seen enough?

458
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,280
Let's go.

459
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:29,368
Three Years Later

460
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,680
We won the "Sculpt the City"

461
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,120
by our works naming "Reborn from Ashes" that year.

462
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,680
We had a big moment in that competition.

463
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,200
First, I want to thank the prize,

464
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,480
which encouraged us a lot.

465
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,400
We joined the competition for winning the prize

466
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,880
and making the sculpture department famous.

467
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,800
Although, we've gone through a lot,

468
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,360
the story has a happy ending.

469
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,040
Thank you for your support and participation.

470
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,920
At last,

471
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,000
I hope you, seniors in high school,

472
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
can apply for our university.

473
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,280
We are waiting for you here.

474
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,000
This is the result of you staying up all night.

475
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,360
How about it?

476
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,120
You'd better stick to sculpture.

477
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,160
I asked you to write for me, but you didn't.

478
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
Let's go. It's our turn.

479
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,680
Take it easy. Let's go.

480
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,960
The sculpture department regained its reputation

481
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,080
and resumed admissions.

482
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,320
The admissions office was full of students

483
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,000
who wanted to get in the next year.

484
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,080
Yes.

485
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,800
We secured the sculpture department.

486
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,080
Qin Shen.

487
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,920
Happy graduation.

488
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,400
Yuan Qian.

489
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,560
Just lend me a hug for a while.

490
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,680
Just for a while.

491
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,360
Happy graduation.

492
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,880
Yuan Qian, let's take a photo together.

493
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,360
Qin Shen.

494
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,320
Come on.

495
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,000
3. 2. 1.

496
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,000
Done.

497
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,120
Let me see it.

498
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,320
Qin Shen.

499
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,240
Look at your poor skill!

500
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,760
It's distorted. How can I use it?

501
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,640
In the past three years...

502
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,000
It's fine.

503
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,240
...Jia Sicheng has gone through

504
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,720
the bottleneck period,

505
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,920
and found his inspiration.

506
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,480
He and Qin Shen are friends again.

507
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,760
He has signed the contract with a studio,

508
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,560
and he has a promising future.

509
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,840
Honey, it was my fault.

510
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,040
I will only use the beauty camera,

511
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,280
not the normal one again.

512
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
I will use beauty camera to take photos for you, OK?

513
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,240
Beauty camera all the time.

514
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,480
All over my phone.

515
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,440
It won't work.

516
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,840
Can I let you sit, please?

517
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,000
I am so tired.

518
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,760
What do you say?

519
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,560
You want to sit? Just stand here.

520
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,240
Stand here forever.

521
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,360
Why are you quarreling again?

522
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,000
Yuan Qian, help!

523
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,600
I forgot to use the beauty camera

524
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,440
when I took photos of her.

525
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,360
She is angry and I can't make her happy.

526
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,640
Why don't you know her at all?

527
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,280
You are really her boyfriend?

528
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,640
Exactly!

529
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,400
You know that he is your boyfriend?

530
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,200
Why are you angry at such a trivial matter.

531
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,600
Exactly!

532
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,840
I will forgive you this time

533
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,880
for Yuan Qian's sake.

534
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,160
Come on. Chen Qinan.

535
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,760
Take a photo for me and Yuan Qian.

536
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
Make sure you use the beauty camera.

537
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,120
Okay.

538
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,600
You are the best!

539
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,240
Let me see.

540
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,880
Chen Qinan!

541
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,440
I…

542
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,440
What's this?

543
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,080
It hurts.

544
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,880
Luo Xinxin and Chen Qinan

545
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,200
are finally together.

546
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,160
They still have a long way of happiness to go.

547
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,520
Yuan Qian, come on!

548
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,760
Take photos with us!

549
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,920
Coming!

550
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,360
Ready.

551
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,280
1. 2. 3.

552
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,200
Let me see.

553
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,840
Let me take a photo for you two.

554
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,400
Okay.

555
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,360
Ready.

556
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,520
3. 2. 1.

557
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,880
Lu Jianing and Yi Ming

558
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,840
are still single.

559
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,520
They stick to it till now.

560
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,320
Be normal.

561
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,680
Behave yourself.

562
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,240
1. 2. 3.

563
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,440
Can you two get closer?

564
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
No way.

565
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,640
Okay, all right.

566
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,080
It's our turn to take a photo.

567
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,040
Let's go out and take pictures.

568
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,080
Let's go!

569
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,080
Go!

570
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,520
Let's go!

571
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,280
Let's go, honey!

572
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,680
Yuan Qian.

573
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,720
Happy graduation!

574
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,960
Xue Congyang found a job.

575
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,320
She's been working hard during the years,

576
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,200
and became a lot more confident.

577
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,360
She could finally

578
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
say her wish out loud.

579
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,160
You don't know how to wear clothes for three years.

580
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,240
Let's go to take pictures.

581
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,560
Chen Qinan, take it for me.

582
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,200
Sure.

583
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,160
Come on.

584
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,560
Qin Shen, come here.

585
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,600
Qin Shen, are you recording us?

586
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,640
Qinan, the hat.

587
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,800
Xinxin.

588
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,840
I lost my graduation certificate.

589
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,440
Can't you eat less?

590
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,760
I've been on a diet.

591
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,840
Xinxin, look.

592
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,040
3. 2. 1.

593
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,760
Qin.

594
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,160
Qin Shen. Yuan Qian.

595
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,000
Ling Wei, happy graduation.

596
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,120
Happy graduation.

597
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,440
You are back?

598
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,040
I'm here to celebrate for my graduation.

599
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,680
By the way, you are so happy together.

600
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,320
Thank you.

601
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,800
Qin Shen.

602
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,360
I'm not used to

603
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,760
you talking to me like this.

604
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,520
Ling Wei and Qin Shen has finally talked it through

605
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,200
and became friends.

606
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,360
She chose to continue her study of dancing

607
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,200
in the graduate school.

608
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,320
Is it itchy?

609
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,280
Come on, everyone.

610
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,440
Be ready to take a photo.

611
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,840
You are so lazy!

612
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,400
3. 2. 1.

613
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,560
Happy graduation!

614
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Is your mother here?

615
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,800
It's okay.

616
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,000
Then I will play your mother

617
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
and hug you for her.

618
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,080
I, Yuan Qian,

619
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,080
used to be an expert on staying single.

620
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,360
Now I get everyone jealous of my happy relationship.

621
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,200
Only when I met Qin Shen did I understand that

622
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,560
I was so good at being single

623
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,840
because I was not ready for love.

624
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,800
Learn to communicate and be considerate.

625
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,560
Be the best version of yourself in the end.

626
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,440
The relationship is not only about two of us staying together,

627
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,640
but also each of us growing for it.

628
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,960
Miss. Yuan Qian.

629
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,800
Can you be my girlfriend?

630
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,640
From first love to eternity.

631
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,040
Thank you. I love it.

632
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,080
Maybe this is the meaning of love.
