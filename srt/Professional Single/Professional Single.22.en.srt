1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 22

3
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,920
Why doesn't Yuan Qian come here?

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,800
Her phone's still in the bag.

5
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
Give me the bag.

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,480
You can leave first.

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,280
OK. I'll go now.

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
You can start off a while after.

9
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,880
OK, be quick.

10
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,880
You didn't leave with the bus?

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,960
Then you can take my car.

12
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,880
Sir, you can leave first.

13
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
I have to print the documents

14
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,040
about the museum with Yuan Qian.

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,640
Be quick.

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:23,960
OK.

17
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,440
Give me the bag.

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,800
Give me the camera.

19
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,880
No.

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,080
Let's go for a walk.

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
Now finally you figure out

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,240
how to explain me

23
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,480
about your disappearance these days.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,440
No.

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
Then let's continue to break up.

26
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,560
Something happened to my family.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
I have to go back.

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,800
And then?

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,360
And my phone has been powered off.

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
You've been kidding with me in grandma's house.

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,102
Suddenly, you disappeared and your phone's powered off.

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
I didn't know how to tell you.

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
Actually, I wasn't really

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
angry or sad before.

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
I just wanted to tease you

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,520
and made you coax me happy.

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
But just now

38
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,000
I really felt the sense of loss.

39
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,680
When I couldn't find you,

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I feel like I know nothing about you.

41
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,360
I didn't even know you as much as Ling Wei did.

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,680
Honestly, that's a lot for a girl to deal with.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
But I told myself that

44
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,800
as soon as you get back,

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,040
I'm sure you'll come to me and explain it.

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
But you didn't.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,440
I don't want there are secrets

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,554
that can't be exchanged between us.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,240
I do wish I can enter your world.

50
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Yuan Qian.

51
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,680
Did you quarrel with Qin Shen?

52
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
No wonder he was in and out all day

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,920
and changed the water or the mud frequently.

54
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,760
His going in and out have something to do with me?

55
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
Of course.

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,440
It'll have a reason to get out.

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,080
He passed you

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,880
just to get a closer look at you.

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Qin Shen.

60
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
I heard you quarreled with Yuan Qian.

61
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,560
I heard you went back and didn't say anything to her.

62
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,760
You don't like her that much, do you?

63
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,400
What makes you have such a delusion?

64
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,280
Did you go back because of your mother?

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,600
None of your business.

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,360
If you like her so much,

67
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,960
you'll tell her everything.

68
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,120
If she likes you so much,

69
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,480
she won't mind the problems of your family.

70
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,160
Your relationship was originally precarious.

71
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,720
You didn't let her enter your world,

72
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,240
did you?

73
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
I've fallen in love with Yuan Qian

74
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
and I won't change it.

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,160
Qin Shen.

76
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,040
But you're right, too.

77
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,360
She won't mind it if she likes me.

78
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,680
I'll think about the best way

79
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,480
to lead her into my world.

80
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,160
What?

81
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,800
You take me as a laughingstock?

82
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,400
I didn't laugh at you.

83
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,240
Why are you with Qin Shen?

84
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
I liked him for so many years.

85
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,900
I've always been discreet

86
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,120
and was afraid to get too close to him.

87
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,400
I was almost there.

88
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,800
But your appearance destroyed my half-built way to success.

89
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Take it rationally.

90
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,800
Look...

91
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
You can be a princess in front of others.

92
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,520
Why do you have to demean yourself

93
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
in front of him?

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,160
Ling Wei.

95
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
It's not worth to do that.

96
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,520
That's because you got him.

97
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,080
You can say such sarcastic words.

98
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,394
You have no idea about the feeling

99
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,457
that you want to love but you can't,

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,600
and want to give up but you can't.

101
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
What princess?

102
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,840
I don't care.

103
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,800
All I've ever wanted

104
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,720
was Qin Shen.

105
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,360
But you appeared in the middle and took his heart.

106
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,520
No. Ling Wei. I...

107
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,440
Why have I been giving you

108
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
a run for him?

109
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,920
Why?

110
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,520
I... I'm listening to you.

111
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,200
You! Let go of me.

112
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,280
I... I'm listening to you.

113
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,840
Everybody, everybody.

114
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,560
Yuan Qian and Ling Wei are having a fight.

115
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
What?

116
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,560
What's the situation?

117
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,360
Fatty, hurry up.

118
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
Wait for me. Wait.

119
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,680
Hello, Qin.

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Where have you been?

121
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,440
Ling Wei had beat Yuan Qian.

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,560
Come here quickly.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,440
Yuan Qian.

124
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,702
What's going on? Take it easy.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,600
Keep calm.

126
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,920
Don't get us wrong.

127
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,360
Get up, Yuan Qian.

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,280
Qin.

129
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,280
Be careful.

130
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,240
What's wrong?

131
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,760
Qin Shen.

132
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,000
I didn't.

133
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm all right. Don't get angry.

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't let me see you again.

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,760
That's not true. You all listen to me.

136
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,600
Lin Wei didn't...

137
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
She didn't push me.

138
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
You got it wrong.

139
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,840
Wipe it.

140
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,760
It's not suitable for you to cry in public.

141
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,920
All right, go, go, go.

142
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,880
Go back. Don't take photos.

143
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,040
Go away, go away.

144
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
What're you looking at? Let's go.

145
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,800
Let's go.

146
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,360
Thank you.

147
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,280
Please walk slowly.

148
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,560
Sorry.

149
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,400
Why do you say sorry?

150
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm late.

151
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,440
That just scared me to death.

152
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,000
I thought you could not control yourself

153
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,800
and beat Ling Wei.

154
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,680
The point is I fell in there myself.

155
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,920
But you didn't listen to me.

156
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,440
It makes me an evil costar in the TV series.

157
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,600
In order to win sympathy,

158
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,600
I deliberately made an illusion that the leading actress hit me.

159
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,160
I was really angry just now

160
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,280
and wanted to use a set of Pegasus Meteor Fist.

161
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,000
It turns out that you're like a mortal sometimes.

162
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,680
I'm dirty.

163
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,280
I'm glad you're ok.

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,520
Have you had it enough?

165
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,840
Don't take it

166
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,800
as a make up.

167
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680
I've written down in my note

168
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,880
about your absence without notice.

169
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
We just reconciled for five minutes.

170
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
Weather we can keep our reconciled status

171
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,800
is depended on your explanation.

172
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,640
I'll go back first.

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,880
Listen, I'm not a pushover.

174
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,680
Your work is not as good as mine.

175
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,200
Guys, you've been working hard.

176
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,200
Have some water.

177
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,880
Thank you, sir.

178
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,520
- Thanks, Dad. - Thank you, sir.

179
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,760
Thank you, sir.

180
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Thank you, sir.

181
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,440
Monitor.

182
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:34,920
Send them.

183
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,480
I thought that

184
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,880
you may not have time to prepare for extracurricular practice.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
So I'll take the works in this sculpture exhibition

186
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,960
as the score of your extracurricular practice.

187
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,480
Long live the teacher.

188
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,080
In my opinion,

189
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,800
do it by yourselves

190
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,480
is not good as coordinate in groups.

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
By collecting our wisdom,

192
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,080
there'll be a greater chance to win.

193
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,445
According to the situation of our class,

194
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll choose three team leaders.

195
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,400
Qin Shen.

196
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,480
Jia Sicheng.

197
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,360
Yuan Qian.

198
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,800
You three, air your opinions.

199
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
Do you have confidence?

200
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,680
Yes.

201
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,000
- Yes. - Yes. Yes. Yes.

202
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,960
Definitely yes.

203
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,000
Can you say something?

204
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,160
Qin Shen is in charge of the three groups.

205
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
The time is too tight.

206
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,150
And the task is difficult.

207
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
So students,

208
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,000
establish the direction of creation ASAP.

209
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,640
I believe you. Beat it!

210
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,840
- Come on! - Sir, don't worry.

211
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,640
Don't worry, sir.

212
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,280
We'll do our best.

213
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,120
OK.

214
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,800
In my opinion,

215
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,080
we can combine it with the style of MGA.

216
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,805
For example, make some popular manga characters,

217
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,480
game characters and so on.

218
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,680
Emoticons are also fine.

219
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,680
This is more in line with the aesthetic of young people,

220
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,680
and is also fancy and lovable.

221
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,400
I think it's fine.

222
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,240
I agree.

223
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,920
I don't approve it.

224
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
The theme of urban sculpture

225
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,080
should present local customs and features.

226
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,680
Although the style of MGA is fancy,

227
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,080
it does not stick to the theme.

228
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,760
We shall think more

229
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,720
in the direction of customs.

230
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,960
Who will really interpret

231
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
the meaning behind the sculpture?

232
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,200
What everyone needs is the visual impact.

233
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,800
Of course, people will be interested in

234
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,200
the popular and novel elements.

235
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,080
People can all get online now.

236
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,080
Others can't get the point you can get, right?

237
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,520
How do you know if you don't try?

238
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,440
We can't afford a bet.

239
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,400
Yuan Qian.

240
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,240
You shall decide it.

241
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,440
Whose direction is more suitable?

242
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,680
I think Qin Shen's more appropriate.

243
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,600
The exhibition of urban sculpture

244
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,120
is about depth, not catering.

245
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,542
I think what Yuan Qian said is reasonable.

246
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,640
I agree with Qin, too.

247
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,200
Me, too.

248
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,120
I follow Yuan Qian.

249
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,400
We all follow Yuan Qian.

250
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,360
Excuse me.

251
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,440
You choose the direction I propose

252
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,400
just because my direction

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,600
fits the theme of the competition?

254
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,960
Or what?

255
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,520
You think I support you unconditionally

256
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,960
because you are my boyfriend?

257
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,360
You think too much.

258
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,560
I dare not pretend to be your girlfriend.

259
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,040
How can a girlfriend

260
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,840
doesn't even know the whereabouts of her boyfriend?

261
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,280
My mother has never supported me to learn sculpture.

262
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,160
None of my business.

263
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,440
She was ill

264
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,680
and was in hospital

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
because I insisted.

266
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Is she all right?

267
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,000
Much better.

268
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,760
I went back to see her this time.

269
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I wanted to confide to her,

270
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,840
but it was useless.

271
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,080
There is a bloody storm at home.

272
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,440
I was afraid if I tell you,

273
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
you would just worried in vain.

274
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,680
Whatever the reason is,

275
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,320
you should tell me.

276
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,240
I'm willing to worry about you.

277
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,080
It's my fault.

278
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,280
I apologize.

279
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,600
It's good

280
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,400
that a rock cold as you are willing to apologize.

281
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
But I still want to tell you,

282
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
I want more.

283
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,560
I hope you can tell me everything.

284
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,120
You're right.

285
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,360
Besides,

286
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
even if I, a professional woman,

287
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,960
quarrel with you,

288
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,040
I will be the side of calm.

289
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,320
But I don't want you to be like this.

290
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,600
Why?

291
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,280
Because my woman

292
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,760
doesn't need to be proessional.

293
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
Just support me unconditionally.

294
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,880
I support you unconditionally now.

295
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
I decided not to transfer

296
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,680
and to keep the sculpture department together.

297
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,480
I got it. I got it.

298
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,320
A brief introduction.

299
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,800
On which page?

300
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,520
Page fifty-two.

301
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,080
You have a good memory.

302
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,800
That's the way it should be.

303
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,560
Don't be disheartened.

304
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,720
I know you don't like this

305
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,908
custom-basked scheme very much.

306
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,360
But there's no other way.

307
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,880
That's the general direction.

308
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,520
I also know that it's hard for you

309
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,845
to use the elements of custom naturally.

310
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,640
This is my progress for the time being.

311
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,720
I can only say let's work hard together.

312
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,040
We'll go over the idea draft at 3:00.

313
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,880
If it can be polished,

314
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,760
it will be submitted to Professor Jin.

315
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,640
OK, OK.

316
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,920
You think this one is OK?

317
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,600
I think it's OK.

318
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,960
Same as the last two.

319
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,200
If you keep this attitude,

320
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,480
I don't see any point in wasting time.

321
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,560
OK.

322
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,000
Your design is fine.

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,440
But this base may need to be

324
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,680
made a little bigger.

325
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,680
Have you discussed with each other?

326
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,280
Sir.

327
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,040
Qin Shen totally denied our first draft.

328
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,480
Have you ever wondered

329
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
why he totally denied you?

330
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,920
Sicheng,

331
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,520
I think you should open your mind.

332
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
Think about it again.

333
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,960
Sir.

334
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,880
This is the third time.

335
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
I know you work hard.

336
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,320
But your work didn't pass.

337
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,240
You have to continue to work on it.

338
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,120
What do you think?

339
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,600
OK.

340
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,360
Sir.

341
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,800
I came to get the latest news.

342
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,400
The latest news is that

343
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,320
Qin Shen's group's work has passed.

344
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,520
It is now being revised and improved.

345
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,720
It should be.

346
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,560
The general direction is decided by Qin Shen.

347
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,040
I guess he already has some ideas then.

348
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
What about your group?

349
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,320
My design has been given to Qin Shen.

350
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,245
It's already passed.

351
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,200
But the specific way of presentation

352
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,720
still needs to be modified.

353
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,680
OK.

354
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,120
What about Jia Sicheng's team?

355
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
I also want to ask you about something.

356
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,080
Do you have gaps

357
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,000
between the group leaders?

358
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,120
It's all right.

359
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,360
When we're sharing inspirations,

360
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,320
there will inevitably be some different opinions.

361
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,440
But I don't see a problem.

362
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,760
Jia Sicheng

363
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,720
showed me a few of his works.

364
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,480
But I'm not satisfied.

365
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,200
If you have time, you can talk to him with Qin Shen.

366
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,280
You know, if the gap between classmates is too large,

367
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
it will affect their enthusiasm.

368
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,360
All right.

369
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,560
Then I'll find time to talk to Jia Sicheng.

370
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,280
OK.

371
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
Well, thank you.

372
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,240
But after the chat,

373
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,400
you have to work hard.

374
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,920
Qin Shen is still better than you.

375
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,240
I'll go and talk to him now.

376
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,160
Goodbye, teacher.

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,680
Jia Sicheng.

378
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,720
What are you doing here?

379
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,760
I heard your team's having a rough time.

380
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,960
Is there anything I can do for you?

381
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,200
Why are you pretending to be kind here?

382
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,440
You chose the ideas of your boyfriend

383
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,622
for your own happiness

384
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,165
and killed all the ideas of our group directly.

385
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,720
Our new direction has always been denied.

386
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,720
Everyone in our group is very depressed now.

387
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,680
Are you satisfied?

388
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,280
You...

389
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,240
I heard all the sweet words between you and Qin Shen.

390
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,320
The reason I chose Qin Shen is that

391
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,640
the theme of the competition is already there.

392
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,560
Although your proposal is very popular with everyone.

393
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,840
That can't represent

394
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,800
the special cultural theme of Xuanzhou.

395
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,537
Even if it's good, it strays from the point.

396
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Then we can't win.

397
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,497
The exhibition of urban sculpture is a mainstream award.

398
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,680
Aren't we going to the competition for award?

399
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,720
We have to let the mainstream recognize us

400
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,440
and take us good.

401
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,960
We're not meant to amuse the public first

402
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,240
and then can be forgotten.

403
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,760
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,680
I was too impulsive.

405
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,400
I'm just a little confused

406
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,200
about the theme of the game.

407
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,520
My understanding is not very good, either.

408
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,720
We can talk about it.

409
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,920
You've bought food?

410
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,760
There'll be nothing left the time you come.

411
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,240
I was just chatting with someone.

412
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,640
Jia Sicheng?

413
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,920
How do you know that?

414
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
I saw it.

415
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:50,960
What were you talking about?

416
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,880
You were happy.

417
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,520
Qin Shen, what food did you buy today?

418
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,405
Why does it taste sour?

419
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,040
Specialty of Shanxi Province.

420
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,440
Why are you so jealous now?

421
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,120
Can't I talk to boys?

422
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,920
Not even the male mosquito.

423
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,080
Yuan Qian.

424
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,800
I'm almost done.

425
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,960
Very good.

426
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,000
Yuan Qian.

427
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
How is your group going?

428
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,400
We're almost done.

429
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,760
Just a little bit left.

430
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,960
When it's done,

431
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,240
I promise it'll surprise you in a good way.

432
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,680
Naughty.

433
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,520
Look at this idea, everyone.

434
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,080
I'm praising you that you have made progress.

435
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,200
Why are you so shy to show it to everyone?

436
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,840
Look, everybody.

437
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,640
Sicheng has made progress this time.

438
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
I was thinking

439
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,622
if the relationship between college students and the city

440
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,520
is just like that between mother and children,

441
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,800
which is very inclusive.

442
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,160
Then I can start from this level.

443
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,120
Yuan Qian.

444
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,680
Come and show us your idea.

445
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,200
I don't think so.

446
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,360
Mine is nothing

447
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,640
compared to Jia Sicheng's.

448
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,600
When I'm done,

449
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,120
I'll give it to you, sir.

450
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,800
What's wrong with you today?

451
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,360
All right.

452
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,760
Show it to me when you are ready.

453
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,400
Qin Shen,

454
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,800
come with me to the office.

455
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,120
All right.

456
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,880
Sir.

457
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,680
Look at mine.

458
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,588
Mine can be showed around.

459
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,640
I have no time.

460
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,720
You're also making it in the same direction?

461
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,720
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,120
I didn't know you were giving me an example of

463
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,560
your creative direction the other day.

464
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,160
It's all right. It's all right.

465
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,000
I didn't make myself clear.

466
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,160
It's all right.

467
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,600
Because of my vote,

468
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
you chose a direction you're not good at.

469
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,080
You go ahead and do it.

470
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,960
I'll change another one.

471
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,480
Why are you here again?

472
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,080
You scared me to death.

473
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,520
What's the situation?

474
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,360
It's another day to scratch your skull for new ideas.

475
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,760
Why did you suddenly give up

476
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,800
your city breast-feeding plan?

477
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,640
A few days ago,

478
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,320
there was something wrong with Jia Sicheng.

479
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
I just talked to him.

480
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,760
I took my idea for example.

481
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,720
But I didn't make it clear

482
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,320
that was my creative direction.

483
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,000
He used your idea directly?

484
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Sort of.

485
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
But it's my fault.

486
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,680
I didn't make myself clear.

487
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,720
But I find it weird.

488
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,120
Jia Sicheng's level seems to have dropped.

489
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,840
His level has really been dropping.

490
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,960
He hasn't been himself lately.

491
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
Is it because the direction we choose

492
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,360
limits his play?

493
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,400
Don't think about it first.

494
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,120
Now that your idea is being used,

495
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
you need to set a new direction.

496
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,440
I'll find you some books that will help.

497
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,240
I got it. I got it.

498
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,240
Stroke the fur the wrong way?

499
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,040
I'll tidy it up.

500
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,360
Now that you can see that I'm flattering you.

501
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,520
Why don't you help me figure out my creative direction?

502
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,560
As an artist,

503
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,440
you should have the ability to think independently.

504
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,320
I don't want to be an artist now.

505
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,800
I want to be Qin Shen's girlfriend.

506
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,280
You are an artist

507
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
and also my girlfriend.

508
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Since you know I'm your girlfriend,

509
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,520
then you should help your girlfriend

510
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
think of the creation plan.

511
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,160
I can't make an artist

512
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,320
lose her ability to think.

513
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
Heartless boyfriend.

514
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,920
Qin Shen?

515
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,680
Did you collect this?

516
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,920
Or who did this?

517
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,080
They're all on creative ideas.

518
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Yes.

519
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,680
There may be something useful.

520
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,920
Is this a tender moment of a heartless boyfriend?

521
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
No, no, no. I was wrong.

522
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,520
You are a tender boyfriend.

523
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,251
Just a little heartless once in a while.

524
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
I'm praising you.

525
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,320
Thank you.

526
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,680
I put together some ideas and directions yesterday.

527
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,120
Everyone should know about it in the group.

528
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,920
Let's set the

529
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,280
theme and content today.

530
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,640
Take a vote.

531
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,480
What direction do you think is better?

532
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,200
I think the direction of sports is better.

533
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,960
The level of sports of Xuanzhou

534
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,680
has been developed rapidly in the past two years.

535
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,560
I agree.

536
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,885
There are many projects and talents

537
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,508
in the Physical Department of our university.

538
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,120
We can ask them

539
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,160
at that time.

540
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,840
I was going to choose the direction of the sea view.

541
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
But after listening to your ideas,

542
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,160
I also think the direction of sports is better.

543
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,080
In fact, I was thinking about the direction of sports.

544
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,240
The theme of sports

545
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,680
can better fit the development and changes of the city.

546
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,840
I think that

547
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
if we do this project,

548
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,920
we can ask Song Siyi to be the model.

549
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,280
What a cheese for eyes.

550
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,520
That makes sense.

551
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,200
We should ask the athlete to be the model.

552
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,720
But Song Siyi.

553
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,800
If I don't tell Qin Shen,

554
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,560
he's gonna be unhappy.

555
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,840
What if I talk to him first?

556
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,920
I agree.

557
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,240
Song Siyi is perfect.

558
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,040
Handsome and in good shape.

559
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,360
And he knows us well.

560
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,400
You evil people always want to harm me.

561
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,805
Well, can you think of anyone

562
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,200
more suitable than Song Siyi?

563
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,800
Exactly.

564
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,920
Li Yuanhang.

565
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,360
Are they at the same level?

566
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,040
You might as well be looking for Chen Qinan.

567
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
It's all right.

568
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,600
We all agree to ask Song Siyi.

569
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,120
Agree.

570
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,360
I got it in my nose?

571
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,880
No, no.

572
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,600
I just think the way you eat is very beautiful,

573
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,120
and I can't help looking at you more.

574
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,640
Well, then have a look.

575
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,400
I have something to discuss with you.

576
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
Our group is doing the direction of sports,

577
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,760
do you know that?

578
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,520
It was you who made me think of this idea.

579
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,400
You are welcome.

580
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,000
No.

581
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,200
I mean

582
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,120
our group's looking for a model?

583
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,400
And then...

584
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,680
Song Siyi?

585
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,120
Well, what do you think?

586
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,960
Am I discussing it with you?

587
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,360
No way.

588
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
I'm already your girlfriend.

589
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,640
Can you be a little confident, my mate, Qin Shen?

590
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,840
And we're doing this for the project.

591
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,400
If we find a model outside our school,

592
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,440
the chances of winning award will be much lessen.

593
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,320
I'm doing this for the honor of our group.

594
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,120
Then you have to promise me a few requests.

595
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,640
What?

596
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,760
As long as it's not too far.

597
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,040
No contact with him.

598
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,440
That's OK.

599
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,200
Don't look him in the eye for over five seconds.

600
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,720
That's OK.

601
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,560
All activities involving Song Siyi

602
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,720
must be reported in advance.

603
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,840
It's OK.

604
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,914
Go with me to meet grandma in the summer vacation.

605
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,200
What?

606
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,005
I don't think it's appropriate.

607
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,160
Then replace Song Siyi.

608
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,440
Well.

609
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,560
That's OK, too.

610
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,760
I'll accompany you back in the summer vacation.

611
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,240
OK.

612
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,960
It happens every time.

613
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:02,160
Every time you get the goods on me,

614
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,800
you force me to sign the clause of humiliation.

615
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,360
Then replace Song Siyi.

616
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,520
Why are you so obsessed with

617
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,794
taking me back to your hometown?

618
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,360
You forgot who did something indecent

619
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,640
to the video?

620
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,800
If you don't come back with me

621
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,120
and change my grandmother's impression on you,

622
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,280
grandma will think I have a problem with tastes.

623
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,040
OK, I'll go.

624
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,120
Yuan Qian.

625
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,360
Song Siyi.

626
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,480
When will you go back to school?

627
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,280
This week.

628
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,280
I just finished this phase of my training.

629
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,040
That's great. I shall ask you a favor.

630
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,240
Tell me.

631
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,000
What's the matter?

632
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,680
We are going to do the sculpture about sports recently.

633
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,520
Everyone says

634
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,937
that you are the most suitable model.

635
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,280
Asking me to be a model?

636
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,840
Yes.

637
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,200
My roommates said

638
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,160
you can increase our chances of winning award.

639
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,680
OK.

640
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,800
Well, thank you very much.

641
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,600
Contact me when you're back.

642
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,680
I'll invite you to dinner.

643
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,760
Ok.

644
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,400
Grilled shrimp cakes.

645
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,880
Beef.

646
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,280
Roast goose.

647
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,040
Roast goose.

648
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,600
Roast Duck.

649
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,520
Steamed pork belly with preserved greens.

650
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,560
Steamed pork belly...

651
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,040
Ok.

652
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Are you all done?

653
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,760
That's enough.

654
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Let's see if there's anything else you want to eat.

655
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,840
If there's no more, I'll tell the waiter.

656
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,720
Right.

657
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,480
Today's protagonist is Song Siyi.

658
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,000
You can order some more dishes.

659
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,840
That's enough. We can order if it's not sufficient.

660
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,760
Give me the bag.

661
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,520
All right, put it here.

662
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,640
OK.

663
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,440
I'm done.

664
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,120
All right.

665
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,800
Thanks.

666
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,200
Song Siyi,

667
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,480
do you usually train hard?

668
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,600
It's hard.

669
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,760
It's more intense than it used to be.

670
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,080
Here. Here you go.

671
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,200
Thank you!

672
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,720
Thank you!

673
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,920
Hello.

674
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,000
Where are you?

675
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,520
I'm eating in a restaurant near our school.

676
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,320
Song Siyi is back.

677
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,240
Our group want to invite Song Siyi to have a meal.

678
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,760
I just came along.

679
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,360
You agreed to report it in advance.

680
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,360
It was all of a sudden and I didn't have time.

681
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,320
Which restaurant?

682
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,240
I'll be right there.

683
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,320
You want to come here now?

684
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
I havn't had dinner.

685
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,960
I can't come?

686
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,000
Ok.

687
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,320
All right.

688
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,040
Qin Shen heard that

689
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,080
we would invite Song Siyi to dinner.

690
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,040
He wants to come over.

691
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,040
Qin Shen watches you too closely.

692
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
It's called crisis awareness.

693
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,280
No.

694
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,320
It's because that he's good brothers with Song Siyi.

695
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,400
Yes.

696
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,960
He came to see me specially.

697
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,120
Eat.

698
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,160
Eat, eat, eat.

699
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,440
Eat, eat, eat.

700
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,520
What else do you want to eat?

701
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,920
Yuan Qian.

702
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,480
This is your favorite fried shrimp cake.

703
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,400
It's been so long.

704
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,840
In fact, I don't like it so much.
