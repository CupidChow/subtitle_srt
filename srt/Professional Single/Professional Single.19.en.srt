1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 19

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,880
Here we are!

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,480
Wait for me.

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,680
It's said

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,520
the peach blossom bindi here is magical.

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,840
Those who had it all found their lovers.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,520
Really?

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
This is the bindi?

10
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,560
It's almost my turn. See you in there.

11
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,080
Let's go.

12
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
I haven't got the bindi.

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,040
You're sure you want it?

14
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
No. No.

15
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,640
So beautiful.

16
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,560
Where's Qin?

17
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,760
Yuan Qian was behind me just now.

18
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,720
Where are them?

19
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,840
Yeah.

20
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Yuan Qian,

21
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,680
Yuan Qian sent me a message

22
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,640
saying she met a friend

23
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,040
and she will join us later

24
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,080
after their meeting.

25
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,360
She told us to enjoy ourselves.

26
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Let's go there.

27
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,520
Okay.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,320
I'll call Qin.

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
Wait for me.

30
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,120
Qin, where are you?

31
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,520
I ran into a friend.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
I've already used this excuse.

33
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,160
You ran into a friend,

34
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,880
and so did Yuan Qian.

35
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,240
Are you the friends of each other?

36
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,720
I didn't see her. Busy. Bye.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,840
Okay.

38
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,560
Will they suspect us?

39
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
If he has an average IQ,

40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
he will.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,880
But his IQ is always below average.

42
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Forget it. Just enjoy the moment.

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,320
We've walked for a whole day.

44
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
Crowded and tiring.

45
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,120
Sorry.

46
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Thank you.

47
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,560
I am a bright spot light in this oil painting

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,540
And you are the living sculpture, reserved and taciturn

49
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,840
There's a road in the middle of us

50
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,120
Is it our destiny to be separated like parallel lines?

51
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,420
No matter how many virtues you have, you are just a narcissist

52
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,300
It's my talent to be single, I am just afraid of being in love

53
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,450
The more nonsense we talked, the more illusion I have

54
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,600
Like a beautiful dream that appeared indistinctly

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,000
Finally I admit you are the one in my heart

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,780
The moment I met you, I forget myself

57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,160
Saliva.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,710
All my naughty behaviors are allowed

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,370
You just turn a blind eye

60
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,770
Finally you admit I am the one in your heart

61
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,480
Take off my armor, be brave and serious

62
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,680
What a wonderful fate

63
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,200
Too many dreams are waiting to be realized

64
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,180
Finally you admit I am the one in your heart

65
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,960
The moment I met you, we are like one

66
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,500
There is no need to say another word

67
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,390
All growth rings of our lives

68
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,960
Here we are.

69
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,080
Wait for me.

70
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,800
Let's go.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,720
Go.

72
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,750
Even the dark clouds hide in the clear sky from you

73
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,900
Sneak a glance

74
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,410
And our love lasts forever

75
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
I want to eat something good.

76
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,840
Let's find a place.

77
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,560
Wei.

78
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,040
No wonder women of the ancient times were so elegant.

79
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,400
They had lots of jewelries to choose.

80
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,080
Han-style clothes are magic.

81
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
Once a girl wears it,

82
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,640
she wants to buy some jewelries to match it.

83
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
When a woman wants to go shopping,

84
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,360
she has all kinds of reasons.

85
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
What happened?

86
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,440
- What are you looking for? - I think I saw Qin Shen.

87
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Qin Shen again?

88
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,640
I take you here to get some fresh air,

89
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,960
but you're still thinking about him.

90
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
If so it's a waste of time.

91
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,520
Well.

92
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,120
Go on.

93
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,720
How's it? Is it good?

94
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Not bad.

95
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,120
How about

96
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,120
this one? Is it good?

97
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,360
I think the first one is better.

98
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Then why did you say “not bad”?

99
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,720
“Not bad” stands for “very good”.

100
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,250
129 ¥

101
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,720
Forget it.

102
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,720
I don't usually wear it.

103
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,160
Give it to me.

104
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,520
You want to try it on?

105
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,600
Hello. I'll take it.

106
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
129 yuan.

107
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,920
Please scan the QR code.

108
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,880
Thank you.

109
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,920
In ancient times,

110
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,360
did all the husband help their wives

111
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,440
wear hairpins this way?

112
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,040
I, I don't mean that.

113
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
You can mean that.

114
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,320
In fact it matches well your clothes.

115
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
Thank you.

116
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,720
Here.

117
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
You went shopping?

118
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
I thought you went to the toilet.

119
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Rice cake.

120
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,200
It's colorful and looks good,

121
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,760
so I bought it for you.

122
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,600
The first one has a filling of red bean.

123
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,280
I like red bean.

124
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,280
I am so tired today.

125
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,120
Seems I am performing a task.

126
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
It's too hard.

127
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,040
Because we are having secret love.

128
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
I think it quite good.

129
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,360
We're different from others.

130
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
We're special.

131
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,360
Is it good?

132
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,480
What flavor?

133
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,000
Perhaps peach.

134
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,960
Is there a peach filling for rice cakes?

135
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,320
Your hand smells like peach.

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
It's because I used peach flavor hand cream.

137
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
It smells good.

138
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,440
Let's go.

139
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,440
Let's join the others.

140
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,600
Okay.

141
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,360
We should go separately.

142
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,960
Why?

143
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,200
If we disappear together and appear together again,

144
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,520
doesn't it show obviously

145
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,880
that we were together?

146
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,280
You first.

147
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,400
I'll go later.

148
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920
Where have you been?

149
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,760
Qin, we've waited for you for long.

150
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,480
Where were you?

151
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,560
It's been half a century.

152
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,560
Right.

153
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,720
Yuan Qian.

154
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,560
Yuan Qian, where have you been?

155
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,120
It's a small world.

156
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,160
I chatted with my friend

157
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
from middle school a whole afternoon.

158
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
So tiring.

159
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,040
You should have told her you were busy.

160
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,760
You should have told her you came here with us.

161
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Either you got lost, or ran into a friend.

162
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,520
And this guy

163
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,080
was synchronized with you.

164
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,920
I know he is too simple to be a good liar,

165
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,640
or I would think they got lost deliberately.

166
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,840
Silly simple boy.

167
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
Qin Shen.

168
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,040
Yuan Qian, you're here also.

169
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

170
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,120
Two dormitories came together.

171
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,000
Theoretically, we came to play.

172
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,600
Factually, we came here to find them.

173
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,280
They kept getting lost,

174
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,040
and we kept looking for them.

175
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,720
It's really crowded here.

176
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,360
You are here for fun too?

177
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,480
You haven't gone back?

178
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,400
How about join us?

179
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,480
No, thank you. Our hotel is just over there.

180
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Where do you live?

181
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,520
The youth hostel over there.

182
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,520
Let's go.

183
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,360
Bye.

184
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,640
Bye.

185
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,240
Yuan Qian, let's go.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,480
Stay safe.

187
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,520
We'll be off.

188
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,240
Bye bye.

189
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,360
Bye bye.

190
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,720
Let's go. Hurry up.

191
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,880
The world is so big,

192
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,680
but we met Ling Wei here.

193
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,680
Isn't it fate, Qin?

194
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,160
What's our plan for tomorrow?

195
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,960
People like you who get lost all the time

196
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
don't need any plan.

197
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,280
Free time tomorrow.

198
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,520
Qin,

199
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,400
why do you always want the free time?

200
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,800
What do you want to do?

201
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,880
Someone is so noisy.

202
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm cheering up the team, okay?

203
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,720
Why didn't you back my proposal of free time?

204
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,600
If only we two say yes,

205
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,200
it's almost the same as

206
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,040
admitting we're seeing each other.

207
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,520
OK.

208
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,720
Don't reply.

209
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm with my roommate.

210
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,040
Who are you texting to

211
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,160
cuddling with your phone?

212
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,720
You don't want Luo Xinxin

213
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,640
to see your phone so you come out with me, right?

214
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm chatting with an online shop owner.

215
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,120
I've just bought

216
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,280
a pair of shoes.

217
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,120
A pair of shoes?

218
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,160
Look. Why are they here?

219
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
Yuan Qian,

220
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
didn't you come back very early?

221
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,920
Why aren't you in your rooms?

222
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
We are going to buy eye drops.

223
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,800
Is something wrong with your eyes?

224
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,920
By the way,

225
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,360
we've moved to this hostel.

226
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,280
I feel safe

227
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
if we stay in a same hostel.

228
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,400
I don't think you come for us.

229
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,200
You come for somebody among us.

230
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,120
Don't get me wrong.

231
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,120
Let's go.

232
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,040
Go for eye drops.

233
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,400
What did Lu Jianing mean?

234
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
It's none of her business.

235
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,960
She makes me sick.

236
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,920
Let's go.

237
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,560
Tell you what,

238
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
Ling Wei

239
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
has an axe to grind.

240
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,240
She has a dog nose that can smells Qin Shen from far away.

241
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,520
You!

242
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,200
You stopped me and even kicked me.

243
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,520
Ling Wei kicked you?

244
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,000
I kicked her.

245
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,200
If I hadn't kicked her,

246
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,720
she would begin to swear the next second.

247
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,000
If you fight,

248
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,920
I'm not able to stop you.

249
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,000
Ling Wei moved into our hostel.

250
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,880
Does she wear a radar of searching for Qin Shen.

251
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,960
She goes everywhere Qin Shen goes.

252
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,120
It's obvious that she doesn't want to give up on him.

253
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,240
That's right.

254
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,920
What's Ling Wei's strategy?

255
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,760
She said she gave up,

256
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,240
however, her moves proved the opposite.

257
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
Anyone who has a relationship with Qin Shen

258
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,960
must keep alert so as not to be deceived.

259
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,520
Do you think so, Yuan Qian?

260
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,920
Why do you ask me?

261
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,440
By the way, Yuan Qian.

262
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,320
When you got lost,

263
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Qin Shen got lost too.

264
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,760
Isn't it too coincidental?

265
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,600
Yes, what a coincidence!

266
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,960
Stop playing dumb.

267
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,960
There isn't any extreme coincidence,

268
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,280
but planned actions.

269
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,680
Tell us honestly.

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,760
Are you seeing Qin Shen secretly?

271
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,160
Tell you what!

272
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,040
I need to dry the damp towel in my bag.

273
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,400
I'll hang it up.

274
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
We also have a damp towel to hang up.

275
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,880
Let's go. Hang up the towel.

276
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,040
I'll take my bath.

277
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,040
Terrible.

278
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920
There are risks everywhere.

279
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,120
What?

280
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,320
Nothing.

281
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,560
I just want to experience

282
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
a tryst of Romeo and Juliet on a balcony.

283
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,080
Stay with me.

284
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,320
Don't you have your buddies?

285
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,280
I'm not interested in them.

286
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,480
What are you looking at?

287
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Looking at my boyfriend.

288
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,720
I ran into Ling Wei when I went downstairs.

289
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,080
What on earth is your magic

290
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,200
making her so obsessed with you?

291
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,120
I'm handsome.

292
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Come on!

293
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,280
Yuan... Yuan Qian.

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,120
Ling Wei.

295
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,720
You live next door?

296
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,200
Yes, what a coincidence.

297
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,280
What are you doing?

298
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm collecting my laundry.

299
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,480
My towel.

300
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,080
Towel.

301
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,720
Chen Qinan, are you rushing to start a new soul?

302
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,360
You woke us up so early.

303
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,120
You don't know

304
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,920
how late we went to bed last night!

305
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,440
Luo Xinxin, you're fat because you're lazy.

306
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,640
You need to move.

307
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,120
Shut up!

308
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,760
If I travel again with you in the future,

309
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,120
I'll be a pig.

310
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,160
You're already a pig.

311
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,080
Chen Qinan!

312
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,880
You'd better have a plan that can satisfy me.

313
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,400
I've heard there will be games around around.

314
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,080
And you can get prizes

315
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,200
if you win it.

316
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,160
These can satisfy

317
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,480
your demand for free time.

318
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,320
Prizes? Qin Shen is here.

319
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,800
You have no hope to get any prizes.

320
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,120
Well. Well. Don't waste time.

321
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,440
Let's get going.

322
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,560
Let's go.

323
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,800
Keep away from me.

324
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,080
Wei, how do you say we go to the old town?

325
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,640
We just visited half of it yesterday.

326
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,080
Old towns are all the same.

327
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,840
I've searched about another site online.

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,960
Let's go there.

329
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,920
We agreed to finish the other half.

330
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
And there are movie studios,

331
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,160
may be we can meet some actors or actresses.

332
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,360
Shall we go there tomorrow?

333
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,200
Well, okay.

334
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,800
I'll go anywhere with you.

335
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,240
Let's go.

336
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,200
Okay.

337
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,920
Dear guests,

338
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,560
good afternoon!

339
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Good afternoon!

340
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,240
Well.

341
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
Yuan Qian, Yuan Qian.

342
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,800
Is there a game?

343
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,560
Show mercy on me!

344
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,480
There must be a game.

345
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,440
Chen Qinan, you are taller than us.

346
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Have a look at it.

347
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,920
Now you need me?

348
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,800
Little fatty.

349
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,560
My dear fiends,

350
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,480
please raise your hands if you want a gift.

351
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
Me!

352
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,440
I see it.

353
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,040
It's a prize-winning game.

354
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,720
The champion can win a phone.

355
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,520
Two people in one group.

356
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,200
A boy and a girl.

357
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,800
Isn't it a game for lovers?

358
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,440
The girl is part of it.

359
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,640
I won't...

360
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,120
Come on, baby.

361
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
The boy holds the girl in his arms.

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,040
The team who arrives

363
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,840
at the destination first wins.

364
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,880
Okay?

365
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
You'll participate in it also?

366
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,880
Okay. Okay.

367
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,160
Qin Shen, and Yuan Qian.

368
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,400
Are you excited?

369
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,560
I'll quit.

370
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,680
I'll look after your bags.

371
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,560
Don't be a spoilsport

372
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,240
Yuan Qian,

373
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,080
Are you interested in it?

374
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000
See you.

375
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,520
See you.

376
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,440
Okay.

377
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,520
He ran to her.

378
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,000
Since you're so interested in it,

379
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,000
so then,

380
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,760
we'll...

381
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,640
I've signed up.

382
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,960
Don't be silly before so many people.

383
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,800
Don't be so cruel on them.

384
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,600
We can choose another good date to let them know.

385
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,000
It's a good date today.

386
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,640
How about you stay and look after the bags with me?

387
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,680
Anyway, we can still be alone.

388
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,240
Just with a couple of bags.

389
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,360
Okay, you two.

390
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,040
Yes. Yes. You!

391
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,000
Come on.

392
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,000
Yuan Qian, what a coincidence.

393
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,680
You come here also?

394
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,080
There's a game over there.

395
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,480
Let's have a look?

396
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,280
Let's go.

397
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,120
I have to look after bags.

398
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,680
Okay.

399
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,480
Go!

400
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,440
The first group has gone all-out.

401
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
Go! Go! Go!

402
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,760
Let's go.

403
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,040
Hurry up!

404
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,240
It's a pity.

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,320
How about I stay also to look after the bags?

406
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,240
There're so many bags.

407
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,120
It'll be hard for Yuan Qian alone to keep an eye on them.

408
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,760
Okay.

409
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,040
Go for it.

410
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,440
Please go to the stand to get your prizes from my colleague.

411
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,440
The game just now was really wonderful.

412
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,520
Now, two more groups

413
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
for another game.

414
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,760
But it'll be more difficult.

415
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,880
After the they arrive at the destination,

416
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,800
they need to finish another step.

417
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,840
Ling Wei is perfect,

418
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
except that she is too single-minded.

419
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,640
She puts all the apples in one basket.

420
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,440
She got depression because of him.

421
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,880
Why is Qin Shen so popular

422
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,400
with so many pursuers?

423
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,960
Ling Wei's depression gets more serious?

424
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,200
It's fine.

425
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,800
It was serious at the beginning of last term.

426
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,560
She went out and socialized a lot

427
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,880
so she got happier.

428
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,600
She's fine now and has stopped taking medicines.

429
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,040
Stop taking medicines?

430
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,400
Since when?

431
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,680
Middle of the last term.

432
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,280
Ling Wei, are you sick?

433
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,480
Has there been a recurrence?

434
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,840
What do you mean?

435
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,760
Do you expect her to get sick again?

436
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,480
No. No. No.

437
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,120
I, I don't mean that.

438
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm just worried about her.

439
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,040
I thank you for her.

440
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
She's fine now.

441
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,880
Very healthy.

442
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,240
Well, you stay here.

443
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,320
I want to walk around and I'll be back soon.

444
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,960
Go! Go! Go!

445
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,200
Awesome!

446
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,640
She must work out often.

447
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,480
Go! Go! Go!

448
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,720
Yuan Qian.

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,080
Yuan Qian.

450
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,920
It's so hard to walk on such a road.

451
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
Give them to me.

452
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,520
It seems Qin Shen and Ling Wei

453
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
will play the game.

454
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,440
The game should play in pairs.

455
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
They are in a group?

456
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,240
Does Ling Wei want to be with Qin Shen?

457
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Or Qin Shen wants to be with Ling Wei?

458
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,160
Any difference?

459
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,160
No.

460
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,960
So will you go and watch it?

461
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,240
Of course not.

462
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,800
I would rather enjoy the scenery than watching their game.

463
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,320
Okay, now,

464
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,520
welcome the three teams of our next game.

465
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,120
Let's give it up to them.

466
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,560
Great!

467
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,320
OK. Please tell us

468
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,960
who your partner is.

469
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
Qin Shen and Chen Qinan.

470
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,320
Buddy,

471
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,400
the rule said a team should have one girl and one boy.

472
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,080
Rules can be changed.

473
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,960
I prefer two boys.

474
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,640
My God.

475
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
You really surprised me.

476
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Don't be shy.

477
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,680
We are already here.

478
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,600
Sorry.

479
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,840
I wanted you to be in a group.

480
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,040
It's fine. Go for it.

481
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,520
Well, now,

482
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,040
listen up, everyone.

483
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,280
The game we're going to play

484
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,200
is called

485
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,040
“Pictionary”.

486
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,360
Here is the rule...

487
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,760
We can easily make it.

488
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,920
"Pictionary" is a piece of cake

489
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,960
for us sculpture students.

490
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,200
First get the answer, wins!

491
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,360
Okay. Contestants.

492
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Are you ready?

493
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,040
Yes!

494
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,960
We can do it.

495
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,600
Go! Go! Go!

496
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,080
Now, please.

497
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,240
The first one.

498
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,480
Everyone.

499
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,360
Let's cheer and applaud for them!

500
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,040
Great!

501
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,760
Go! Go! Go!

502
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,320
OK. Here is our

503
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,080
first question!

504
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,600
Marathon
first question!

505
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,140
Marathon

506
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,160
How to draw it?

507
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,960
Starting now!

508
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,080
What's Chen Qinan drawing?

509
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,200
He wants to be creative within tens of seconds?

510
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
What is it? A donkey?

511
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,040
I feel sorry for our Qin.

512
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,440
Count down from 5 seconds.

513
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,600
5.

514
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,080
4. 3. 2.1.

515
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,660
"Marathon" is "马(horse)拉(pull)松(pine)" in Chinese.

516
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,000
Marathon.

517
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,600
Yes!

518
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
Congratulations! You got the right answer.

519
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,240
That's

520
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,080
unbelievable.

521
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,800
The players of the first round

522
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,640
are all really awesome.

523
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,360
Now

524
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,490
let's see which team

525
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,800
Abalone
let's see which team

526
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,560
let's see which team

527
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,400
will win the next round.

528
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,160
Okay, starting now.

529
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,880
Chen Qinan's drawing sucks.

530
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,520
Does he really major in arts?

531
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,640
I doubt it.

532
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,600
Countdown from 5.

533
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,480
5. 4. 3. 2. 1.

534
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,590
"Abalone" is "鲍(hug)鱼(fish)" in Chinese.

535
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,520
Abalone.

536
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,680
- It works? - Correct!

537
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,080
This is awesome.

538
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
Yeah. They are so in sync!

539
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,240
In fact Chen Qinan does nothing.

540
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,840
It's all because Qin is great.

541
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
You still know it's

542
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,840
the right thing to do to pay tribute to your girlfriend?

543
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm surprised that you still remember you're my girlfriend.

544
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,000
Of course, I know.

545
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,960
Anyway.

546
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,760
I won't play lover games with other boys.

547
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,800
What's this shit?

548
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,520
Fresh lemonade.

549
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,680
Qin Shen, are you revenging on me?

550
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,960
There are honey in it.

551
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,040
It's too hot.

552
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,840
Lemonade can cool you off.

553
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,320
I'm leaving.

554
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,160
If all goes well,

555
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,840
our team can get the first place.

556
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
As long we can win the game of "carrying the girl in arms".

557
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,000
Carrying in arms?

558
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,640
Great!

559
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,960
Kiss her!

560
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,880
Is something wrong with me?

561
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,360
Why don't I join the game

562
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,280
since I have such an excellent boyfriend?

563
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,040
I should be the champion's girl.

564
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,720
The one in his arms should be me,

565
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,920
Yuan Qian!

566
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
I can't believe Qin took me to play the game

567
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
and won the phone!

568
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,520
It's a latest model.

569
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,280
And he gave it to me without any hesitation.

570
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,560
I don't even need to pay for it.

571
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,520
Look how much we love each other.

572
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,080
It's hurting my eyes.

573
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,040
He worked so hard

574
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,720
but didn't get anything?

575
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,840
Yes, he did.

576
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,680
He got a cheap necklace.

577
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,640
There's nothing on it except it's inscribed

578
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,880
"eternal first love".

579
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,840
It's not special at all.

580
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,080
Yuan Qian.

581
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,600
What are you doing here?

583
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,800
Do you have a secret?

584
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,360
Being your boyfriend is my biggest secret.

585
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,480
Just now I searched on my phone.

586
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,040
It's really a good date today.

587
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,520
Look.

588
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,440
It must be a good date today,

589
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,520
because you won the game.

590
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,840
So what prizes do you get?

591
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,960
I gave the prize to Chen Qinan.

592
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,280
All of them?

593
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,960
I didn't play for prizes.

594
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,200
Do you mean it?

595
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,800
You.

596
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,560
You gave it to Luo Xinxin?

597
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,320
Why?

598
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,040
He asked for it.

599
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,720
Don't... Don't you know it's an important thing?

600
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,280
She said she liked it

601
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,480
and asked me for it.

602
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,720
So you gave it to her?

603
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,280
Enjoy yourself.

604
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,960
Yuan Qian.

605
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,840
I'll show you something good.

606
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,160
What?

607
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,360
Look.

608
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,080
Look. Are they beautiful?

609
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,680
What're they?

610
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,760
I found them on the beach.

611
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,560
Look. Doesn't it have a beautiful pattern?

612
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Where's the necklace?

613
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,840
What necklace?

614
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,880
The...

615
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,480
The necklace in this box.

616
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,600
No.

617
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,680
I like the box,

618
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,000
so I asked Qin Shen to give it to me.

619
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
You think

620
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,560
Qin Shen gave the necklace to me?

621
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,920
It's impossible.

622
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,240
It's your necklace.

623
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,520
I'll be off.

624
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,360
Bye.

625
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,160
You're not angry anymore?

626
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,880
I wasn't angry.

627
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,760
Why should I be angry?

628
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,400
Lost your memory?

629
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,480
Mr. Qin Shen,

630
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,440
I find you vindictive.

631
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,240
You did everything on purpose to get me mad, right?

632
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
You're not an total idiot.

633
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
You got a tongue like a razor.

634
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,680
Don't you remember

635
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,000
who hurt me with the razor first?

636
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,560
Sorry.

637
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,120
It was thoughtless of me.

638
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,760
I've been caring about people around me,

639
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,440
but I wasn't that caring about you.

640
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,160
I shouldn't have asked you

641
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,520
to compromise yourself.

642
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,120
I'll let them know about us when we're back.

643
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,760
Are you sure?

644
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,240
That's all you can do?

645
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,960
That's...

646
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,520
That's not enough?

647
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,080
Far from enough.

648
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,040
What do you want me to do?

649
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,320
Think yourself.

650
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,200
Come closer.
