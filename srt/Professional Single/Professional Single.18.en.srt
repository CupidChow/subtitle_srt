1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,000
Professional Single

2
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,880
I always found that

4
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,400
they were sitting closely

5
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,080
in the last row of the study lounge

6
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
when I went to the library.

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
Qin Shen even used her cup to drink!

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,920
Do you think it is normal?

9
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Ling Wei.

10
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
What a coconut!

11
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm looking for some documents.

12
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,640
Why is Qi Shen helping you

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,240
with the illustration for my father's school?

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,560
You two have been stayed together.

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Are you dating?

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No.

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,960
We are...

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Yes.

19
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,840
She paid me to help her.

20
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,480
That's great.

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,440
My father must be very happy

22
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
to have so many talents to help.

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,680
I will leave you alone.

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
See ya.

25
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,760
So the underground romance is not because of Song Siyi,

26
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
but for Ling Wei?

27
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
It is really complicated.

28
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,600
Ling Wei's not in a good health condition.

29
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,560
I am afraid that when she knows this,

30
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,840
her condition would get worse.

31
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,080
Then I will feel guilty for that.

32
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't want to stimulate her

33
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
so you stimulate me.

34
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
That's different.

35
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,600
We're closer.

36
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,160
Underground romance.

37
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Intern boyfriend.

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
It seems you got it right.

39
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
I warn you.

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,000
You'd better give me the status I deserved.

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,200
There's a time limit.

42
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,360
You need give me some time

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
to get clear with all these stuff.

44
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
When?

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
In one day.

46
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
That's too short.

47
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
In half a day.

48
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,280
Qin Shen,

49
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
how can you be so unreasonable?

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Then the unreasonable one is leaving.

51
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,640
No. We can negotiate it, come on.

52
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,640
You want a name.

53
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
I will give you! I will!

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
When?

55
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
ASAP.

56
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I sure will make it soon.

57
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,080
Can you have a look on my work?

58
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,520
I always find it weird.

59
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
No.

60
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,840
Never mind.

61
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,800
I will ask Jia Sicheng to check it.

62
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
What?

63
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,880
Art is of self-awareness.

64
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,760
You can't always count on others' guidance and suggestions.

65
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,560
You are not mad at me?

66
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
No.

67
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,360
I just want to tell you

68
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,360
don't turn private creations into a work of a group.

69
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
That's not art.

70
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Well,

71
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,120
I am not going to have meals with them.

72
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,520
Let's go and have Spicy Hot Pot.

73
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,400
We are of underground romance.

74
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
We should be careful.

75
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
Chopsticks, chopsticks.

76
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,559
Here you are.

77
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Let's go.

78
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,045
There's no queue at that window.

79
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Qin Shen.

80
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
You're having meal alone?

81
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,880
Swipe your card, your card.

82
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,040
Qin Shen.

83
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,640
Why are you alone today?

84
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,080
Where's Chen Qinan and others?

85
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
They are busy.

86
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,560
Yuan, Yuan Qian.

87
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,400
Are you crazy?

88
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,320
Why did you swipe your card three times?

89
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,760
Please stay normal, okay?

90
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
How about me buy you some ginkgo pills

91
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
for your brain?

92
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,640
I have found the seat, I'll go now.

93
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,440
Auntie, hurry please.

94
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Come on.

95
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,080
Wait me, Yuan Qian!

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
Zhang Mengjie, Qin Shen.

97
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
You're having meals here, too.

98
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,525
What a coincidence!

99
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Let's eat together.

100
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,320
Qin Shen.

101
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,880
Do you usually eat in the canteen?

102
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
If he doesn't eat here,

103
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,800
he eats in the heaven?

104
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,760
I don't mean that.

105
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
I mean

106
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
do you go to the commercial street for meals?

107
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Qin Shen,

108
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,200
are you from Xuanzhou?

109
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,994
You've been classmates for long,

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,171
but you don't know where he comes from.

111
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,240
Are you Qin Shen?

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,040
I don't have such a great name.

113
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Isn't it the time to public our relationship?

114
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,720
Do you want others to cast greedy eyes on me?

115
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Luo Xinxin,

116
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,520
I have something urgent.

117
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
I should leave.

118
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,640
But I haven't finished yet.

119
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
Don't you want to lose weight?

120
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Let's go.

121
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,080
Come on.

122
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Help yourself, I am leaving.

123
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,360
You are furious.

124
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,600
I doubt if we don't leave on time,

125
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
you'll chop off the head

126
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
of that girl.

127
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
I don't care about her.

128
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,160
Even you are jealous,

129
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,600
can you leave these innocents alone?

130
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Okay?

131
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Wait a minute.

132
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,080
You've always told us before

133
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
that you wouldn't like Qin Shen.

134
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Why do you suddenly

135
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,600
fall in love with him?

136
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,280
I did nothing.

137
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I am not jealous.

138
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
You swiped card for three times because you were hungry.

139
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,320
You sit there because there was no other place.

140
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,760
You answered questions for him

141
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,160
because you were his girl...

142
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
female secretary.

143
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,440
Hello.

144
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,200
Are you mad at me?

145
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Mom,

146
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,160
I am in the dormitory.

147
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm back in dorm after meal.

148
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,360
I am happy today.

149
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Don't worry about me.

150
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,217
Is there anyone beside you?

151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I know.

152
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,600
You two take care of yourselves.

153
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,160
If you don't entitle me,

154
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,360
I'm not sure how long I can stand.

155
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Okay, okay.

156
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
I know.

157
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,080
I will call you soon.

158
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,280
Why are you like a griveing woman?

159
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
It's enough.

160
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,080
Bye.

161
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Bye bye.

162
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,880
If I can't have my name,

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,360
I will always be a grieving woman.

164
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,400
Okay, okay, okay.

165
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,268
There will be a period of time before the holiday.

166
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,880
I will come home in the holiday.

167
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,634
Let's go to the cinema on the weekend.

168
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,360
If you don't come,

169
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I will tell Chen Qinan.

170
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Chen Qinan!

171
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,520
What?

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, okay, okay.

173
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
I will go!

174
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,360
In the Spring Festival, I will go to uncle's home.

175
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
What?

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,200
Nothing.

177
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Okay.

178
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,800
I am taking a shower now.

179
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,222
I really haven't expected that.

180
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
What?

181
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,200
You are such a guy

182
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,600
to threaten me out to see a movie.

183
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,280
If it works, then it is a good method.

184
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,200
This is my new phone case.

185
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,200
Is it beautiful?

186
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
If you like it, I will buy you one.

187
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,400
Can you hold the phone with another hand?

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Any differences?

189
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,800
Girls who learn sculpture

190
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,200
are absolutely with rough hands.

191
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,480
Which girl's delicate hand have you touched?

192
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
My mom.

193
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,760
I also think like that.

194
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,640
You choose firt. Okay.

195
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,440
Whatever you like.

196
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,880
Yes, the last one we went.

197
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Wait for me!

198
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,200
Here is your ticket.

199
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Thank you.

200
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,880
Hello, I want to take my tickets.

201
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Okay.

202
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,480
Thank you.

203
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
You're welcome.

204
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,560
Is the film Ugly Doll?

205
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Two Ugly Doll.

206
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,880
It seems like we have similar tastes.

207
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,400
Cartoons can clean and purify the soul.

208
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
Which line did you reserve?

209
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
L,

210
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
that movie has a good reputation.

211
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,720
Each role is adorable.

212
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
It's very interesting.

213
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,520
Are you mad

214
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,920
just because I shaked off your hand?

215
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,920
Don't be.

216
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,788
I think we can't be too close in the public

217
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,200
because of my single sequelae.

218
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,760
That's my instinct.

219
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,880
It's dark in the cinema.

220
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,640
You can do anything you want.

221
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,240
Hello.

222
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,200
Two cups of cola and one box of popcorn.

223
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
It's here.

224
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,000
No, you take the wrong seat.

225
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,920
My seat is No.1. It's at the end of the row.

226
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Come on.

227
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,440
Seat 17...

228
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,680
Did you get the wrong ticket?

229
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
No.

230
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
What do you mean?

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,440
We can't be too close in public.

232
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,440
Be careful.

233
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Sorry, sorry.

234
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,720
How can a couple sit so far from each other

235
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
when they watch a movie together?

236
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,360
I know I was wrong.

237
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,440
I won't shake off your hand anymore.

238
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Okay?

239
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,120
That's my instinct.

240
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,480
If you don't pay attention to me, I will play tricks.

241
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,880
Handsome Qin Shen,

242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
I really know I was wrong.

243
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,880
Please forgive me this time.

244
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,280
We are true love.

245
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
We can't fight with each other for this.

246
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,840
Please forgive me.

247
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,400
Please respect the work of film workers.

248
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
I...

249
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,200
I thought that bro was my classmate.

250
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
We don't have a friend with yellow hair.

251
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Really?

252
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,200
Can you be normal?

253
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,640
During the day you are fine.

254
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,800
Why are you treat me like this now?

255
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,240
This is the underground romance.

256
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,800
I am used to it.

257
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,560
I hope you, the one who suggested this,

258
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,280
will get used to it soon.

259
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,440
Are you doing this on purpose?

260
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,600
Yes, of course.

261
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,800
Narrow-minded.

262
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,440
A grieving woman!

263
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
I just want to punish you a little bit

264
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
to show how great a grieving woman can be.

265
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,400
I will get used to hold hands.

266
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,880
So we will sit together when we watch films.

267
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,600
It's time to hand in.

268
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,680
Cheer up! We are here with you.

269
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
I...

270
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
I am a little bit scared.

271
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,840
We all believe in you.

272
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,640
There's no problem.

273
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,880
- Let's go.
- Come on!

274
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,851
If you dare not to check it,

275
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,960
then we will accompany you.

276
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Step by step.

277
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay, the last step!

278
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,720
One.

279
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Two.

280
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Three.

281
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,360
Here.

282
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
Here.

283
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,480
You did!

284
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
Yuan Qian.

285
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I want a hug.

286
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Yuan Qian.

287
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,440
You pass the exam

288
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
and you are on the first place.

289
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,560
You must

290
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,920
treat us a meal!

291
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,280
Yes! A big meal!

292
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Big meal!

293
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,760
What do you want to eat?

294
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Hot pot!

295
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,960
I want BBQ.

296
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Don't go to BBQ.

297
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,160
Hello, Yuan Qian.

298
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,960
Come to my office now.

299
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
Okay, I'll go now.

300
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,120
Yuan Qian.

301
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
What about our meal?

302
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Fine, let's go to canteen.

303
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's go.

304
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
She can't escape this.

305
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Yes.

306
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Teacher.

307
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Yuan Qian, come in.

308
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,720
Congratulations.

309
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
You are number one.

310
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Thank you, teacher.

311
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,560
I heard that you've recommended me

312
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,988
to the dean of Oil Painting Department.

313
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,480
I happened to encouter him

314
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
so I told him that

315
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,840
you had talent in the art of

316
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,080
both sculpture and oil painting.

317
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,040
You could handle them all.

318
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,400
I bragged about you a lot.

319
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,960
Teacher,

320
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
do you blame me?

321
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,360
I waste a lot of opportunities and resource.

322
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Yuan Qian,

323
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,600
I

324
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,000
really like you.

325
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,240
You effort and your design

326
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
are shown in your work.

327
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,360
When you told me you wanted to transfer,

328
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
I was really sad.

329
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,080
But later I thought

330
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,240
I needed to respect your wishes.

331
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Teacher.

332
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
If you stick on your own way for art,

333
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,708
no matter which department you choose,

334
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,080
I am always your teacher.

335
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Thank you, teacher.

336
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,000
You got number one.

337
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,560
And your dream came true.

338
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,120
Why are you unhappy?

339
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,840
Congratulations for your passing.

340
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
You don't like it?

341
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Today the supervisor and dean of Oil Painting department

342
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
have talked to me.

343
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,240
About transferring?

344
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
More than that.

345
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,800
They also told me that

346
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,400
Prof. Jin recommended me

347
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,165
to the dean especially.

348
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
That's good.

349
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm wondering

350
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,840
if my choice is right.

351
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,560
Emotionally,

352
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,040
I want you to stay in sculpture department.

353
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
I know.

354
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,160
But I wish

355
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,280
you can make the choice following your heart

356
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,400
and choose a major you like.

357
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,680
When I was a child, I liked oil painting.

358
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,400
My goal has always been oil painting.

359
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,440
I just entered the sculpture department accidentally.

360
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,280
But my teachers, my classmates

361
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,520
and even sculpture itself

362
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,480
made me fell in love with the major.

363
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,400
Oil painting is your dream.

364
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,680
And you have gift in the sculpture.

365
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Really?

366
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,560
No matter which way you choose,

367
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,720
I will always support you.

368
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Thank you.

369
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,760
The three-day's holiday is coming.

370
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,440
Do you have any arrangements?

371
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,680
No, I've just finished the exams.

372
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,760
I don't have time to think about that.

373
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,120
You can relax be this chance.

374
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,680
Many people may travel in the holiday.

375
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,680
My roommate's back. I will talk with you later.

376
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
When you...

377
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,680
Qin.

378
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,040
I heard there'll be lantern shows in Xuanzhou heritage town.

379
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,680
I think we can go together.

380
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Will you come with me?

381
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
No.

382
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I know that.

383
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
What about you?

384
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,560
Can you just give up these activities?

385
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,000
Come to gym with me.

386
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,320
Be my gym friend.

387
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Gym friend, not gay friend!

388
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
I also invite

389
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,800
girls!

390
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,840
I am not interested in others girls.

391
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,960
I know.

392
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,480
So I invite Luo Xinxin and her roommates.

393
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Now I know

394
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,160
Luo Xinxin and Xue Congyang will come with us.

395
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm in!

396
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
I'm in!

397
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
The other two are still thinking about it.

398
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,560
Qin, think twice please.

399
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Qin Shen

400
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,920
won't come with us.

401
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
I just asked him

402
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,280
to show my polite.

403
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,080
Reasonable.

404
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Reasonable.

405
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
I am not sure.

406
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,760
What did I hear?

407
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,600
Qin Shen didn't refuse me directly!

408
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
You got it right.

409
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
No.

410
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Yes! Yes!

411
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,817
Of course you can go with us!

412
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Hello.

413
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,520
Do you want to go to the lantern show?

414
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
They say it is a hundred-year ancient town in Xuanzhou.

415
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,960
It should be fun.

416
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,320
Will you go with me

417
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,880
or go with a group?

418
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,320
It will be funny to go with our friends.

419
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Really?

420
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
If they all go,

421
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
and I say no,

422
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,920
they must think it is weird.

423
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760
If they find our secret,

424
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
that will be a disaster.

425
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,640
You are quibbling.

426
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,120
Take it easy, we can make it step by step.

427
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,080
At first we go with friends,

428
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,000
then we can go alone

429
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,760
by ourselves.

430
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Right?

431
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
This time I'll let you go.

432
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Thank you.

433
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,560
You are really a gentleman.

434
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,280
My shoelaces are loose, I wanna tie them now.

435
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
You go first.

436
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Okay.

437
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
The first row.

438
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,920
Chen Qinan, take the seat behind.

439
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,400
Qian have motion sickness, let her sit here.

440
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,640
Okay.

441
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,160
It's okay.

442
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,760
I want to sit here.

443
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
The first row is more comfortable.

444
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,520
Okay.

445
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,160
Now I'll distribute you food.

446
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,960
Come on!

447
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
I want potato chips.

448
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
What do you want?

449
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
This, this.

450
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Are you sure?

451
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
Come on.

452
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Qianqian,

453
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,080
here are your snacks.

454
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,022
If you want to sleep, you can lean against my shoulder.

455
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
In this short holiday,

456
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,200
if we have boyfriends or girlfriends,

457
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,200
it would be nice to travel with them.

458
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,920
What?

459
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,160
Don't you want to travel with us?

460
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,520
Pig can't match with a girlfriend!

461
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,320
Right!

462
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Men all know it.

463
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Disgusting.

464
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,680
I was also transferred to the Sculpture Department.

465
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,360
Okay?

466
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
At that time I thought

467
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,320
human and ghost still can't be apart.

468
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,680
This is far-sighted.

469
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,160
That is about pottery, okay?

470
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
So what?

471
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,760
They all means to play with muds.

472
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,560
You are always single.

473
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Leftover boy.

474
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,400
We are all bachelors.

475
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,560
Actually, someone never gets into relationship,

476
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,000
but it dosen't seem that he can't be in a relationship.

477
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,080
Many people like him,

478
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,440
but he doesn't like them.

479
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
For example,

480
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,440
Qin Shen.

481
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,040
Yuan Qian,

482
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,360
there are a lot of yummy food!

483
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,800
Crazy potato! Spicy and sour noodle!

484
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Stewed bread with shallot!

485
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,240
- Persimmon!
- Potato!

486
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,840
What's the red one?

487
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,514
Luo Xinxin.

488
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:03,120
Sugar-coated haws?

489
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,080
You can only see food, right?

490
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,440
Shut up!

491
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,640
That's beautiful!

492
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,240
They all wear Hanbiuk!

493
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,080
Yes!

494
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,960
Is that Hanbiuk show?

495
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,800
Let's rent Hanbiuk to wear!

496
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,520
Come on!

497
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
I think it may fits.

498
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,880
You say,

499
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,760
is there any Hanbiuk that fits Luo Xinxin?

500
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,040
No.

501
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,080
I agree.

502
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Hurry up!

503
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,960
I want a loose one.

504
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,440
This is too small.

505
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,960
If I wear it, it must look very fat.

506
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,600
This is good.

507
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,880
This matches with my lips.

508
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,040
Really!

509
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Try it on.

510
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Okay.

511
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,000
Xuexue,

512
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,960
you study a lot about Hanbiuk, right?

513
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,360
Can you choose them for us?

514
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,480
Okay.

515
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,120
Yuan Qian, this is yours.

516
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,280
Jianing,

517
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,640
this is yours.

518
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,760
I've checked them for you,

519
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,760
these two suits

520
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,840
fit your skins and characters most.

521
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Try them on!

522
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
Come on.

523
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,880
Let's go, Yuan Qian.

524
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
How about this?

525
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,400
- This is good!
- It's wonderful!

526
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Okay.

527
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,680
I like this.

528
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,440
I wonder how Chen Qinan and Yi Ming

529
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
will look like.

530
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
It should be very funny.

531
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,960
It's rare that they're willing to put them on!

532
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,920
Yes!

533
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,760
Qin Shen may not even wear it.

534
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,280
Please tie this for me.

535
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Okay.

536
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Qin Shen.

537
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,520
You really wear it!

538
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,320
Sometimes I should have a taste of ordinary life.

539
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,640
You are handsome!

540
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
You too!

541
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,120
Yours is beautiful.

542
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,680
I want to see Xinxin.

543
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,360
Xinxin!

544
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,760
- Here!
- Xinxin!

545
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
None of your business.

546
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,160
Your cloth is cute!

547
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
It's really adorable!

548
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,840
Yours are cute, too!

549
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Look! I choose it by myself!

550
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,200
Yuan Qian, there is a shop selling hairpins.

551
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Let's go and have a look!

552
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,440
Yuan Qian, what are you doing?

553
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Nothing.

554
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,440
I just felt very hot!

555
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Go away!

556
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,800
What's wrong?

557
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
What are you doing?

558
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,960
Today is a little bit muggy.

559
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
You cloth

560
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,480
is very cute!

561
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Come on!

562
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,240
So many people here!

563
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,800
When I was searching information,

564
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,742
I found there'll be a performance on carrying sedan chair .

565
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,160
And we just encountered it!

566
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,920
We are so lucky!

567
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,880
Yes!

568
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I like to watch this!

569
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Let's go!

570
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,680
Luo Xinxin,

571
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,480
you just can watch it.

572
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,160
You can't sit on that chair!

573
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
They can't stand her weight!

574
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
I will kill you!

575
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,240
Are you taking me out to do sports?

576
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,880
Your hand is sweating.

577
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,000
It's yours.

578
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
I didn't.

579
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Yuan Qian,

580
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,520
Qin Shen, where are you going?

581
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,880
We have been looking for you.

582
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,200
Why are you coming from the opposite side?

583
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
I think the road of the town is in a circle.

584
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,320
Yes, yes, yes.

585
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,800
I just got lost and couldn't find my way.

586
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I happened to find her

587
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,080
and follow her.

588
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,960
Yuan Qian,

589
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,480
you really have no sense of direction!

590
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,320
Fortunately, you came across Qin Shen,

591
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,840
otherwise we will lose you.

592
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Okay, that's okay.

593
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,280
It's good you're just fine.

594
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,240
Yuan Qian, follow us.

595
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,840
What if you come across with bad guys?

596
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,920
Okay, I will follow you.

597
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,845
- Let's go.
- Hold my hand.

598
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Hand.

599
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,680
Tell me.

600
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
- What's up?
- What did you meet?
