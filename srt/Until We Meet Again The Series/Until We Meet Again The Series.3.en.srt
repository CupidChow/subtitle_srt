1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,110
Sorry, guys. Did you wait too long?

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,910
Not too long.

4
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,490
What did the teacher say?

5
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,410
Almost failed.

6
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,990
It's too difficult.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,410
What's difficult?

8
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,390
I told you to submit the work early.

9
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,400
Well, stop lecturing!

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,900
The teacher told me to give you this.

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,690
You almost failed as well.

12
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,990
At least I submitted three days early.

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,910
And...

14
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,790
The teacher also gave me this.

15
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,280
It's In's work.

16
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,800
He was the first person
to submit the work.

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,990
In was smart.

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,490
He got an A+.

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,910
He was smart.

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,990
He was really smart.

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,020
He wanted to get a
first-class honours degree.

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,060
He said he wanted to
make his parents proud.

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,490
I can't believe it.

24
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,300
I don't have a chance to see him anymore.

25
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,290
This hurts, man.

26
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,490
He's my best friend.

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,900
I don't even know the reason
for his death.

28
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,790
I didn't even go to his funeral.

29
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,990
I didn't get to say goodbye.

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,180
It's alright.

31
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,290
Do you think it was painful?

32
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,410
I'm so worried that he would be in pain.

33
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,620
I'm sure he wasn't in pain.

34
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,980
He would haunt us if he was in pain.

35
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,990
Darn it.

36
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,490
He couldn't even make an omelette.

37
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,740
Why did he suddenly leave me
just like that?

38
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,329
Darn.

39
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,440
He was working on his omelette for a week.

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,910
He still couldn't make it.

41
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,140
He forced me to eat his burnt omelette.

42
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,910
I couldn't take it anymore.

43
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,329
Cooking is seriously his weakness.

44
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,410
Don't you think so?

45
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,330
I told him once

46
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,840
that he would never be able to cook.

47
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,010
He was so angry at me.

48
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,140
He really was.

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Let's go, guys.

50
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,200
Let's find something to eat.

51
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
Please don't be sad. Let's go.

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,790
I'm still waiting to taste your food.

53
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,990
I'm still waiting.

54
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,080
[Until We Meet Again]

55
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,410
Hello, Win.

56
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,410
We will be leaving at 7 a.m.

57
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,990
Move it!

58
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,490
Win, why is he so moody today?

59
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,910
I don't know.

60
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,900
He's been like this since yesterday.

61
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,400
I don't know who did this to him.

62
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,990
He yells at everyone.

63
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,410
Oh no!

64
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,990
What should we do?

65
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,320
So...

66
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,330
This is Pharm,

67
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,410
the friend you always talk about?

68
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,830
Pharm is here to deliver
the snack boxes we ordered.

69
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,909
Where should we put all these?

70
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,830
Let me ask Dean.

71
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,750
Wait!

72
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,990
Pharm is here. Let Pharm ask him.

73
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,409
Come on.

74
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,140
It's okay.

75
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,210
Go.

76
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,400
Come on. Just go!

77
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,830
Dean,

78
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,909
these snack boxes...

79
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,610
Just put them...

80
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,430
Let's go.

81
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,410
Pharm.

82
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,410
Here are the snack boxes
for the swimming club.

83
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,409
Thank you.

84
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,320
Yesterday,

85
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,320
thank you

86
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,760
for helping me.

87
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,320
Also,

88
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm sorry

89
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,330
for leaving you just like that.

90
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,910
It's just that...

91
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,910
It's okay.

92
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,410
This is for you.

93
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,910
There's your name written on it.

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,410
So it won't get mixed up with other boxes.

95
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,410
Thank you!

96
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,570
Well,

97
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,490
I have to go.

98
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,690
Why did you get the
star-shaped Look Choup?

99
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,200
You're such a cheater.

100
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,490
How come?

101
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,120
Look,

102
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,110
other people only get simple shapes.

103
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Only you get the star-shaped ones.

104
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,150
Hey!

105
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
Just stay in your seat.

106
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,410
Seems like you are happier
once there's sugar in your bloodstream.

107
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
What's that smell?

108
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,610
What are you eating?

109
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,020
Can't you see?

110
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,110
Why do you have to ask?

111
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,410
You're getting on my nerves.

112
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,690
I knew it.

113
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,430
Go!

114
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,010
Go back to your seat.

115
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,610
Quick!

116
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,930
Let's go!

117
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,900
You will get punished if you're too slow.

118
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,800
Quick!

119
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,600
Quicker!

120
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,280
The competition is coming!

121
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,570
Concentrate!

122
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,890
Faster than that!

123
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,360
Team! Faster!

124
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,530
[Team: I have something for you]

125
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,510
[I have something for you.]

126
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,350
[Don't forget to thank me!]

127
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,440
[Team: Don't forget to thank me!]

128
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,430
Dean, are you done?

129
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,940
I want to go home now.

130
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,430
Yeah. Just a moment.

131
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,610
This is taking too long.

132
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,330
Hey.

133
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,010
You're not going back yet?

134
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going soon.

135
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,010
I'm so tired.

136
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,090
I'm here to pick up my stuff first.

137
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,280
Wait.

138
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,010
Yeah?

139
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,010
How are you going back?

140
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,000
Well...

141
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,590
I'm driving back.

142
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,090
How about

143
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,590
letting me go back with you, then?

144
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,000
Where's your car?

145
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,010
I didn't leave my car here today.

146
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,000
Come on.

147
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,010
I'll drive for you.

148
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,010
Win.

149
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,010
It's okay.

150
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,750
I can drive.

151
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,290
I don't think you can do it.

152
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,850
I'm leaving, Dean.

153
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,550
Goodbye, Pruk.

154
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,210
Bye!

155
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
See you.

156
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,010
Do you think there's something
between these two?

157
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,430
Nothing.

158
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,510
Don't think too much.

159
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,430
Pharm, I'm sorry that I cannot
go home with you lately.

160
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,420
There are auditions going on
at the moment.

161
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,920
I have to go home late every day.

162
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,970
It's okay. You can go to the club first.
I can go back by myself.

163
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,860
Your car is in the garage right now.

164
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,510
Team also skipped classes
after coming back from the camp.

165
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,300
Are you sure you will be okay?

166
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,510
It's okay. And you do your best!

167
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,320
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,820
Good luck!

169
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,910
See you.

170
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,510
Bye-bye!

171
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,180
Going home alone today it is.

172
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,510
I don't want to take a motorbike taxi.

173
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,550
It's probably nothing. Let's go.

174
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,510
Pharm.

175
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,510
Pharm.

176
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,510
Pharm.

177
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,510
It's okay.

178
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,510
I'm here.

179
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,610
It's alright now.

180
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,510
Dean.

181
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,510
Be careful.

182
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,420
I think

183
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,510
we should go to the hospital.

184
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,320
It's okay.

185
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,900
I will get better after I take a rest.

186
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,700
That was not a question.

187
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,620
I'll take you to the hospital.

188
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,240
Dean...

189
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,010
Are you going to walk by yourself
or do you want me to carry you?

190
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,510
I can walk by myself.

191
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,829
Hyperventilation can be
triggered by stress.

192
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,060
It usually happens when you're
very stressed or in shock.

193
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,510
Was there an accident at that time?

194
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,510
An electric transformer exploded.

195
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,510
I'm scared of loud noises.

196
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,510
I won't be affected
if I know it beforehand.

197
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,430
But if it suddenly comes up,

198
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,510
I'll have a panic attack.

199
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,500
Does this happen often?

200
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,110
Not really.

201
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,190
Normally, I will just feel scared.

202
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,170
I rarely hyperventilate.

203
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,100
But if there's a sound like
a gunshot or an explosion,

204
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,420
I will get a severe panic attack.

205
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,590
When you were young,

206
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,510
did any incident happen to you?

207
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,200
No.

208
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,290
But my mum told me that

209
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,420
I've been scared of these sounds
since I was young.

210
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,110
So

211
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,200
can it be cured?

212
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,510
Hyperventilation syndrome can result
from a psychological state.

213
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,890
Treatment may include
anti-anxiety medications.

214
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,010
But your case is not related to anxiety.

215
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,430
If we cannot find out the actual cause,

216
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,510
it will be difficult to cure.

217
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,430
Actually,

218
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,510
we've never properly introduced ourselves.

219
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,420
My name is Dean,

220
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,510
Rattanon Wongnet.

221
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,790
I'm a third-year BBA student.

222
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,420
I have two siblings.

223
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,510
We are in the same university.

224
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,510
Their names are Don and Del.

225
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,430
I'm

226
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,510

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,430
Pharm Trivinij.

228
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,510
I'm a fresher from the
faculty of economics.

229
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,510
I have one brother, Phoom.

230
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,510
He's in the tenth grade.

231
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,160
I usually live with my siblings.

232
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,510
My parents stay abroad most of the time.

233
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,000
I live in a condo by myself.

234
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,590
My father already passed away.

235
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,470
My mum opens a restaurant
and lives in the States with my brother.

236
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,510
I was born on April 21.

237
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,510
I was born on June 16.

238
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,500
I like beaches and rivers.

239
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,590
I also like beaches and rivers.

240
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,470
I'm the president of the swimming club.

241
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,760
I'm the new member of the cooking club.

242
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,510
I like to eat Thai food.

243
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,010
I like to make Thai food.

244
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,300
I'm still single.

245
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
I'm also single.

246
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,510
Thank you.

247
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,670
Wait.

248
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,510
Yes?

249
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,510
Your number.

250
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,140

251
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,510

Just text him.

00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,430
Well, if you don't know what to say,

262
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,510
just send him a picture.

I'm sorry.

I accidentally sent it.

271
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,010
Thanks for your help yesterday.

272
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,010
It's okay.

273
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,010
Are you better now?

274
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,050
How will you go to the university?

275
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,800
Team will pick me up.

276
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,800
Actually, your condo is not
too far from my house.

277
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,010
If Team is not free,

278
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,110
I can pick you up.

279
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,250
I'll pass by your condo anyway.

280
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,010
Thank you.

281
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,600
Dean,

282
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,010
I'd love to return the favour.

283
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,930
Do you want to eat anything?

284
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,010
I'll make it for you.

285
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,490
Can you make a main dish?

286
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,330
Yes. Anything.

287
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,860
Well...

288
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,960
Can I have

289
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,470
an omelette with rice?

290
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,150
You can order a challenging dish.

291
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,660
Omelette with rice is good enough.

292
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,610
I want it for my breakfast.

293
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,420
Well...

294
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,400
I will make a rice box.

295
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,690
And give it to Team so he can
pass it to you at the club.

296
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,780
It's okay.

297
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,780
Your car is under repair, right?

298
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,910
I can pick you up and get my breakfast.

299
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,990
What do you think?

300
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,470
Pick me up?

301
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,160
Dean will pick me up at my condo?

302
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,330
It's okay. I don't want to bother you.

303
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,670
Tomorrow at 7 a.m.
I'll call you when I'm there.

304
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,300
Does he seriously want
to eat omelette with rice?

305
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,620
[Tomorrow at 7 a.m. I’ll call you when
I’m there. I'm driving. Let's talk later!]

The weight has been lifted.

307
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,140
Hey.

308
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,100
Krit, I think I will
fail this exam for sure.

309
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,490
Me too.

310
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,900
I don't even understand the question.

311
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,130
Darn!

312
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,280
What kind of question is that?

313
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,330
What did you answer?

314
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,280
All fours.

315
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,660
Dude, that's him.

316
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,310
The son of a mob boss
that I told you about.

317
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,890
That's him.

318
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,550
He's the one.

319
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,160
Him?

320
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,480
Yeah.

321
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,210
Why does he look so serious?

322
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The son of a mob boss, you know?

323
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,750
Hey!

324
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Are you serious?

325
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,450
What are you talking about?

326
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,210
He's not scary.

327
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,000
Hello there.

328
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,000

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,450
So...

333
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,210
What are you reading?

334
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,900
It seems hard.

335
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,890
Can you stop bothering me?

336
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,450
Yes, sir.

337
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,200
I will stop bothering you now.

338

Korn.

341
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,710
Korn!

342
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,710
You said you'd stop bothering me.

343
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,810
I have one last thing to say.

344
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,890
What?

345
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,810
I really like you.

346
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,360
Can I start hitting on you?

347
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,390
Nonsense.

348
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,090
I am serious.

349
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,810
You didn't say no.

350
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,890
So, it means yes.

351
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,400
I told you not to mess with him.

352
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,710
Don't you know who his father is?

353
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,900
So what?

354
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,400
He's the son of a mafia loan shark.

355
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,390
But he didn't do anything wrong.

356
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,820
He's so scary.

357
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,020
Didn't you see the news?

358
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,420
There were loan shark schemes going on.

359
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,770
People were shot and killed.

360
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,490
That's just a rumour.

361
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,130
You guys are overreacting.

362
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,790
I'm serious!

363
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,890
Don't mess with him.

364
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,190
Let's go.

365
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,000
Just wait and see.

366
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,830
You will fall for me someday.

367
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,260
Dean.

368
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,460
Dean.

369
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,260
Why are you here so early?

370
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Did I remember the wrong time?

371
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,720
Well...

372
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,470
I miscalculated the time.

373
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,190
No need to hurry.

374
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,130
I can wait.

375
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,750
Of course not.

376
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,830
You have to wait for almost an hour.

377
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,630
Since you're here already,

378
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,830
do you want to eat breakfast in my room?

379
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:21,830
I'd love to.

380
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,440
So...

381
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,260
Please wait here.

382
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:42,960
Okay.

383
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,530
Here's your water.

384
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,510
I...

385
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,840
I'll make an omelette for you.

386
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,500
So...

387
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,530
You're not going to take a shower?

388
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,430
I'll be right back!

389
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,930
[Calm down. Calm down.]

390
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,920
[I've already brushed my teeth. Silly me!]

391
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,670
Dean.

392
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,150
I told you.

393
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,730
No need to hurry.

394
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,430
I can wait.

395
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,480
We should go "eat."

396
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,390
Go "eat?"

397
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,950
I mean

398
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,950
eat breakfast.

399
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,630
Before the food gets cold.

400
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,730
Will I have a chance to eat your omelette?

401
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,940
I'll make it for you next time.

402
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,030
You won't burn it, right?

403
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,940
I promise. I guarantee.

404
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,030
It will be super yummy.

405

409
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,220
It's okay.

410
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,220
I'm here.

411
00:40:53,450 --> 00:41:00,800
[Side story]

412
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,730
What the...

413
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,440
No more data.

414
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,310
I can use my points.

415
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,550
Where's my Lays?

416
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
[Use 3 points for 400 MB of free data]

417
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,690
Lucky I've got Lays.

418
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,320
I can watch a movie now.

419
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:11,800

420
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,740
It's okay.

421
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,490
Pharm, how did you get here today?

422
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,510
Do you have a boyfriend?

423
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,300
If not,

424
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,800
I will make a move.

425
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,810
Were you busy today?

426
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,410
I called and texted you all day,
but there was no reply.
