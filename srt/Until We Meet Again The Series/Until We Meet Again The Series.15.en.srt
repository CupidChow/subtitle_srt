[Until We Meet Again]

3
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,590
Next Friday is a holiday.

4
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,570
Can I sleep over at your place?

5
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,729
This time,

6
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,140
it won't be just a sleepover.

7
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,060
Hot!

8
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,970
It's so hot!

9
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,860
You seem distracted today.

10
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,120
That's true.

11
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,800
Are you sick?

12
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,150
We're almost done. You can go home first.

13
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,670
I have another class after this.

14
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,420
You can go to class, then.
I can take care of this.

15
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,550
Here.

16
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,870
For you, if you want
to give it to someone.

17
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,990
Thank you.

18
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,940
Well...

19
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,030
I will go to my class.

20
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,450
Get some rest too.

21
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,640
Why don't you just come to class tomorrow?

22
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,990
I had to go to the swimming club first.
That's why I'm late.

23
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,920
Pharm is not here yet?

24
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,370
Did you even think before you ask?

25
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,810
The answer is very obvious.

26
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,390
He's always late.

27
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,240
He's getting worse.

28
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,850
Speak of the devil.

29
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,900
It's for you.

30
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,050
For me?

31
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,150
Lucky me.

32
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,740
Let me see.

33
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,130
What is it?

34
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,150
Thai pudding with coconut topping!

35
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,150
I love it. Let me eat it.

36
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:10,960
We have to share this.

37
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,010
No way.

38
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,390
Give me three pieces.

39
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,310
No!

40
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,780
Pharm gave this to me.

41
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,709
No. He gave it to us.

42
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,630
Manaow!

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,620
Why does he seem so weird today?

44
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,670
He is acting weird.

45
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,550
Did he put something weird
in the dessert too?

46
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,090
What's wrong? What is your symptom?
Tell me.

47
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,870
What?

48
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,550
Are you sure?

49
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,170
It's nothing.

50
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,250
Nothing at all...

51
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,930
Your pitch is higher than usual.

52
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,220
I'm going to meet my uncle.
I haven't seen him in ten years.

53
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,770
I'm nervous.

54
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,680
That's why.

55
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,330
He's overthinking.

56
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,090
I have an idea to help you release stress.

57
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,780
Let's find something to eat.

58
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,630
Fatty!

59
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,250
By the way,

60
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,570
I saw a new restaurant yesterday.

61
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,490
Do you guys want to go?

62
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,510
Where is it?

63
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,490
Right in front of our campus.

64
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,850
You just called me fatty.

65
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,900
Manaow, you're not fat.

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,430
Don't listen to Team.

67
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,850
You guys are such liars.

68
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,950
I don't think we can go today.

69
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,210
Why not?

70
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,590
Look.

71
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,540
Hello, Dean.

72
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,470
Hi.

73
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,810
You're here to see Pharm?

74
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,290
I have a date with him.

75
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,030
That's why.

76
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,960
You guys are going on a date
and you didn't tell me.

77
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,470
You know, Pharm couldn't
concentrate in class.

78
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,550
He acted like this.

79
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,300
I didn't know what was wrong with him.

80
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,700
He didn't answer me
when I asked him questions.

81
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,790
I think he was overthinking
about something.

82
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,890
Why? What's wrong?

83
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,350
Nothing.

84
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,670
Are you sure?

85
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,450
Well...

86
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,550
Let's eat together later, then.

87
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,090
Okay.

88
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,390
By the way,

89
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,230
next week,

90
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,740
the short film that I was in,

91
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,830
the result will be announced soon.

92
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,850
Everyone was complimenting our Chor Muang.

93
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,860
Thank you.

94
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,980
Keep our fingers crossed.
Let's celebrate if I win.

95
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,330
You can come with us, too.

96
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,810
You're paying, right?

97
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,430
Of course!

98
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you sure?

99
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,090
Let's think about this after I win.

100
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,850
But right now...

101
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,850
We have to go.

102
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,670
See you guys later.

103
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,310
Goodbye.

104
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,290
I'm off.

105
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,980
Bye-bye.

106
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,730
Let's go.

107
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,290
I want to eat something that you cook.

108
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,030
Okay.

109
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,850
Pineapple fried rice.

110
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,560
Let's put lots of Chinese sausage
and pork floss.

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,230
That's enough.

112
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,930
Let's pay.

113
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,010
We won't be able to finish all the food.

114
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,550
I want a bigger fridge.

115
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,390
You're so small. Why do you need
a bigger fridge?

116
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,910
I can make more desserts for you to eat.

117
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,120
We can buy a bigger one
when we move into a house.

118
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,890
I think a condo is too small.

119
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,110
Which house?

120
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,409
The house that we will live in together.

121
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,030
I prefer to live in a house
rather than a condo.

122
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,580
I will throw this away first.

123
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,010
You won't let me pay for anything.

124
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,610
Most of the things we bought

125
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,610
are for me and my club members.

126
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,920
But I use them too.

127
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,230
Am I right?

128
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,210
It's my repayment for your water
and electricity bills.

129
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,830
Also, for the time you spent
being my chef.

130
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,860
You're such a strict businessman.

131
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,330
I am.

132
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,970
Because my boyfriend studies economics.

133
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,870
That's why I have to be strict.

134
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,670
Or else he might ditch me.

135
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,690
How is that even related?

136
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,960
After we graduate,

137
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,050
you want to open a restaurant, right?

138
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,470
Then we'll have to use a lot of money.

139
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,700
I might have to borrow my dad's money
to open the restaurant.

140
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,050
Wait a second.

141
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,050
Dean.

142
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,810
It's my restaurant. Why do we have to
borrow your dad's money?

143
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,110
We are living together.
We have to help each other.

144
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,950
But...

145
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,150
You don't want to live with me?

146
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,090
It's not that.

147
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,270
I love you.

148
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,210
I love you too.

149
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,190
I want to be with you.

150
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,230
I want to be with you, too.

151
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,250
After we graduate,

152
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,690
let's move in together.

153
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,270
Why are you crying?

154
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,550
Don't cry.

155
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,490
You...

156
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,970
You said it like you're
asking me to marry you.

157
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,600
I am asking you now.

158
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,050
Dean...

159
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,610
Your mum lives in New York, right?

160
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,210
If I remember correctly,

161
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,210
same-sex marriage is legal there.

162
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,250
Come on.

163
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,700
Let's dig in.

164
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,390
You have to eat a lot.

165
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,340
Don't change the topic yet.

166
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,430
This is a big deal.

167
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,540
Yes, it's a big deal.

168
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,890
But in the end,

169
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,530
it's still our decision, isn't it?

170
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,030
That's true.

171
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,610
Stop overthinking.

172
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,550
We still have a lot of time to think

173
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,630
until we graduate.

174
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,590
If nothing changes,

175
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,650
I will ask you again.

176
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,350
Okay?

177
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,270
Okay.

178
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,510
Let's dig in.

179
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,470
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

180
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,870
Look at this.

181
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,090
It looks yummy.

182
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,560
You have to finish the whole thing, then.

183
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,990
Of course,

184
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,990
I will finish the whole thing.

185
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
Oh shoot!

186
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,150
What are you doing?

187
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,720
Nothing.

188
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,780
You found it?

189
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,460
When did you buy it?

190
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,840
When you went to throw away
your bubble tea.

191
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,280
Why did you buy it?

192
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,240
Didn't you learn about this
in health education?

193
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,000
This is very important.

194
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,820
It's about hygiene

195
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,670
and safety.

196
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,600
Dean.

197
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,540
What are you doing?

198
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,450
The TV is still on.

199
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,280
Just keep it on.

200
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,600
The light is on too!

201
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,340
That's good.

202
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,230
I can see you clearly.

203
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,110
That's not good at all.

204
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,530
It is.

205
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,490
Dean.

206
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,610
Dean.

207
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,270
Dean.

208
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,030
Stop it.

209
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,110
I surrender.

210
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,710
I love you.

211
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,230
I love you too.

212
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,650
Where's In?

213
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,470
He said he's got a headache.

214
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,670
He went to sleep in the building
for half an hour.

215
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,990
Is he dead now?

216
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,990
Why didn't he go back home?

217
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,630
He told me he's fine.

218
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,690
Are you going to see him?

219
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,770
Yes.

220
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,609
Can you pass some medicine to him?

221
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,470
And some water too.

222
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,990
I'll be right back.

223
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,710
In.

224
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,330
Take this medicine.

225
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,890
Thank you.

226
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,230
I hope that you will always be happy.

227
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,610
Do you like my hands?

228
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,550
I do.

229
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,590
They remind me of my dad's hands.

230
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,210
I'm just kidding.

231
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,290
You're not my daddy.

232
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,020
Look.

233
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,110
Your hands are bigger than my face.

234
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,350
Stop being so cute.

235
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,270
Or you might not be able to get up.

236
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,350
Dean.

237
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,390
Stop it.

238
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,490
Stop it now.

239
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,000
I won't.

240
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,750
Dean.

241
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,870
Stop.

242
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,920
You smell nice.

243
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,250
Dean.

244
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,930
Stop teasing me.

245
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,320
Are you hungry?

246
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,550
I'm hungry.

247
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,850
Hungry for food?

248
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,860
Food, of course.

249
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,350
Dean...

250
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,160
I will buy some porridge for you, then.

251
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,650
Okay.

252
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,590
Should I go?

253
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,030
Just go.

254
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,110
I'm hungry.

255
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,110
I don't want to go now.

256
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,210
Fine. I'll go.

257
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,790
I'll be right back.

258
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,230
Okay.

259
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,420
Did you buy everything they have?

260
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,320
Let me see.

261
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,920
[Be gentle with him, dude!]

262
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,180
I don't think you need to take
fever medicine.

263
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,040
And for other parts...

264
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,280
Is there any part that still hurts?

265
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,720
Did you buy all this?

266
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,420
Pharm.

267
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,920
Are you really okay?

268
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,440
Are you alright?

269
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm fine.

270
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,340
Come on, let's play!

271
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,300
In.

272
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,880
In,

273
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,920
I love you.

274
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,020
Dean.

275
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,500
Dean.

276
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,340
Dean.

277
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,780
Dean.

278
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,260
Dean.

279
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,740
Pharm.

280
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,560
Pharm, don't leave me.

281
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,120
Where can I go?

282
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,640
I belong to you.

283
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,820
No matter what happens,

284
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm right here.

285
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,320
Think of me.

286
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,280
Do you understand?

287
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,080
You'll be the first person
that I think of.

288
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,620
Since when?

289
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
When did you have someone spy on me?

290
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,980
You answer me!

291
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,840
Since when did you go out with this boy?

292
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,160
This is my personal life!

293
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,410
You two have to break up.

294
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,780
It doesn't matter which girl
you go out with.

295
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,640
But you cannot go out with a boy.

296
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,300
Dad!

297
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,180
Other people will say
that my son is abnormal.

298
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,040
It doesn't matter what other people say.

299
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,660
We didn't do anything wrong.

300
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,140
I won't let you. I cannot accept this!

301
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,150
Don't you dare go to see him again.

302
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,530
You cannot force me.

303
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,120
What are you going to do?

304
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,860
Just go back to your room.
If you dare to go against me...

305
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,590
This boy will be in trouble.

306
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,960
Bro.

307
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,110
What's the matter?

308
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,520
I heard you and Dad talking.

309
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,960
I also know that

310
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,120
you have a boyfriend.

311
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,860
How did you know?

312
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,030
A few days ago,

313
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,370
I saw you walking with Intouch.

314
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,200
We're just friends.

315
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,250
You won't smile at a friend that way.

316
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,900
I know.

317
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,810
I can see the difference in your smile.

318
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,930
Also,

319
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,340
you look much happier
when you're with him.

320
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,740
Korn.

321
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,650
Whatever you do that makes you happy,

322
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,500
just do it.

323
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,010
About Dad's work,

324
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,890
I can deal with that.

325
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,060
Krit.

326
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,430
Don't say that.

327
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,970
You said you wanted to be a policeman.

328
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,270
That will be hard.

329
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,270
Our dad hates policemen.

330
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,580
Krit.

331
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,550
But dad's work

332
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,950
is illegal.

333
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,340
I don't want you to get involved.

334
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,190
Do you understand?

335
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,560
But...

336
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,270
There are no buts, Krit.

337
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,130
Just be whatever you want to be.

338
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,990
Do you understand?

339
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,460
Got it.

340
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,450
You too.

341
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,050
Don't just think about us.

342
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,130
Think about your own happiness as well.

343
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,960
You have to be a policeman.

344
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,180
Take good care of Kard.

345
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,040
Do you understand?

346
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,070
I understand.

347
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,840
I'm so great.

348
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,060
I can do it.

349
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,570
That's right.

350
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,420
Go.

351
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,410
Go back to your room

352
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,620
before dad sees you here.

353
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,650
You will get into trouble.

354
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,860
Let's talk tomorrow, then.

355
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,930
Your hands are very cold.

356
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,950
I've never met him before.

357
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,520
I've never met my uncle or my grandpa.

358
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,360
My mum told me I met him
when I was really young.

359
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,190
But I couldn't remember anything.

360
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,210
You guys are related.
I don't think it's going to be a problem.

361
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,190
I'm scared somehow.

362
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,930
You've set my number
as an emergency number, right?

363
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,250
If anything goes wrong,

364
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,500
or if you want me to pick you up,

365
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,790
call me right away.

366
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,830
Okay.

367
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,460
Next school break,

368
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,320
let's go to the States.

369
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,530
I told your mum already.

370
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,100
Are you serious?

371
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,460
I'm serious.

372
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,930
I've already told my parents, too.

373
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,570
Maybe

374
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,350
my parents will come with us.

375
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,340
Grandma might come too.

376
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,300
An is coming too?

377
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
Alin...

378
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,790
I mean, your mum too?

379
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,850
Of course.

380
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:51,160
My family said since I took you in,

381
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,810
I have to show my responsibility.

382
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,630
My cousin is already 15 minutes late.

383
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,590
My mum didn't give me
his phone number either.

384
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,370
If he doesn't show up within the hour,
I will take you back.

385
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,750
That won't be necessary.

386
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,679
I've been here for a while already.

387
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,909
I saw you two talking.

388
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,730
I didn't want to interrupt.

389
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,489
Hello, Cousin.

390
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,770
Are you ready?

391
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,760
Silp.

392
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,790
You're his cousin?

393
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,790
Yes.

394
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
Pharm.

395
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,940
Don't forget.

396
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,429
If anything happens, just call me anytime.

397
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,949
Okay.

398
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,170
I will leave then.

399
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,310
Please look after him for me.

400
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,690
Are you surprised?

401
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,740
Yes.

402
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,290
I've only just found out
you're my cousin as well.

403
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,050
Since when did you know?

404
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,420
Since...

405
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,730
Since I knew which room was yours.

406
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,040
That's a while ago.

407
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,230
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,770
My dad bought two rooms.

409
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,160
The big one is for me
and my younger brother.

410
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,420
The other one is for my little sister.

411
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,370
But right now, my sister is living abroad.

412
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,390
After I graduated, I bought
the room from my dad.

413
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,640
My younger brother got into
the university in the city.

414
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,560
He's actually looking for
a place to stay right now.

415
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,410
My dad saw that the room was available,
so he let you stay instead.

416
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,390
So, you are my mum's spy.

417
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,330
In exchange, I got a collection
of shoes from the USA.

418
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,110
I didn't let you know at first
because I felt sorry for you.

419
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,050
If I had shown myself as your cousin,

420
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,130
Dean wouldn't be able
to do anything to you.

421
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,910
You know?

422
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,220
The walls of this condo
might block some sound,

423
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,750
but the door on the balcony doesn't.

424
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,670
As it happens,

425
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
I like to smoke on the balcony.

426
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,970
Dean didn't tell you I gave you
all those medicines?

427
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,940
He didn't.

428
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,230
Dean is nice to you, right?

429
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,420
He is very kind.

430
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,940
That night,

431
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,610
I had already planned that if you
kept crying and Dean wouldn't stop,

432
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,700
I would climb over to your room.

433
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,380
Silp...

434
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,270
What is your dad like?

435
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,580
My dad?

436
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,170
He used to be a policeman.

437
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,740
He was a workaholic.

438
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,060
But he's retired now.

439
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,970
He's very straightforward.

440
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,360
He's very strict.

441
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,980
He wouldn't give me any information
when I asked.

442
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,840
Also,

443
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,660
he's an old man who tends to sulk a lot.

444
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,100
Actually, he's a very kind uncle.

445
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,970
He loves his family.

446
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,540
He's a reasonable man.

447
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,980
Are you ready?

448
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,090
Yes.

449
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,210
Let's go.

450
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,710
Silp and Pharm are cousins?

451
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,860
He never told you that?

452
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,420
We don't really talk about his family.

453
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,520
I understand now why he cares
about Pharm so much.

454
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,640
Sorn.

455
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,380
What is Silp's surname?

456
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,340
You really don't know?

457
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,130
His dad appears on TV quite often.

458
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,360
I really don't know.

459
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,860
Ariyasakul.

460
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,980
Silp's surname is Ariyasakul.

461
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,090
Korn.

462
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,090
Wait for me.

463
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,780
I told you to stop bothering me.

464
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,760
Don't you know my name?

465
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,250
I know.

466
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,790
How can I not know the name
of someone I like?

467
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,800
Korn Ariyasakul. That's your name.

468
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,940
Dean.

469
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,290
Dean.

470
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,620
Dean.

471
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,950
Dean.

472
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,100
What's wrong?

473
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,130
Nothing.

474
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,270
Pharm.

475
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,500
[Next episode]

476
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,960
Dad.

477
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,920
What's your older brother's name?
