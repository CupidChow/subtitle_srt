Of course. He is the swimmer
of his faculty.

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,330
Hello. My name is Aum.
I am the club president.

176
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,730
And over there with the grey hair is Dej.

177
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,820
He's the vice president.

178
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,820
And this is...

179
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,810
Giffy!

180
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,820
I'm Giffy.

181
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,900
I am the assistant.

182
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,820
My name is Pharm.

183
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,850
I'm a fresher from the
Faculty of Economics.

184
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,720
Our club doesn't have many people.
You are very welcome here.

185
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,570
I am so happy that a guy
is finally joining our club!

186
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,820
I have been gaining muscles
from carrying all these flour bags.

187
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,810
Let me know if you guys need any help.

188
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,530
I am good at making Thai food and dessert.

189
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,319
I can do some food carving as well!

190
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,290
That's very good, Pharm!

191
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,550
Our club participates in
many activities at the university.

192
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,040
It will be great to have
an amazing cook like you in our club!

193
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,140
My pleasure!

194
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,460
Anyway, I will let you know
if there is any activity coming up.

195
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,319
Sure.

196
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,900
Let me have your LINE account first.

197
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,900
Yes, your LINE account. Write it clearly.

198
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Okay, I will contact you soon.

199
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,940
Sure!

200
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,860
I will excuse myself then.

201
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,320
-Sure! See you.
-Goodbye.

202
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,900
Goodbye. See you!

203
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,990
You are overreacting!

204
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,780
You will scare him away.

205
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,400
He is so cute!

206
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,820
Hello!

207
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,810
Can I take a photo with you?

208
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Sure.

209
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Thank you!

210
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,810
My name is Manaow.

211
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,820
I like you so much!

212
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,360
Thank you so much.

213
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,170
-Here.
-Okay.

214
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,970
You have a very unique character.

215
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,620
Really?

216
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,600
Write your name here.

217
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,070
I'm very good at acting.

218
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,800
You can act?

219
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,810
Yes!

220
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,820
Okay. That's good!

221
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,120
I can act as a stone.

222
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Really?

223
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,900
Imagine it's raining.

224
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,820
I feel so cold!

225
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,710
A stone must be able to express feelings?

226
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,820
Yes. Yes. You are very good at acting.

227
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,810
Superb!

228
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,820
Very good.

229
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,900
I can act as different characters
in one person.

230
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Right.

231
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,820
Hello! What's your name?

232
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,810
I'm Manaow!

233
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,820
Have you eaten yet?

234
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,820
No, I haven't!

235
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,520
Do you think I'm good at acting?

236
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,170
Yes. Yes. You're good.

237
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,930
Thank you!

238
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:11,960
You can write...

239
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,870
I can sing too!

240
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,890
You can do more?

241
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,400
-Let me warm up first.
-Go ahead.

242
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,520
Na na na. Feel the rain on your skin...

243
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,820
Guys.

244
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm so excited!

245
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,670
May I register?

246
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,410
Sure! You can write your name now.

247
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,420
Manaow, right?

248
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:33,960
Yeah.

249
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,470
Go ahead.

250
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,820
Great.

251
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,600
Cool.

252
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,720
Thanks!

253
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,650
I can also act as a seductive woman.

254
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,320
Seductive?

255
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,230
Yes. That's right.

256
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,390
What kind of a seducer?

257
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,900
I will not disappoint you.

258
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,450
I'm very good at seducing men.

259
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,730
Okay, I got it.

260
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,310
Just a moment. Let me concentrate first.

261
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,900
How's that?

262
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,310
Very sexy, right?

263
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,500
-Very sexy alright.
-I'm so glad!

264
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,820
Don't forget my name. I'm Manaow.

265
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,810
I really like you!

266
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,900
Right, zesty Manaow.

267
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,820
Let's continue, everyone.

268
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Write your name here.

269
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,820
There are so many girls joining the club.

270
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,810
I almost fainted.

271
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,460
Of course, it is a drama club.

272
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,350
I saw an actor there too.

273
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,490
But if you're interested
to see a lot of guys,

274
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,810
come and join my club!

275
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,440
No, it's too hot.

276
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,160
True. It's so hot.

277
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,140
Look at my arms.

278
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,700
I got all these bad sunburns.

279
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,600
Oh no! Why don't you use sunscreen?

280
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,390
Your skin will get worse.

281
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,900
Pharm, I think we are
having a second mum now.

282
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,900
Hello, mummy.

283
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,460
That sound is so loud.

284
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,900
It crashed right in front of here.

285
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,820
Pharm, what's wrong?
Why do you look so pale?

286
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,810
Pharm.

287
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Are you okay?

288
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,720
I...

289
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,820
I was scared of that noise.

290
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Why are you so scared of that noise?

291
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,190
Well...

292
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,470
I've been scared of loud noises
since I was very young.

293
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,330
If I hear an unexpected loud noise,

294
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,980
I will be shocked, just like that.

295
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,700
How loud is the noise
that will make you panic?

296
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,400
Like, the sound of lightning,

297
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,400
guns, bombs. Stuff like that.

298
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,820
What if it's an action movie?

299
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,820
That won't make me scared.

300
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,810
Those jump scare scenes
in horror movies also don't scare me.

301
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,400
What about starting pistols used in races?

302
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,320
I will know it beforehand.

303
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,520
It shouldn't be a problem.

304
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,680
I see.

305
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,810
So, that means

306
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,900
you won't have a problem when we go
watch Dean at the swimming competition.

307
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,810
You know, I think

308
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,630
I am much stronger than Pharm.

309
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,160
Look at me.

310
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,400
Do I look stronger?

311
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,620
And look at Pharm.

312
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,400
Stand up for a second.

313
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,900
Look, he's only a little bit
taller than me.

314
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,900
Your weight is also...

315
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,820
So tiny!

316
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,440
Let me protect you.

317
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,590
What do you want to protect me from?

318
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,900
Let me protect both of you.

319
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,120
You are crazy and overreacting.

320
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,930
How can you protect us?

321
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,360
Pharm, you know nothing.

322
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,820
You are the type of guy that girls like
to ship with another guy.

323
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,590
That is so true!

324
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,820
I want to ship you with Dean.

325
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,820
You know, with this height.

326
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,840
A tall senior and a tiny fresher!

327
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,820
What are you talking about, Manaow?

328
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
Stop talking and go back to your seat.

329
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,390
You are blushing now.

330
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,210
Are you shy?

331
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,820
Stop talking about this!

332
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm asking. Why are you so shy?

333
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,080
I am not!

334
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,900
But you're blushing.

335
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,950
Why do I feel so sad when I look at him?

336
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,590
I have to go back early.

337
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,200
Why do you have to go back early today?

338
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,210
Because my father will come back today.

339
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,290
I have to be home before he arrives.

340
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,790
What will happen if you
won't make it in time?

341
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,790
He will probably punch me.

342
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,290
Hey, Korn.

343
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,290
If...

344
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,290
What?

345
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,740
If we died and we were born again,

346
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,290
do you think we would find each other?

347
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,290
Nonsense!

348
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,590
Did you watch too many dramas?

349
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,290
I'm serious here.

350
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,290
Of course, we will.

351
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,290
Really?

352
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,900
Yes.

353
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,290
I will keep searching until I find you.

354
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,430
What if

355
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,620
we live on different continents?

356
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,290
I will get on a plane to find you.

357
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,290
You're so rich!

358
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,290
I will also search for you.

359
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,290
Promise me that we will
always find each other.

360
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,290
I promise.

361
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,210
Hey.

362
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,290
Where's your pinky promise?

363
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,290
Korn.

364
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,790
We made a promise that we will
always find each other.

365
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,210
Dude!

366
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,200
I told you to glue this piece here.
Why did you cut it?

367
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,940
I didn't know.

368
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,200
Why didn't you look at the template?

369
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,350
Can we make a new one?

370
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,830
You go out and buy a new one for me then.

371
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,810
Fine!

372
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,310
You have to pay!

373
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,290
Fine!

374
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,690
Here, take it!

375
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,860
Don't forget to help me!

376
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,290
I know. I will help you later.

377
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,620
Oh!

378
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,530
It's eight o'clock already!

379
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,290
Did I have a nightmare?

380
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,290
Promise me that we will
always find each other.

381
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,200
If we died and we were born again,

382
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,210
do you think we will find
each other again?

383
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,290
Of course, we will.

384
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,210
Really?

385
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,290
I will keep searching until I find you.

386
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,290
Calm down. The teacher is not here yet.

387
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,210
Hey, Pharm.

388
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,700
Did you wake up late today?

389
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,790
Yeah.

390
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,790
Did you see the Cute Boy
Facebook page yesterday?

391
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,200
What Cute Boy?

392
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,290
That page that uploads photos
of cute guys.

393
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,290
Just a second.

394
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,290
Here. This one.

395
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,950
What?

396
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,200
No matter how cute he is,
I don't want him.

397
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,290
I don't want you either.

398
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,200
I think it's cute.

399
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,290
No!

400
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,220
I'm just saying... it's cute.

401
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,210
Please no!

402
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,290
Fine!

403
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,700
So...

404
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,210
Have your club activities started yet?

405
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,710
Not yet.

406
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,200
Mine starts next week.

407
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,210
That's great!

408
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,200
Today I have a swimming try-out.

409
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,090
Come and cheer me up. Please?

410
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,400
At the swimming club?

411
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,290
Yes. Yes. At my swimming club.

412
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,150
Let's go, Pharm.

413
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,790
I want to see naked guys.

414
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,100
No, I mean...

415
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,290
I want to see guys swim.

416
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,210
I don't want to look at you.

417
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,910
I want to look at other guys.

418
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,010
Just wait and see!

419
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,360
Can I say no?

420
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,790
You can't!

421
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,700
Why are you copying me?

422
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,300
Then why did you say it first?

423
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,020
-Why are you copying me?
-Why did you say it first?

424
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,200
Don't you argue.

425
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,610
Why are you copying me?

426
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Shut up, Manaow.

427
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,320
You, shut up.

428
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,890
Fine!

429
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,040
Fine!

430
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,980
Let's go, Pharm.

431
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,520
Pharm, you come with me.

432
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,090
No Pharm, come with me.

433
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,400
No! Come here, Pharm.

434
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,990
Pharm.

435
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,380
Let's go, both of you!

436
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,020
Manaow, you go first.

437
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,790
There are so many people.

438
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,210
I thought it's just a try-out.

439
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,210
Don't you know our university
swimming club is so famous?

440
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,290
They got so many awards.

441
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,290
Let's sit there.

442
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,200
Here they come.

443
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,290
Let's sit.

444
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,980
Where's Team?

445
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,910
Team...

446
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,210
Where?

447
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,790
He's there!

448
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,200
Team is actually fit.

449
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,290
Manaow, he's our friend!

450
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,690
If I could turn back time,
I wouldn't be his friend.

451
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,659
Manaow, you silly!

452
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,780
Look at that guy. He's really hot!

453
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,290
This year seems to have
a lot of potential.

454
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,710
Great.

455
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,290
They can substitute our graduated seniors.

456
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,540
Oh, hey!

457
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,290
What are you looking at?

458
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,389
Hey!

459
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,800
Hey there!

460
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,290
Let's get going, Mr President!

461
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:58,290
Let's start once you all are ready.

462
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,390
Here we go!

463
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,290
Take your mark.

464
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,200
Team!

465
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,290
Go! Go!

466
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,290
Keep going!

467
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,390
You got it, Team!

468
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,290
Team, quick!

469
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,030
Team is leading now.

470
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,210
Go, Team!

471
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,130
I'll buy you snacks after!

472
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,740
Go get them, Team!

473
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,410
Team is leading now.

474
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,850
He made it!

475
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,640
You did very well!

476
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,820
Well done!

477
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,290
Let's go see him.

478
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,290
Let's go.

479
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,290
He's great.

480
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,210
Team is so talented!

481
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,290
He is actually really good.

482
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,730
Good job!

483
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,710
You are now in the team.

484
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,710
Of course.

485
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,290
Don't you know who I am?

486
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,090
I was planning to compliment you,
but now I've changed my mind.

487
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,130
But

488
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,210
I'm so hungry now.

489
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,290
I already used up all my energy.

490
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,880
Let's find something to eat.

491
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,810
Hey, I'm wet now!

492
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,030
By the way,

493
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,290
where is Dean?

494
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,200
Over there.

495
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,200
Why are you always asking about guys?

496
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,250
Where is the innocent little girl
that we met on the first day?

497
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,450
I'm still an innocent girl.

498
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,290
I'm just asking for Pharm.

499
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,210
It has nothing to do with me!

500
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:07,490
I saw the way you looked at him.
You didn't even blink.

501
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,290
I didn't do that!

502
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,210
Stop it!

503
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,790
Let's go and eat then.

504
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,790
I'm hungry.

505
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,290
That's the fresher
whose name is Team, right?

506
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,820
His friends probably have been waiting.

507
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,210
The freshers are so cute, aren't they?

508
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,290
True. She's cute.

509
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,210
Don't you need to get changed?

510
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,200
I can go now. I have a good body.

511
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,790
No need to be ashamed.

512
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,250
Please have some shame.

513
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,950
Just go and change first.

514
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,150
I will wait for you outside.

515
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,530
-Please?
-Sure.

516
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,290
-I'll see you guys outside.
-Okay!

517
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,850
What?

518
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,700
Just go.

519
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,880
You are hurting my eyes.
I don't want to look.

520
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,090
Dean, What's wrong?

521
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,030
Nothing.

522
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,290
Just itchy eyes.

523
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,680
[Wow!]

524
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,750
[Why do you suddenly want
to make the dessert?]

525
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,930
I just feel like eating it.

526
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,820
I'm making them for my friends too.

527
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,460
[I miss your cooking.]

528
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,100
I will cook for you
when I visit you in America.

529
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,970
[I hope that's true.]

530

[What if you have a girlfriend
and forget about me?]

531
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,950
What are you talking about?

532
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,270
Just stop there.

533
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,460
What time is it over there?

534
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,360
It's nearly time to open
the restaurant, right?

535
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,050
[You're right. I have to go now.]

536

538

Dad is also here with me.

539

[I will call you later, then.]

540
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,830
Okay.

541
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,370

553
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,530
What's this?

554
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,960
Puddings with coconut topping?

555
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,480
Nope.

556
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,860
They are similar, but this one
is called Leum Kluen.

557
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,360
Leum Kluen?

558
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,530
I've never heard of it before.

559
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,770
Look at this.

560
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,780
They are green and blue.

561
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,340
So pretty!

562
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,050
The green ones are made from pandan leaf.

563
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,840
The blue ones are made
from butterfly-pea flowers.

564
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,810
Cheers!

565
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,750
How is it?

566
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,910
I actually forgot to swallow.

567
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,830
It's so good.

568
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,830
It's really good.

569
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,910
It's so soft and has a good smell.

570
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,540
It has a smooth texture, right?

571
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,200
That's why you keep eating it
and forget to swallow.

572
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,580
That's why this dessert
is called Leum Kluen (forget to swallow).

573
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,050
Pharm, you are so talented.

574
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,350
You are more delicate than a girl like me.

575
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,700
There are so many male chefs.

576
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,620
It doesn't matter if you are
male or female.

577
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,660
So...

578
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,470
If you like cooking,

579
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,590
why don't you study at the
Faculty of Home Economics?

580
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,210
Because this university
doesn't have that faculty.

581
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,350
That's why I chose Economics instead.

582
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,290
Well, that's true.

583
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,450
What's wrong?

584
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,450
Actually,

585
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,720
I made so many.

586
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,070
You guys can share them
with your club members.

587
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,150
Yes. Of course!

588
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,250
I will have all of them then.

589
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,820
Is that equal?

590
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,300
It is.

591
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,700
Thank you so much, Pharm.

592
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,450
It smells nice.

593
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,600

594

598
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,720
You don't have to worry.

599
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,570

600

No!

I want you to share
with other people, not just Dean.

602

I know. I know.

603
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,320

gets to eat the most.

604

609
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,410
does this one have an owner?

610
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,410
Nope.

611
