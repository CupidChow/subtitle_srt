1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,660
Mum, what are you doing?

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,920
You’re here just in time.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,740
Help me make Look Choup.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,300
Look Choup?

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,650
Why are you making all these by yourself?

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,170
It’s much easier if you just buy them.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,270
That’s true.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,350
But the feeling is different.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,440
What’s the difference?

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,000
If we put our effort in the making,

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,690
the person who eats it
will definitely feel that.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,230
It’s not just about the taste.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,990
But it’s also about the feeling.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,500
Why don’t you make these
for your special one?

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,680
Mum.

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,920
I…

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,239
About that guy?

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,100
You know about him?

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,920
I know.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,240
Do you think I’m abnormal?

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,320
What is your definition of abnormal?

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,430
Well...

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,430
You might like something
that is not similar to others.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,100
But that doesn’t make you
different from everyone else.

26
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,970
Your life belongs to you.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,440
But remember that

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,030
we’re still living in this society.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,860
People will still judge you
from what they see.

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,450
I know that, Mum.

31
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,140
But I don’t care what other people think.

32
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,690
As long as

33
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,240
people in my family,

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
Dad,

35
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,630
you

36
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,700
and An

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,810
don’t think I’m strange,

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,950
that is already enough for me.

39
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,830
But...

40
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,910
Dad...

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,980
Some things take time.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,050
Make a wish.

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,820
Does it taste good?

44
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,300
I think it’s pretty good.

45
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,340
I just dropped that one on the floor.

46
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,770
Are you serious?

47
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,140
Yes.

48
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,240
Yummy?

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,750
Why do you like to tease me?

50
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,840
I forgot to clean my hands.

51
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,410
[Until We Meet Again]

52
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,900
Hello, everyone!

53
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,110
My name is Aum.

54
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,100
I am the president of this cooking club.

55
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,110
Welcome all the new members to the club!

56
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,910
Our club might not have a lot of members,

57
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,630
but we are rich with qualities.

58
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,110
Like this person here.

59
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,700
I’m Giffy.

60
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,470
She’s good with cooking main dishes.

61
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,420
And this grey hair guy is Dej.

62
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,020
He is the vice president.

63
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,420
Please give them a round of applause.

64
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,240
Our club is not just for cooking.

65
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,320
We also provide classes for outsiders

66
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,409
and help with the university's events.

67
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,930
Over there is a prepping station.

68
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,970
You can cook the main dishes
and desserts there.

69
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,130
We also have utensils for Thai dishes

70
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,080
including brass pan, spatula, steamer pot.

71
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,760
Can I use this room
outside the club activity time?

72
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,390
Yes, but let me know beforehand.

73
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,100
Oh!

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
I have an announcement.

75
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,960
Our club has an order
to make 40 snack boxes.

76
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,370
Any volunteers?

77
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,420
Extra points and pocket money
will be given as well.

78
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,620
Anyone?

79
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,420
Is this for the university event?

80
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,420
This is not for the university event.

81
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,620
This one is for the swimming club.

82
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,620
They're having welcoming activities
at the beach.

83
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,020
So, they want to have
snack boxes on the go.

84
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,220
Anyone wants to help?

85
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,190
There’s pocket money too.

86
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,260
I volunteer.

87
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,780
Anyone else?

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,860
-Let's go!
-Okay, sure.

89
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,210
[We’ll make sandwiches
for the snack boxes.]

90
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,900
[We do have a lot of budget and we can
make more desserts.]

91
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,670
[Do you have any ideas?]

92
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,140
[Desserts?]

93
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,990
[Don’t forget to do your homework.]

94
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,420
[Team, how’s the dessert
I gave you today?]

95
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,420
[Very good! Everyone loves it.]

96
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,620
[Okay. I will make more then.]

97
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,990
[Why didn’t you ask if
my club members like it or not?]

98
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,420
[I was going to!]

99
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,070
[I forgot. My club doesn’t have Dean.]

100
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,419
[No! It’s not that. So, do they like it?]

101
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,210
[Of course. They love it!]

102
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,340
[Hehe]

103
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,420
[What are you laughing at? Seems evil.]

104
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,790
[Don’t forget to give me
more food tomorrow!]

105
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,960
[I never forget.]

106
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,610
What’s this?

107
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,620
Well, it's an omelet.

108
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,210
Why does it look like this?

109
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,510
It burnt and got stuck to the pan.

110
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,630
It was so hard to get it off the pan.

111
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,540
You don’t have to eat it.

112
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,010
Let’s go buy food at
the auntie’s restaurant downstairs.

113
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,640
Eat this first then.

114
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,940
Dessert?

115
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,190
Yes.

116
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,270
I helped my mum make this.

117
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,400
Especially this one,

118
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,160
a star-shaped Look Choup.

119
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,040
It’s very hard to make.

120
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,410
You can try it.

121
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,920
There’s no harm eating this!

122
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,880
How is it?

123
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,650
Does it smell nice?

124
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
It’s really good.

125
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,930
I baked this with a fragrant candle too.

126
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,420
I don’t have a chance to eat the omelet?

127
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,570
I will make it for you next time.

128
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,740
It won’t burn next time, right?

129
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,730
I promise. I guarantee.

130
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,820
It will be super yummy.

131
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,450
A star-shaped Look Choup.

132
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,950
It’s very hard to make.

133
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,650
You can try it.

134
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,460
Dean,

135
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,460
Can I sleep over at
my friend’s this weekend?

136
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,130
I have to discuss my project.

137
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,620
I have to go on a camp this weekend.

138
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,590
No one's home.

139
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,310
You have to come back home
to stay with Del.

140
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,420
But...

141
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,100
It’s okay.

142
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,420
I can stay on my own.

143
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,680
No, you cannot!

144
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,690
There’re only girls in the house.
It’s dangerous.

145
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I’ll call to check up on you.

146
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,610
How about your breakfast?

147
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,420
Auntie.

148
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:35,930
Yes?

149
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,940
Can I have rice with omelet?

150
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,610
Okay.

151
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,410
Thank you.

152
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
This omelet is not burnt.

153
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,780
What’s up?

154
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,210
I’m at the university now.
What’s the problem?

155
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,050
Yeah.

156
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,460
I’ll meet you at the club.

157
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,340
Yes, I’m here.

158
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,000
Where are you?

159
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,320
I got it.

160
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Okay. Come quickly!

161
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,620
Team!

162
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,180
I’m here.

163
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,730
Here’s your water.

164
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,339
Thank you so much.

165
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,460
Wow!

166
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,380
Yours look so good.

167
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,650
Let me have some.

168
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,819
Team!

169
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,930
What the heck?

170
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,450
Why are you so stingy?

171
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,250
Why do you eat just an omelet?

172
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,250
I just feel like eating it.

173
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,569
Do you know?

174
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:26,380
Omelet is the first menu
that I learned to cook.

175
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,810
So...

176
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,310
When did you first learn how to cook?

177
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,940
When my height is not even
over the kitchen counter,

178
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,620
I secretly cooked an omelet.

179
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,480
My mum hit me when she found out
that I turned on the stove by myself.

180
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,230
You deserve it.

181
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,740
I was already a grown man
when I started to cook.

182
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,020
By the way,

183
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,620
I have a question

184
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,990
to ask you.

185
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,700
I’ll let you guess.

186
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,970
What is the first dish
that I cooked by myself?

187
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,450
Instant noodle!

188
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,190
What the…

189
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,800
This is not fun at all!

190
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,320
It’s correct, isn’t it?

191
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,310
Yeah.

192
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,110
I don’t think you can cook anything else.

193
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,120
I can do many things.

194
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,590
Like what? Boiling eggs?

195
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,110
Stealing your omelet.

196
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,000
Team!

197
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,050
Stop it!

198
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,720
- So stingy!
- Go and buy it by yourself.

199
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,320
Fine, I’ll just eat my own food.

200
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,920
Eat it then.

201
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,150
Dude!

202
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,530
Just eat.

203
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,590
Pharm!

204
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,580
Pharm!

205
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,780
Pharm!

206
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,290
Do you know Dean's post means?

207
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,390
Have you met him before?

208
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,970
Why did he post “Never forget”?

209
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,890
I don’t know either.

210
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,890
I've never met him before.

211
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,830
Really?

212
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,760
Everyone is so surprised.

213
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,640
Dean hasn’t posted his status
for more than half a year.

214
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,730
It’s amazing.

215
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,800
Maybe he's never had the dessert before.

216
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,880
That’s why he posted it.

217
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,350
Really?

218
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,890
But I think…

219
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,040
How do I explain this?

220
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,700
I actually feel that

221
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,710
you and him...

222
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,390
Both of you.

223
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,860
There’s something, you know...

224
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,890
that clicks.

225
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,890
That is such a Yaoi fangirl’s instinct.

226
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,890
What’s Yaoi fangirl?

227
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,890
Those girls who like
to ship guys together.

228
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,470
Hey.

229
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,890
Even though, I’m a Yaoi fangirl.

230
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,190
But in real life, I won’t force
my friend with another guy.

231
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,840
Anyway...

232
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,390
Are you angry when I ship you with Dean?

233
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,240
Don’t worry, Manaow.

234
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,460
If I had not liked it,
I would have told you already.

235
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,740
So, that means you like it?

236
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,890
I…

237
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,290
I’m not sure.

238
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,990
But there’s a chance, right?

239
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,170
A fifty-fifty chance?

240
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
This is a serious question.

241
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,890
Do you like Dean?

242
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,970
I don’t know either.

243
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,300
Well...

244
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,110
If I tell you this,
you must not laugh at me.

245
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,210
I won’t.

246
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,090
Since I was young,

247
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,110
I've been thinking of one person.

248
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,070
And then?

249
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,300
I don’t know what he looks like.

250
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,930
It's...

251
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,020
It’s unclear.

252
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,390
The only thing I know is
that I’m happy when I’m with him.

253
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,890
I love him so much.

254
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,140
So, that person is a man.

255
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,120
Yes.

256
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,590
I guess it's the reason why I wasn't sure
about what gender I'm attracted to.

257
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,450
Until...

258
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,420
Until the day I met Dean
on the orientation day.

259
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,080
It’s him. Isn’t it?

260
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,560
Dean is the one, right?

261
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,290
I’m not sure either.

262
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,390
I've never actually met him.

263
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
All I know is that

264
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,290
when I saw Dean,

265
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,250
my heart was beating

266
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,890
like it was going to explode.

267
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,980
Same here.

268
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,890
Why don’t you go and meet him?

269
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,080
I can take you.

270
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,620
No, you can't!

271
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,490
Oh...

272
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,850
Why not?

273
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,810
I’m scared.

274
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,430
Don’t be scared.

275
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,780
Just pretend that you go to see Team
at the swimming club.

276
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,880
This way, you can find out.

277
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,490
I don’t mean it that way.

278
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,690
I mean...

279
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
I’m really scared.

280
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,090
I’m scared to meet him.

281
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,330
I don’t know why.

282
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,590
It’s okay, Pharm.

283
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,890
Team and I will be there for you.

284
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,890
It’s okay if you cannot go.

285
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,420
You can make all the desserts.

286
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,440
I will make sure to feed Dean.

287
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,720
Make sure you actually do that!

288
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,390
There will be no feeding!

289
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,390
Stop it.

290
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,360
Can I go to see him too?

291
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,890
Team and Manaow…

292
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,430
Join our team. Become a Yaoi fangirl.

293
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,900
You said wouldn’t laugh at me.

294
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,990
I didn’t.

295

Alright, everyone.

296
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,260

snack boxes for the swimming club.

to prepare the materials.
