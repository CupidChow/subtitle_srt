1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,870
All you do is wasting your time 
reading these nonsense novels.

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,490
Why don't you use your time 
to help me with work?

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,150
Do you know how many debtors we've got?

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,990
I don't want to do it.

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,800
You are my eldest son. You're responsible
to continue our family business.

7
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,990
Just do it and you will get used to it.

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,440
And don't be friendly to other people.

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,990
They approach you because of your money.

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,900
But I don't like to use violence.

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,490
Why do you have to hurt them?

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,660
Because they owe us money.
Why do you have to be kind to them?

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,990
I don't want to do it.

14
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,990
If you're not going to do it,
Krit has to do it.

15
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,290
Don't drag my brother into this.

16
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,990
Why not?

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,990
I'm your father. 
Why can't I tell you what to do?

18
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,590
But we do have heart and soul too!

19
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,990
You think you know it all?

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,789
Remember this. If you're still using 
my surname, Ariyasakul, and living in my house,

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,990
just do what I say!

22
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,990
You're useless.

23
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,900
Are you okay?

24
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,990
Are you hurt?

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,260
It will be all right.

26
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,900
I want to swim.

27
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,490
Come in, guys.

28
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,430
Do you want to see me in a bikini?

29
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,980
No one is up yet.

30
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,490
Don, why did you wake up so early?

31
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,990
Just to watch a football match.

32
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,990
Hello.

33
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,490
What are you guys doing here?

34
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,310
I asked Pharm to teach me how to cook

35
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,780
because I want to surprise our parents
when they come back.

36
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,490
Wouldn't it be easier 
if Pharm cooked for our parents?

37
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,990
That's right.

38
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,909
You're going to meet their parents.

39
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,990
Manaow.

40
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,990
Del, where is the kitchen?

41
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,490
That way.

42
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,909
Let's go.

43
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,900
I will make something for you to eat then.

44
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,990
Someone is escaping...

45
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,610
Don...

46
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,909
You're so handsome.

47
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,990
Manaow.

48
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,330
He is our friend's brother!

49
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,490
I'm so sorry. My friend is crazy.

50
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,490
He won't be just a brother for too long.

51
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,910
It smells so nice.

52
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,690
It looks delicious.

53
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,900
Manaow!

54
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,910
I covered my mouth already.

55
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,490
Manaow.

56
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,290
I guess it's too late...

57
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,490
You're nasty.

58
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,990
Manaow.

59
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,490
Dean is still sleeping.

60
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,490
I think someone should wake him up.

61
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm busy. Can you wake him up?

62
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,180
This is what a boyfriend should do. 
We're just outsiders.

63
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,990
I'm busy.

64
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,980
Just go.

65
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,909
Second floor. The innermost room.

66
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,909
Stop pretending that you don't want to go.

67
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,909
Fine. Fine. I'll go.

68
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,990
Hurry up.

69
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,490
Come back soon.

70
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,990
Hurry up.

71
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,990
Before the porridge gets cold.

72
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm here already, Dean.

73
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,130
[Uncle In, where are you going?]

74
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,690
I've got something to do.

75
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,690
I will come back soon. 
Please take care of her for me.

76
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,990
Alin...

77
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,990
Dean.

78
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,990
Dean.

79
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Korn.

80
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,540
This grilled pork is the best.

81
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm not eating it.

82
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,960
Skipping breakfast 
is not good for your health.

83
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,960
Come on. I've bought this for you.

84
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,030
Just one bite.

85
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
Please?

86
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Just one bite.

87
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,740
If you eat this, I will behave.
I won't bother you anymore.

88
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
Please.

89
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,960
One bite.

90
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,740
Come on. I bought this for you.

91
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,040
You eat it!

92
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,760
Don't spit it out.

93
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Swallow it.

94
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Is it delicious?

95
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,040
Here's the drink for you.

96
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,530
Refreshing?

97
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm here anyway.

98
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,840
How about one more bite?

99
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,040
I don't want to eat.

100
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,950
No, I'm not going to eat.

101
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,540
Come on. Please.

102
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,040
You didn't eat breakfast.

103
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,040
Please.

104
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,540
Good boy.

105
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Sticky rice too.

106
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,040
Here.

107
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,040
Korn.

108
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,530
Are you free this Sunday?

109
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,960
Why?

110
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,540
Let's go somewhere together.

111
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,740
Where?

112
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
Let's go to the beach.

113
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,540
Huh?

114
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,040
Don't tell me 
that you never go to the beach.

115
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Have you ever gone to the beach to play?

116
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Never. So what?

117
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Are you serious?

118
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,040
My family doesn't have time to go.

119
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
That's good.

120
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,040
I will be the one to take you around.

121
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,040
Where should we go?

122
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,750
I'll take you to eat prawns, crabs,
and look at all the nice views.

123
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,460
Let's build a sand castle too.

124
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,540
What do you think?

125
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,040
It will be a great trip.

126
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,540
What do you say?

127
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,860
You agree to come?

128
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,540
I'll take that silence as a yes.

129
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,040
I want to go tomorrow.

130
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,330
I cannot wait any longer.

131
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,360
I want to go tomorrow!

132
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,380
Cut the chatter.

133
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,850
Dean, wake up. Everyone is waiting.

134
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,950
Stealing a kiss?

135
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,250
Dean.

136
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Dean!

137
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,750
How come you're here?

138
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,460
Del asked me to come.

139
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,030
Dean.

140
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Dean.

141
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,540
Are you here for real
or am I still in my dream?

142
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm actually here. 
You don't have to do that to prove it.

143
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Dean.

144
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Dean.

145
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,040
Dean...

146
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,250
I'm sorry.

147
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,740
It's okay.

148
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm going to shower. Are you going
to wait for me here or downstairs?

149
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,830
Or we can take a shower together.

150
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,750
I... I will wait downstairs.

151
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
You perv!

152
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,670
Who is perverted?

153
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
What are you doing here?

154
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I'm hungry.

155
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,010
Just a moment. Dean will be done soon.

156
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
What?

157
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,040
How did you wake him up?

158
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Why?

159
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
[Shit.]

160
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
If you go down just like that,

161
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,350
people will notice it.

162
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,540
By the way,

163
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,040
which stage are you guys at?

164
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,140
What do you mean? What stage?

165
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,940
You know about you and...

166
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Dean.

167
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,450
There's nothing at all!

168
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,040
What's wrong with you, Pharm?

169
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,760
Pharm.

170
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,450
Answer me!

171
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:42,960
No!

172
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Pharm!

173
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
Are you full?

174
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
What are you guys doing here today?

175
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,760
I asked Pharm to teach me to cook.

176
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,440
I want to cook for our parents 
when they come back.

177
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Everyone has finished eating, right?

178
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,040
Let's go clean up.

179
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,460
Let me help you.

180
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
Thank you.

181
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,280
Thank you, Manaow.

182
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm so full.

183
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,750
Dad and Mum.

184
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,540
Del, can you help me with this?

185
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Are you guys okay? 
Why are you guys making that face?

186
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,540
Actually,

187
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,340
Dean and Dad are not close.

188
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,050
I remember. Del told us that your parents 
don't come home that often, right?

189
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,750
That's true.

190
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,840
Dean just came to stay with us 
around two or three years ago.

191
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,620
Why?

192
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
The reason is that

193
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,340
our paternal grandmother was not happy 
that our parents got married.

194
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Because my mum was pregnant
while she was studying.

195
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,540
When Dean was born, our grandmother
took him away and raised him herself.

196
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,740
When he was 18 years old, 
our grandmother passed away.

197
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,390
That's why he just came back
to stay with us.

198
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,600
So, Dean is not close to the family.

199
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,250
That's right.

200
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,170
Dad also said that Dean's personality 
is similar to our grandmother's.

201
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,650
Stubborn.

202
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,750
Hardheaded.

203
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,240
It gets worse when he is so cold
towards other people.

204
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,540
But actually, 
their personality is the same.

205
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,440
There's someone who is actually 
colder than Dean?

206
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,740
Our dad is even worse.

207
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,170
You guys replied at the same time.

208
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,160
When these two are together,

209
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,660
the atmosphere gets quiet

210
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,250
and very moody.

211
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,040
My mum said we won't have any conversation
if both of them are in the same room.

212
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
I'll be right back.

213
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,540
I will go with Pharm then.

214
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,950
Come right back here.

215
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,540
Help us clean these dishes.

216
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Dean.

217
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,250
Pharm.

218
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,080
Someone is calling you.

219
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,360
Thank you, Manaow.

220
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,040
Got it?

221
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
[Bro!]

222
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Phoom.

223
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
[Where are you?]

224
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,040
I'm at my friend's house.

225
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,040
Is he your brother?

226
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,950
My younger brother.

227
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,960
Hello.

228
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,960
His name is Phoom.

229
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,460
Who's that?

230
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,140
Pharm's brother.

231
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,540
[Wow. You went to the girls' house
early in the morning.]

232
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,950
Not only girls!

233
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,340
There are other people too.

234
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,370
[So, who is your lover?]

235
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,360
[One of the guys]

236
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,170
[or the ladies that I just saw?]

237
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,750
None of them.

238
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,450
Why are you calling me now?

239
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,240
It must be around 8 pm over there, right?

240
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,050
[Because of you...]

241
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Who's that?

242
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,740
Pharm, we'll just wait for you over there.

243
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
[Who is he?]

244
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,960
What's the matter?

245
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
[Mum!]

246
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,960
Phoom!

247
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Wait.

248
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,410
[Look.]

249
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,410
[This is the guy that you showed me
on Facebook.]

250
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,480
[I remember.]

251
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,490
I...

252
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,490
[Is there anything you want to tell me?]

253
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,490
I...

254
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,490
Pharm.

255
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,490
Look at me.

256
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,490
There's nothing to worry.

257
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,490
Do you understand?

258
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,990
Calm down.

259
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,490
You're doing great.

260
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Mum,

261
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
this is

262
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,490
Dean.

263
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,490
He's my boyfriend.

264
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,990
[I thought you would never tell me.]

265
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,490
[Nice to meet you, Dean.]

266
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,410
[Come on, Mum!]

267
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,410
[Why don't you act in a meaner way a bit?]

268
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,690
[This is too easy.]

269
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,030
But...

270
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,490
Mum, you are okay with this?

271
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,990
[Why shouldn't I be okay 
if you're going to love someone?]

272
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,490
[Whom you love is all up to you.]

273
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,410
[I'm okay as long as you are happy.]

274
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,490
[And that person loves you dearly.]

275
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,990
[Please take care of him for me, Dean.]

276
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,490
I will.

277
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,490
Thank you.

278
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,580
I...

279
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,990
Miss you.

280
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,910
[I miss you too.]

281
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,990
[Why are you crying?]

282
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,490
[You two can come to the States 
and visit me during holiday.]

283
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,490
We will.

284
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,490
Bye-bye.

285
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,490
Bye-bye.

286
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,490
I was stressed too.

287
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,400
My whole body was tense.

288
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,490
Luckily your mum is so kind.

289
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,190
Dean.

290
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,400
I will punish you.

291
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,610
How are you going to punish me?

292
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,490
What are you doing to him?

293
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,490
I...

294
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,490
Let me go talk to Del.

295
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,450
I...

296
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,280
I will go too.

297
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,790
Have you guys ever had Kanom Tom?

298
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,280
I think I have.

299
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,850
It's like a white ball coated
with shredded coconut, right?

300
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,470
That's right.

301
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,500
We are going to make something similar.

302
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,270
You can adapt the recipe.

303
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,990
The first step is mixing flour with water.

304
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,490
Do it slowly.

305
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,410
How much water?

306
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,490
About...

307
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,990
Half.

308
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,490
Then mix them together.

309
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,390
Make sure they are well mixed together.

310
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,490
Then, add more water.

311
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,490
After that we can keep kneading.

312
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,270
Keep doing it.

313
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,410
Pharm, what is that green thingy for?

314
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,410
That is Fragrant Pandan.

315
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,390
When we boil the dough, 
it will have the smell of Pandan leaves.

316
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,490
What if...

317
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,780
We use this powder to cook instead?

318
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,650
Will it work?

319
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,910
Crazy!

320
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,990
This is not a toy.

321
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,490
You're not helping us at all.

322
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,910
I'm lonely. I don't have anything to do.

323
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,990
Why don't you help us?

324
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,290
If you're lonely, come and help me.

325
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,700
Come here.

326
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,780
Quick.

327
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,790
Move!

328
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,400
Move!

329
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,480
I was here first!

330
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,490
You can keep kneading the dough.

331
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,400
After this, we can add some colour.

332
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,900
Actually, I want to use 
natural food colouring.

333
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,790
But for today, let's use this first.

334
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,490
Can I have that colour?

335
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,490
Just add a little bit.

336
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,410
I'm excited.

337
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,490
Just add two drops.

338
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,490
Okay.

339
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,490
That's enough.

340
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,490
Make sure the colour is well mixed 
with the dough.

341
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,410
Keep going!

342
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,990
I'm rooting for you guys here.

343
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,990
That is not how you do it.

344
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,490
Should we add more water?

345
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,990
Can we use this?

346
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:03,990
Yes.

347
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,910
Don't add too much of it.

348
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,400
Okay.

349
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,490
Like this?

350
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,490
Isn't that too little?

351
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,910
That's too big.

352
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,670
I want it to be big.

353
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,490
You have to make them 
into bite-sized balls.

354
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,590
I like it like this.

355
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,490
That's a mess.

356
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,400
It seems like you were spitting.

357
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,090
I don't have any flour left.

358
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,240
My dough.

359
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,980
You guys will make the dough dirty.

360
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,110
If the balls are floating, 
it means they are all cooked.

361
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,090
We can take them out and coat them
with shredded coconut.

362
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,900
We do it while it's still that hot?

363
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,490
Yes.

364
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,400
That's it. Isn't it easy?

365
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,400
So easy.

366
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,410
Because I didn't do anything.

367
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,490
Try it.

368
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,490
Try it.

369
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,410
How is it?

370
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,990
It's so soft.

371
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,740
The filling smells nice too.

372
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,490
The combination between sweet and salty
is perfect.

373
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,010
It's soft and the smell is so nice.

374
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,790
If there were ten of these,
I would eat all of them.

375
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,420
Look at your body.

376
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,490
I know. That's why I look like this.

377
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,250
Pharm.

378
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,910
By the way,

379
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,290
what is this dessert called again?

380
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,400
It's called Kanom Ko.

381
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,490
It's a traditional dessert from the South.

382
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,410
But you were talking 
about Kanom Tom before.

383
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,490
What's that about?

384
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,910
The size of Kanom Tom is bigger.

385
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,410
The filling is made of coconut 
cooked with sugar.

386
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,190
But the filling we made
is only palm jaggery.

387
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,190
I couldn't recognize that the filling 
is made of palm jaggery at all.

388
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,790
You might get fat if you eat too much
as they are just flour and sugar.

389
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,980
You're right.

390
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,640
If I'd cared about that,
I would have been skinny.

391
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,490
Do you want this?

392
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,780
Dean.

393
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,990
Do you want anything?

394
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,490
I think I will get some coffee.

395
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,610
There's some palm sugar left.

396
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,000
Your coffee will smell nice with it.

397
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,990
I think you will like it.

398
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,570
We have desserts too.

399
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,990
You'd better eat this with your coffee.

400
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,490
Calm down.

401
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,490
My hands are dirty. How should I eat?

402
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,790
You used this line before.

403
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,400
We...

404
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,410
Should just leave.

405
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,490
Let's bring these.

406
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,220
We will wait outside.

407
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,690
We cannot stay here any longer.

408
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,490
We're leaving.

409
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:11,989
So...

410
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,489
What's the meaning of this dessert?

411
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,409
Kanom Ko is an auspicious Thai dessert.

412
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,989
It's used in religious ceremonies.

413
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,489
It kind of looks like Kanom Pra Pai.

414
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:29,989
I thought...

415
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,489
It has something to do with love.

416
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,000
You silly!

417
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Dean.

418
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,380
I haven't tried your dessert yet.

419
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,400
Pharm.

420
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,490
What?

421
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,490
Pharm.

422
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,400
What?

423
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,410
What did you do?

424
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,490
Stop being nosey.

425
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,490
Pharm, you hurt me.

426
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,480
Why can't you answer me? What did you do?

427
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,400
Tell me.

428
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,490
I didn't do anything.

429
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,490
Do you have any plans for New Year?

430
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,790
I'm not sure either.

431
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,990
I don't know if I have to visit my mum 
and my brother in the US.

432
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,400
They might come to visit me instead.

433
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,490
Do you have any plans?

434
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,910
I'm still thinking.

435
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,490
But I have to wait and see.

436
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,490
Wait and see?

437
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,290
If the result of the swimming competition
is good,

438
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,490
I want you to join us to stay overnight
on a raft in Kanchanaburi.

439
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,990
Stay on a raft in Kanchanaburi?

440
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,490
I've never been there before.

441
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,490
That's why I really want you to come.

442
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,490
If the result is good,

443
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,990
I can actually go too, right?

444
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,990
Of course.

445
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,280
There will be around 10 people 
from the swimming club.

446
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,280
One raft can accommodate four
to six people.

447
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,490
It will be fun.

448
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,920
But I am not a swimming club member.

449
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,610
No need to worry.

450
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,690
You are the club's president's boyfriend,
aren't you?

451
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,410
Let's go.

452
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,490
Let's get in the car.

453
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,490
Okay.

454
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,540
Let's go.

455
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,810
Come here and let's play.

456
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Come on.

457
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,600
Don't be naughty.

458
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,510
Who's naughty?

459
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,590
Not me.

460
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,600
You're like a kid.

461
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm a grown-up.

462
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,100
Right...

463
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,100
Come here then.

464
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,800
In!

465
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,940
Are you having fun today?

466
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,160
Yes.

467
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,600
If you stay with me, 
you will always have fun.

468
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,660
But if you're with me,

469
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,660
you might have to face
a lot of bad things.

470
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,470
Then you must have me.

471
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,070
Because I will bring 
all the good things to you.

472
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
I will make you happy.

473
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,600
There will be so many things
that we can do together.

474
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,100
Trust me.

475
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,430
You're smiling now.

476
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Will you be my boyfriend?

477
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,220
Are you drunk in seawater?

478
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,600
I am not.

479
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
What's your answer?

480
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,130
I'll give you three seconds.

481
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,520
One...

482
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,510
I will! I will! I will!

483
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,100
We're together now.

484
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,020
You cannot say you're confused

485
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,360
or drunk.

486
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,020
This is not a dream.

487
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,010
If you don't listen to me,

488
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,770
I will punch you!

489
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,690
Wait...

490
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,810
I got it.

491
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,600
I'm so excited. I'm so happy.

492
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,100
I'm so happy.

493
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
I promise.

494
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,520
I will take good care of you.

495
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,190
Promise me.

496
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,050
You will never leave me.

497
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,230
You cannot change your mind.

498
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I promise.

499
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,810
I will not leave you.

500
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,100
I will never let you go.

501
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Forever?

502
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,100
Forever.

503
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Hello, Silp.

504
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,850
[Dean.]

505
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,720
[Are you free to talk?]

506
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,230
Yes.

507
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,980
Is there any update?

508
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,710
[I have some information
about what you asked me.]

509
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,090
You mean...

510
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,320
[Yes. About those two.]

511
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,910
[I couldn't find anything much about Korn.
