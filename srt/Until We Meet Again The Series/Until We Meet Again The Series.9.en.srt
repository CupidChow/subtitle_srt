1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,790
Wrinkles

3
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,990
What are you thinking?

4
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,490
I just stole a kiss

5
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,289
You call that a kiss?

6
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,990
It is. My mouth touched yours already

7
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,990
Korn...

8
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,490
That is what you call a kiss

9
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,990
Why are you like this?

10
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,490
Why?

11
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,490
You stole a kiss from me first

12
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,290
Okay

13
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,990
I surrender

14
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,490
I'm so happy

15
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:56,980
Excuse me

16
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,990
Do you have this book?

17
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,990
Someone already borrowed this book

18
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,490
Is there any other copy left?

19
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,990
There are some left at the Faculty of Business Administration

20
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,990
You can check it out

21
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,990
There is no borrowing history for this book yet

22
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:19,990
Thank you so much

23
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,790
I'm at your faculty library

24
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,990
Here come the drinks

25
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,990
Drinks for you all

26
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,990
Anyone who asks me to buy. Don't forget to pay me back

27
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,490
For you

28
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,490
I won't

29
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,990
Right, Dean

30
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,990
I met Pharm

31
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,990
The one who fed me the dessert

32
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,990
He is so cute

33
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,480
I saw him at the library

34
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,990
I want him to feed me every morning and night

35
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,490
I will eat it all

36
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,990
I miss his dessert

37
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,490
Me too

38
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,790
It’s so sweet

39
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,990
Anyone who tries it will love it

40
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,690
Wait

41
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,490
Where are you going?

42
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,490
I'm going too

43
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,990
I'm hungry

44
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,990
You guys read through other questions first then

45
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,990
I'll come back and ask

46
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:27,990
Wait

47
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,990
You haven't paid me back

48
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,690
No money

49
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,990
He’s taking it for free again?

50
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,990
Let's get back to work

51
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,040
You're making this face again

52
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,990
Did you have weird dreams again?

53
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,990
A bit

54
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,990
You can tell me

55
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,990
It might make you feel better

56
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,290
If there's something that you really want to know

57
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,490
And the answer is right in front of you

58
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,490
But if you know it

59
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,890
There might be a problem comes right after

60
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,390
What will you do?

61
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,480
Then why do you want to know?

62
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,490
Why don't you just let it go?

63
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,990
Don’t find out the answer

64
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,490
Don't look for trouble

65
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,990
But if you let go of this chance

66
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,990
You might have to be curious for the rest of your life

67
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,490
Curious until you die

68
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,990
Let me ask you this

69
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,390
If you know the answer and there will be a problem

70
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,990
What is the problem?

71
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,490
My relationship

72
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,990
My relationship might be ruined

73
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,990
Or it might be better

74
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,490
I don't know how it will turn out

75
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,490
What if…

76
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,990
If it makes your relationship turns bad

77
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,990
Will you let go of him?

78
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,990
Never

79
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,490
I will never let him go

80
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,990
That's it

81
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,990
Then just find out the answer

82
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,990
You said there might be a problem

83
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,490
That also means it might not happen

84
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,990
It's 50:50

85
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,990
Also

86
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,480
Even there is a problem

87
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,990
You will never let him go anyway

88
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,490
Why do you have to worry?

89
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,490
What you said is right

90
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,990
Sometimes you're just too scared

91
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,990
Maybe it's because he is so important to you

92
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,990
So, you're afraid of losing him

93
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,490
That's why you're so scared to find out the answer

94
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,490
Damn

95
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,690
You can actually say something nice

96
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,290
Asshole

97
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,980
I just helped you

98
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,990
I will go to the convenience store now

99
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,990
Get intertrade textbook for me too

100
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,990
So, we can continue our study

101
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,990
Okay

102
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:18,990
Also

103
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,990
Trust me

104
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,290
Your boyfriend won't let you go too

105
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,490
See you

106
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,190
I'm at your faculty library

107
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,490
Did he go back already?

108
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,490
Dean

109
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,590
Are you okay?

110
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:31,990
Dean

111
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,090
Someone might see us

112
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:58,790
Pharm

113
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,090
I love you

114
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,650
I love you too

115
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,790
Hi Pharm

116
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,490
We just talked about you

117
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,990
Where did you guys just go?

118
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,990
I don't know why he is so cute

119
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,990
Go back to your seat

120
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,490
So stingy

121
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,990
He is being protective

122
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,990
You should understand

123
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,650
We cannot even play with him

124
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,490
You're right...We cannot even play with him

125
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,290
Can you pass this textbook to Win?

126
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,990
I'm leaving

127
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,490
See you guys later

128
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,490
You can go alone

129
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,490
Leave Pharm here

130
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,490
He's coming with me

131
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,480
Overprotective...

132
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,310
Don't forget to do your work

133
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,490
Um...

134
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,490
Pharm

135
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,990
If you break up with my friend

136
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,990
I am here for you

137
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,190
Shut up

138
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,490
See you

139
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,990
See you, Pharm

140
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,790
Bye bye

141
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:31,990
Don't listen to them

142
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,090
I said bye bye. Why can't you reply us?

143
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:36,490
See you

144
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,190
I'm not talking to you

145
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,490
You're teasing him

146
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,490
My car is here

147
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,990
These past few days

148
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,290
You seem stressed

149
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,490
Is there anything I can help?

150
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,490
I'm fully charged already

151
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:43,990
Let's go

152
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,490
It's time to go home

153
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,190
Drive safely

154
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,190
Okay

155
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,190
You too

156
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,510
Sin

157
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,030
Can I ask?

158
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,810
Yes

159
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,110
Why did you ask me to find out about these two people?

160
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,710
I dream

161
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,030
You dream about someone, right?

162
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,250
Sorn told me about it

163
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,530
I've been dreaming for so long

164
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,250
Dreaming about someone

165
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,950
I'd been searching for that person

166
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,770
I finally found him

167
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,190
Since then

168
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,310
I dream more often

169
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,410
More details

170
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,670
My dreams also become longer

171
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,210
I

172
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,210
And that person

173
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,530
We found out that our dreams

174
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,930
Are connected

175
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,290
In our dreams

176
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,910
Our names are

177
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,610
Korn

178
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,630
And Intouch

179
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,250
I'm quite sure that

180
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,030
One of them

181
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,370
Committed a suicide

182
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,890
Now

183
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,790
I am more certain

184
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,070
That I

185
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,630
Was Korn

186
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,370
Who shot himself on that day

187
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,310
Sin

188
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,010
Can I look at the photo?

189
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,870
Just a few photos

190
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,270
Quick

191
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:43,950
Fine

192
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,950
Look at the camera

193
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,430
Ready?

194
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,270
Give me a cool pose

195
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,090
One. Two. Three

196
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,550
Finish?

197
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,450
Wait

198
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,510
One more, please?

199
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,160
Stand still

200
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,010
I wasn't prepared before

201
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,290
One. Two. Three

202
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,450
Done

203
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,390
That's it, right?

204
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,170
Develop the film for me too

205
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,350
The person in this photo is Intouch

206
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,900
He committed a suicide when he was 18

207
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,360
One month after this photo was taken

208
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,130
Committed a suicide…

209
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,610
When he was 18

210
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,310
You misremembered

211
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,830
Two people that you asked me find

212
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,410
They both committed suicide

213
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,410
On the same day

214
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,650
Just to be clear

215
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,530
Korn committed a suicide first

216
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,090
Then Intouch followed

217
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,210
Intouch Chatphokin

218
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,930
Does his surname sound familiar to you?

219
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,690
Let me ask you again

220
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,150
Do you know Antika Chatphokin?

221
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,520
Do you know your mom's maiden name?

222
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,070
Alin Chatphokin

223
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,790
Antika is your maternal grandmother

224
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,950
The person in the photo is your grandmother's brother

225
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,710
He is your granduncle

226
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,510
Intouch

227
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,530
Pharm

228
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,230
Korn

229
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,370
Yes?

230
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,510
It won’t be long…

231
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,850
Before we can be together

232
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,130
Yes

233
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,130
It won’t be too long

234
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,030
Your umbrella

235
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,770
Is too big and too heavy

236
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,990
My umbrella is the best option

237
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,710
Let me take care of you

238
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,620
But if you’re with me

239
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,410
You might have to face a lot of bad things

240
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,410
Then you must have me

241
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,390
Because I will bring all the good things to you

242
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,110
I will make you happy

243
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,070
There will be so many things that we can do together

244
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,570
Trust me

245
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,460
I love you

246
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,469
Don't

247
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,489
Korn!

248
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,110
I love you

249
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,240
Korn

250
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,890
Fuck you, Korn!

251
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,110
Korn!

252
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,610
You bastard!

253
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,690
You bastard!

254
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,830
You bastard! Fuck you!

255
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,130
Pharm

256
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,810
Pharm, wait for me

257
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,610
Pharm

258
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,090
Dean

259
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,350
Can I ask?

260
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,480
Can I stay with you tonight?

261
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,590
Yes?

262
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,720
I will tell you everything

263
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,490
I think you can wear these pants

264
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,050
But

265
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,590
I don't have any shirt that will fit you

266
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,990
Thank you

267
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,890
I’m going to take a shower then

268
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,390
Okay

269
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:17,990
Dean

270
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,490
Why didn't you sleep on the bed?

271
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,890
Because you're bigger than me

272
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,890
And my bed is so small

273
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,990
I'm worried that you will feel uncomfortable

274
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,720
I will sleep on the sofa

275
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,520
Don't

276
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:38,650
It's okay

277
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,290
I'm here

278
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,490
I'm here with you

279
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:17,290
Hello

280
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,530
Del! Wait!

281
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,330
If I know more about Intouch

282
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,490
Will it change our relationship?

283
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,330
It won't

284
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,930
I will never change
