2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,840
You’re much older than your brother.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,920
You have to take care of him.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,390
Of course, Mum.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,300
I promise you,
I will take a good care of him.

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:19,550
This is the son of Chatphokin family.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,680
I’m sure when he grows up,

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,190
he will be so handsome and smart.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,470
I think he’s sleepy now.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,710
He’s sleepy.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,450
Let him sleep.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,850
Look.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,690
Your dad is so crazy about his son.

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,480
Of course.

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,290
Slowly.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,670
Time to sleep.

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,390
Do you want to sleep?

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,530
It's time to sleep.

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,990
I will sing for you.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,470
Do you want to listen?

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,390
Why are you staring at me?

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,120
Your dad is so obsessed with his son.

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,840
Just a little bit.

24
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,150
Oh, right.

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,190
An.

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,010
You can sing him to sleep.

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,670
Me?

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,590
Yes.

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,350
Okay.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,420
Look at him.

31
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,180
I'll sing for you.

Pharm.

34
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,140
Dean.

35
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,110
Why did you wake up already?

36
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,730
What are you doing?

37
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,310
I…

38
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,050
I made tofu and minced pork soup.

39
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,350
Chili paste.

40
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,230
And right now

41
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,890
I’m making mung bean rice crepe.

42
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,210
I already prepared our breakfast.

43
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,620
We just have to wait for the rice to cook.

44
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,150
Is there anything I can help?

45
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,400
You can help me put sugar
mixed with sesame on top of these.

46
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,650
How…

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,650
Where should I put it?

48
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,030
How exactly should I do it?

49
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,310
Just on top of the crepe.

50
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,130
Make sure you sprinkle the sugar evenly.

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,170
I got this.

52
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,470
Okay.

53
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,269
Is this enough?

54
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,410
Yes.

55
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,130
Okay. That’s enough.

56
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,079
By the way,

57
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,380
these colours are so nice.

58
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,260
How did you make all these colours?

59
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,940
Orange is made from carrot.

60
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,090
Green is made from pandan leaf.

61
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,010
Yellow is made from pumpkin.

62
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,770
And

63
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,070
blue is made from butterfly pea flower.

64
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,380
Wow.

65
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,090
You’re amazing.

66
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,610
What’s wrong?

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,540
The bean.

68
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,890
The mung bean on the shelf.

69
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,530
Dean!

70
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,870
Don’t tease me.

71
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,250
I was shocked at that time.

72
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,810
You just ran away
because you were shocked?

73
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,780
Don’t ever run away from me again.

74
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,370
If you do,

75
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,760
I will throw this at you.

76
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,590
Stop it.

77
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,140
Help me to pack this.

78
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,820
It’s done?

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,830
Yes.

80
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,970
Okay.

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,820
They all look delicious.

82
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,230
Done.

83
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,470
Thank you.

84
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,470
You're welcome.

85
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,960
Can I eat it now?

86
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,700
Yes, you can.

87
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,230
Are you sure?

88
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,570
Of course.

89
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
Is it good?

90
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,280
You have to try it yourself.

91
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,970
Nope.

92
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,570
Are you going to eat it now?

93
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,880
Or you want me to do something else first?

94
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,480
Huh?

95
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,159
Dean.

96
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,650
Stop teasing me.

97
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,830
Why do you like to tease me?

98
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,790
Everyone I know told me that

99
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,960
if I like someone,
I will tease that person.

100
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,030
But for someone that I love…

101
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,930
I think

102
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,750
what I did to you is not even enough.

103
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,409
Dean.

104
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,150
Stop it.

105
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,870
You’re a criminal.

106
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,790
We have to go to the temple later.

107
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,940
This coconut is so sweet.

108
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,450
Stop it.

109
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,350
Stop playing.

110
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,720
Let’s take a shower.

111
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,010
Go now!

112
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,540
It’s all over your mouth.

113
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,080
Wipe it for me.

114
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,310
Go take a shower now.

115
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,870
Brush your teeth too.

116
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,250
Wow.

117
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,580
What’s this?

118
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,110
Japanese Hamburg Steak.

119
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,970
But I put some climbing wattle in it too.

120
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,830
That’s very unique.

121
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,830
Mixing it with climbing wattle
makes the dish unique.

122
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,170
I used minced beef

123
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,890
mixed with a little bit of flour
and Japanese tofu.

124
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,230
Normally, it’s usually mixed
with onion and carrot.

125
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,870
But I changed it to climbing wattle.

126
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,250
It tastes quite nice.

127
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,670
Try it.

128
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,000
I will start eating then.

129
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,890
Okay.

130
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,470
It’s delicious.

131
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,539
I actually don’t like
to eat climbing wattle.

132
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,090
But it tastes better
when I mix it with Hamburg.

133
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,570
Do you like it?

134
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,080
It’s good.

135
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,720
When I was young, my dad always took me
and my brother to offer food to the monks.

136
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,260
My mum always woke me up
to help her to cook.

137
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,470
Is that why you like to cook?

138
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,370
Yes.

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,990
What were you like when you were a kid?

140
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,480
When I was young, my grandmother
took me to offer food to the monks too.

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,980
She was quite fierce and strict.

142
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,460
I had to wake up very early.

143
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,650
I kept whining when I had to wake up.

144
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,550
She always punished me.

145
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,650
By the way,

146
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,100
what was your father like?

147
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,740
My dad?

148
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,650
My dad was very kind.

149
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,480
He was always in a good mood.

150
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,600
He loved his family dearly.

151
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,870
Actually,

152
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,710
when I’m with you, I have the same
feeling as when I was with my dad.

153
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,680
You think I’m kind?

154
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,010
Like I'm a family man?

155
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,300
No.

156
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,870
Being kind to me is the only time
that you give off that vibe.

157
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,690
Why?

158
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,950
I’m joking.

159
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,910
I mean the overall vibe is similar.

160
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,530
My dad can be quite serious sometimes.

161
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,940
Oh, right.

162
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,090
I just knew that I have a grandpa.

163
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,960
I also have an uncle
whom I haven’t seen for a long time.

164
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,770
I will probably see him when
my mum comes back.

165
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,870
The monk is here.

166
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,350
Please.

167
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,760
I will give you my blessing.

168
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,460
After this, you two
should give the offering

169
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,760
and do the water-pouring ceremony.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Now let's pour the water
and get a blessing.

171
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,260
Strength and trust

172
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,700
will help both of you
to overcome the problem.

173
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,200
There are both good and bad things
that tie you two together.

174
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,700
Forgiveness is important.

175
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,240
Don’t forget this.

176
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,370
[Forgiveness?]

177
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,260
[Forgive who?]

178
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,370
[Who made Intouch angry?]

179
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,230
[And who is angry at Intouch?]

180
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,030
[What should I do?]

181
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,790
[Actually,]

182
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,510
[I'm having nightmares more often]

183
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,530
[that I began to hyperventilate.]

184
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,370
[When I told Dean,]

185
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,900
[he almost moved in to live together.]

186
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,130
[I actually want him to stay.]

187
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,680
[He makes me feel safe.]

188
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,510
[He makes my heart warm.]

189
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,760
[I have no hidden agenda.]

190
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,220
[I told him to go home.]

191
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,160
[But he still insisted.]

192
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,290
[He said if I want him to go home,]

193
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,370
[I must go back with him.]

194
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,530
Where are we going?

195
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,620
This is not the way home.

196
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,230
You will be okay.

197
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,670
Take it easy.

198
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,250
It's okay.

199
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,480
I…

200
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,390
I…

201
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,590
I…

202
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,790
You don’t have to force yourself.

203
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,250
If you cannot bear it,

204
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,760
I can take you home now.

205
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,530
Let’s go.

206
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,710
Pharm.

207
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,310
Look at me.

208
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,950
No one in this house can hurt us.

209
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,410
Okay?

210
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,290
What about…

211
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,890
Dad?

212
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,590
Intouch’s dad…

213
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,570
He passed away a long time ago.

214
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,010
But An,

215
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,780
Intouch’s sister,

216
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,230
she still lives.

217
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,270
She got divorced years ago.

218
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,270
Before you’re going to meet her,

219
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,850
I have to tell you something first.

220
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,030
About Alin,

221
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,840
Intouch’s niece.

222
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,520
Alin got married.

223
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,530
She has three children.

224
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,890
Alin got married already?

225
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,030
Yes.

226
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,930
All of her children
already entered university.

227
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,230
Her eldest son is studying in
the Faculty of Business Administration.

228
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,040
Her second son is studying Architecture.

229
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,590
Her youngest daughter is Arts.

230
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,550
You’re a Business Administration student.

231
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,550
Don is an Architecture student.

232
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,590
Del is an Arts student.

233
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,270
Yes, Pharm.

234
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,890
Alin is my mum.

235
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,350
And An.

236
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,360
She is my grandmother.

237
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,850
It’s okay.

238
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,880
Calm down.

239
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,230
So, tell me.

240
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,920
My good boy.

241
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,790
Who are you?

242
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,750
Pharm…

243
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,310
I am Pharm.

244
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,410
Yes.

245
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,750
You are Pharm.

246
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,830
But today,

247
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,250
you are here for one reason.

248
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,980
I brought you here

249
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,730
so that Intouch

250
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,990
can meet his sister.

251
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,030
Also,

252
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,030
I brought you here

253
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,470
because I want you to meet my grandmother.

254
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,970
I want to introduce you as my lover.

255
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,890
Dean…

256
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,090
I’m confused.

257
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,610
What makes you confused?

258
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,170
I don’t know if I’m nervous
because I will meet An,

259
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,740
or it’s because I will meet
your grandmother.

260
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,010
There’s nothing to be nervous about.

261
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,980
Let’s go.

262
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,110
Are you ready?

263
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,600
I’m ready.

264
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,100
Let's go.

265
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,930
I think my grandma is in the kitchen.

266
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,160
I didn’t tell her that we will come today.

267
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,270
Go to her.

268
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,130
Do whatever you want to do.

269
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,600
I will wait for you here.

270
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,310
An.

271
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,110
[Dear Moon.]

272
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,970
Give him rice. Give him soup.

273
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,830
Give him a copper ring.

274
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,630
[So, my little brother can wear.]

275
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,570
[Give him an elephant. Give him a horse.]

276
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,490
So, my little brother can ride.

277
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,950
Give him a chair.

278
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,630
So, my little brother can sit...

279
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,840
In.

280
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,410
You are In, aren't you?

281
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,420
I miss you, sister.

282
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,720
I miss you so much.

283
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,450
I miss you.

284
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,100
I miss you so much.

285
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,210
In,

286
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,570
don't leave me again.

287
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,110
-Promise me.
-I promise.

288
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,790
I miss you so much.

289
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,780
Dad, look at his doe eyes.

290
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,230
You're crying too much these days.

291
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,210
Dad…

292
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,320
When did great-grandpa pass away?

293
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,300
He passed away a long time ago.

294
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,900
I can’t even remember.

295
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,160
But Mum…

296
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,120
I mean your great-grandma.

297
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,380
She passed away ten years ago.

298
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,790
Then,

299
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,460
who are you living with?

300
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,180
Because Alin…

301
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,380
You can call her as your mum too.

302
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,780
Yes.

303
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,240
You can call her as your mum.

304
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,980
You are his boyfriend anyway.

305
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,320
Since mum is not here,

306
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,280
you are living alone?

307
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,970
Yes, I live alone.

308
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,080
But my grandchildren
always come to see me.

309
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,100
I’m not lonely at all.

310
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,960
If…

311
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,660
If I come to see you too,

312
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,340
will that be okay?

313
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,330
Of course.

314
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,970
Pharm,

315
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,380
we always welcome you here.

316
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,800
If you miss me, please come and see me.

317
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,830
I will come with him to see you.

318
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,760
Okay.

319
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,930
I will take him to visit you more often.

320
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,920
On the weekend,

321
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,930
I'll take him here so we can eat together.

322
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,230
Okay, grandma?

323
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,910
Yes.

324
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,260
Dean.

325
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,440
Let’s eat now.

326
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,360
Grandma made so many dishes for us.

327
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,040
Let’s go.

328
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,240
You should eat a lot.

329
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,960
Okay.

330
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,830
-Try this.
-Hello, grandma.

331
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,350
Sit.

332
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,900
How come Pharm is here?

333
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,920
I saw only Dean’s car,
so I thought he came alone.

334
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,610
So, today…

335
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,090
Are you here to introduce
your boyfriend to grandma?

336
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,290
Dean slept over at Pharm’s yesterday.

337
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,700
I didn’t know he will take Pharm
to meet you today too.

338
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,610
Dean.

339
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,960
I told you not to tease him.

340
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,260
I didn’t do anything, grandma.

341
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,920
Right, he did not.

342
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,840
Does that mean Pharm let you do it?

343
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,860
I did not.

344
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,400
Dean just did it...

345
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,020
Did what?

346
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,940
I think I’m going to faint.

347
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,560
Why do you like to tease him?

348
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,760
Nothing happened, grandma.

349
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,720
He didn’t do anything.

350
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,140
What did you say to grandma?

351
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,890
Why is she not against
your relationship at all?

352
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,690
I didn’t do anything.

353
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,560
He is so cute. How can I not accept him?

354
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,320
Your brother.

355
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:21,240
He actually told me about this
since the first day we met.

356
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,480
He’s a real man.

357
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,440
I know.

358
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,570
You try to get her on your side
before our parents come back, right?

359
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,190
Huh?

360
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,800
You're tricky.

361
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,430
What about your trip with Pharm
to Kanchanaburi?

362
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,790
Is there any hidden agenda?

363
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,110
It’s time for you to confess.

364
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,020
I just want…

365
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,050
A reward from him.

366
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,140
Because I won a medal
in the swimming competition.

367
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,000
That’s why I’m taking him with me.

368
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,770
You embarrassed him now.

369
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,380
Stop talking now.

370
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,720
Bring more plates.

371
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,190
I’ll get them.

372
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,670
Glasses too.

373
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,820
You should help your sister.

374
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,320
She's getting them already.

375
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,679
You should eat more.

376
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,639
You seem happy today.

377
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,239
I'm alright.

378
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,820
You're alright.

379
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,650
You’re so sweet.

380
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,920
Here's the rice.

381
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,440
For you, grandma.

382
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,429
Try it. Does it taste good?

383
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,130
I made all of them by myself.

384
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,350
Delicious?

385
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,250
It's delicious.

386
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,570
Put them in carefully.

387
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,100
Win, help me check all the belongings.

388
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,270
Dean.

389
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,600
Pharm.

390
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,800
You’re here.

391
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,970
Mr President.

392
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,640
You’re abusing your authority.

393
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,540
I want to bring my girlfriend with me too.

394
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,120
Go. Get on the bus.

395
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,410
Ouch! Win!

396
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,150
Stop being nosy.

397
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,900
Why are you guys so sweet?

398
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,160
Stop it, Pharm.

399
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,630
Pharm…

400
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,380
Since you guys became a couple,

401
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,770
you've become more sadistic
just like Dean.

402
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,610
What?

403
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,450
Why are you teasing them?

404
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,590
You’re late!

405
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,830
Get on the bus!

406
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,090
-Stop complaining.
-Go!

407
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,300
What the heck.

408
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,020
Win.

409
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,890
Just let them have their sweet moment.

410
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,210
Dean.

411
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,330
Your bag.

412
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,050
Don’t listen to them.

413
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,920
Let’s get on the bus.

414
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
Okay.

415
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,770
In an hour, we will stop
at the gas station.

416
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,510
After that, we will go straight
to River Kwai Bridge.

417
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,280
We will have lunch
before we go to the resort.

418
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,020
You guys always practice swimming.

419
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,820
Aren't they sick of water yet?

420
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,090
They like it.

421
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,170
They won't get tired of it.

422
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,440
Do they even notice that other people
are so jealous of them?

423
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,390
Why don’t I have someone to feed me too?

424
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,610
What are you looking at?

425
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,990
What’s the matter?

426
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,230
Fruits.

427
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,750
I want someone to feed me.

428
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,270
Team.

429
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,620
What?

430
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,700
Can you feed this lonely person?

431
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,240
No way!

432
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,440
Come on!

433
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,870
Just feed me.

434
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,600
What the hell?

435
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,890
It’s so hot.

436
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,930
Good thing that I brought my hat.

437
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,080
Nice, isn’t it?

438
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,710
Let’s go take photos at the bridge.

439
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,390
Let's go.

440
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,980
Wait. I want to look around first.

441
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,700
Come here.

442
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,350
Where should we go?

443
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,470
Here.

444
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,540
Put on your hat.

445
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,760
Thank you.

446
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,880
Let’s go take photos.

447
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,620
Let's go.

448
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,890
-Do you want me to take it for you?
-Yes.

449
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,290
I want to take a photo here.

450
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,290
Let's go over there. The view is nicer.

451
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,520
-Dean.
-Yes?

452
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,350
I have a question.

453
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,640
You and Win.

454
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,790
How long have you guys known each other?

455
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,870
Since high school.

456
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,730
I went to a banquet at the beach
with my grandmother.

457
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,720
I was bored.

458
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,040
So, I went to swim instead.

459
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,040
I met Win at the pool.

460
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,540
Back then,

461
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,490
we were the only kids around the same age.

462
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
I dared him to compete with me.

463
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:40,150
It turned out that we were going
to the same high school.

464
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,450
You knew him quite a long time already.

465
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,160
Did he already have so many tattoos then?

466
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,080
Since eleventh grade.

467
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,230
He was inspired by the movies.

468
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,320
He asked me to get tattoos with him.

469
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,720
You got a tattoo?

470
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,050
Yes.

471
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,510
I didn’t like the idea at first.

472
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,650
But when I saw the real tattoos,

473
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,290
I thought it was not bad.

474
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,080
I got a tattoo at a hidden spot.

475
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,050
Do you want to know where?

476
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,450
Yes, I want to see it.

477
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,510
Where is your tattoo?

478
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,470
It’s right here.

479
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,880
Dean!

480
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,740
I'll show it to you.

481
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,310
I don’t want to see it anymore.

482
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,310
Don’t be shy.

483
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,290
Mr President.

484
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,540
Let’s take photos as fan service.

485
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,110
-Come on.
-You’re so...

486
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,900
Let's go.

487
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,200
They've gone to take photos.

488
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,170
We should take ours.

489
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,990
Let them go.

490
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,990
One, two, three!

491
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,590
Are you taking that many photos
for next year too?

492
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,750
I’ll keep them in my album.

493
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,280
I can sell your photos.

494
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,100
Are you having fun?

495
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,450
I'm having so much fun.

496
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,440
Let’s go somewhere else together again.

497
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,060
This trip has just begun.

498
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,890
You’re already planning our next trip?

499
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,450
I can’t do that?

500
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,980
Next trip,

501
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,710
let’s go visit your mum
in the States together.

502
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,410
Okay.

503
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,090
Let's go in.

504
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,770
Mew.

505
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,670
Are you okay?

506
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,430
I'm fine.

507
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,710
You got carsick?

508
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,390
We will be staying at the area
near the dam.

509
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,830
Two people in each room.

510
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,030
Each room has its own toilet.

511
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,220
You guys can decide
who will stay with who.

512
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:39,430
You can come to the lobby
if you want to buy something to eat.

513
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,810
Okay?

514
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,090
You guys can take a rest now.

515
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,600
Or you guys can go swim at the dam.

516
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,900
But be careful.

517
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,970
That's it.

518
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,390
See you guys later.

519
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,980
Enjoy!

520
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,770
The furthest room is ours.

521
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,990
What? Who said I'm going to stay with you?

522
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,670
Let's go.

523
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,970
-I’m staying with Mew.
-No.

524
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,630
Walk!

525
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,580
Can I go in?

526
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,880
Of course.

527
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,290
Why do you like to eat ice-cream?

528
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,480
I like to eat all the sweet things.

529
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,410
But it looks too sweet.

530
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,320
Korn.

531
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,690
Just one bite.

532
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,530
Come on.

533
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,850
Quick.

534
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,190
I…

535
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,300
[Next episode]

536
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,290
I saw In...

537
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,900
If you hide under the blanket like this,

538
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:11,150
how am I supposed to get my reward?
