2
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,480
Dean.

3
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
I told you.

4
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,280
No need to hurry.

5
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,930
I can wait.

6
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,660
I think...

7
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,840
We should go ‘eat’.

8
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,140
Go ‘eat’?

9
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,440
I mean...

10
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,450
Eat breakfast.

11
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,630
Before the food gets cold.

12
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,660
I don’t have a chance to eat the omelet?

13
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,840
I’ll make it for your next time.

14
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,340
It won’t be burnt next time, right?

15
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,340
I promise. I guarantee.

16
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
It will be super yummy.

Pharm.

21
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,340
It’s okay.

22
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,339
I’m here.

23
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,640
It’s okay.

24
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
Let’s start eating.

25
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,340
Let me get this for you.

26
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,930
It's delicious.

27
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,330
Try this soup too.

28
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,140
I want this pen.

29
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,530
You can't have it!

30
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,600
- Please?
- Hey!

31
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
Let me use it for a sec.

32
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,950
Stop it, fatty.

33
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,850
What now?

34
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,470
No comment?

35
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,340
Hello.

36
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,340
Hello.

37
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,240
Pharm.

38
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,540
How did you get here today?

39
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,640
By myself.

40
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,340
What’s the matter?

41
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Pharm.

42
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,840
I forgot.

43
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
I want to ask you a favor.

44
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
Can you make a sandwich for me?

45
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
I think my drama club will finish late today.

46
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,530
Sure.

47
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,030
I’ve got nothing to do anyway.

48
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,530
What fillings do you want?

49
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,530
You’re the best!

50
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,300
So...

51
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,330
Can I have

52
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,970
boiled eggs, Ham, Cheese, Tobiko,

53
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,409
Tuna, Salad,

54
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,250
Caviar, Quail eggs...

55
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,520
Stop it!

56
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,530
That’s too much.

57
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,030
Just the first two then.

58
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,840
Anything that’s easy for you.

59
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,740
Can I have it too?

60
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,170
Win is so tough on me.

61
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,340
He told me to practice until 8 PM.

62
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,340
I want a chicken breast sandwich.

63
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,040
Please?

64
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
He won’t have time to rest then.

65
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,840
- So, it’s not free.
- What?

66
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,880
It’s not free?

67
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,340
It’s okay, I’ll pay for you.

68
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,340
Hey, what's this?

69
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,980
I owe you.

70
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,720
Me too.

71
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,410
I'll pay!

72
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,330
Same.

73
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,340
I’ll pay you later.

74
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
Fine, I’ll make them for you guys.

75
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,340
- It’s so nice to have a chef as a friend.
- Do your work!

76
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,670
Which question are we up to now?

77
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,830
Pharm.

78
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,429
[PY Cute Boy: That smile though! Who is he texting?]

79
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Dean looks so good when he smiles.

80
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,340
He looks good when he smiles.

81
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Why doesn't he smile more often?

82
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,200
What do you think he was looking at?

83
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
What makes him smile like this?

84
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,100
Maybe he’s talking to a girl?

85
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
Maybe he’s watching something funny.

86
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,450
You think someone like Dean will watch something funny?

87
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,270
Just imagine Dean watches funny dog clips or something.

88
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,970
I get goosebumps already. So weird!

89
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,240
I can't imagine.

90
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
But Dean doesn’t have any girlfriend.

91
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,340
I don’t think he talks to any girls.

92
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,910
I’m curious. What can make him smile?

93
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,340
I’m also curious.

94
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,840
No girlfriend doesn’t mean he’s not seeing anyone.

95
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,300
Hey,

96
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,990
Dean is not seeing anyone.

97
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Win told me.

98
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
All he does is practicing swimming.

99
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,220
How can he have the time to find a girl?

100
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,640
I thought you both said you will protect me.

101
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,140
Why do I feel that you two are pushing me to him?

102
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,140
I always keep this in mind that

103
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,180
I will protect you if someone approaches you.

104
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,740
But I will support you if you want to flirt!

105
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,340
Flirt? Who?

106
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,330
Is it not true?

107
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,840
Not true. Jeez, Team.

108
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,340
Really?

109
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,340
Look into my eyes.

110
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,350
Stop it!

111
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,820
No!

112
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,140
Do you guys still want sandwiches?

113
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,840
Yes!

114
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,550
Someone is changing the topic.

115
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,600
Let's continue.

116
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Where’s the pen?

117
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,760
Can I have the black one?

118
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,010
It's so dirty, you can have it.

119
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,810
I don’t want it now.

120
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,390
Give me that one.

121
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,690
Do you have a pencil?

122
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,130
What?

123
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,130
- A pencil.
- I also want a pencil!

124
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,420
How about coconut milk jelly?

125
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,810
That's not bad.

126
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
But it’s kinda sloppy.

127
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,430
Hello Aum and Giffy.

128
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,940
Can I use the kitchen today?

129
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Sure!

130
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,150
No one is using it today.

131
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,150
Oh right!

132
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,150
That reminds me.

133
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,440
A Drama club member just contacted us.

134
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,080
There’s an event?

135
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,150
Yes.

136
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,850
Drama club and Film club will produce a short movie.

137
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,650
There’s a scene that the leading actress has to do food carving and Thai desserts.

138
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,050
What do you think?

139
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,650
Dej and Giffy can teach food carving, right?

140
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,150
I’m not free.

141
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,150
There’s only Dej.

142
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,940
As for Thai food, I think you’re the best.

143
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,230
Everything you make is delicious.

144
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,650
I think for filming,

145
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,650
the food should look nice.

146
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,850
But easy to make or else the actress won’t be able to do it.

147
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,850
What should we teach?

148
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,150
How about Thai Steamed Dumplings?

149
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,650
Chor Muang?

150
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,650
Just a second.

151
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,650
We can prepare the filling.

152
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,650
And the actress can shape the dumpling.

153
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,290
I think that will look nice.

154
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,870
Yeah!

155
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,000
Hold on.

156
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,650
Here.

157
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,150
Look!

158
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,150
Let’s make this.

159
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,650
Beautiful.

160
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,650
Easy to make.

161
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,740
Looks appetizing.

162
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,020
We can just teach them how to shape it.

163
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,420
No need to find other complicated materials.

164
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,150
It seems easy to make.

165
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,150
So...

166
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,150
Pharm.

167
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,270
Can you do me a favor?

168
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,650
Next week, they will know who will get the lead role.

169
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,650
She can start practicing right away.

170
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,330
Okay, no problem!

171
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,640
So, there are Dej and Pharm.

172
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,650
The reward for this work

173
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,650
is two coupons for dinner at a hotel by the Chao Phraya River.

174
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,650
It’s a full-course meal.

175
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,150
It’s so expensive!

176
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,150
The actor from the drama club gave them to us for free.

177
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,150
But it will expire soon.

178
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,150
I think he knows that we love to eat so he pays us with free meals.

179
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,150
Interesting, right?

180
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,800
Yes.

181
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,720
Thank you for your help!

182
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,710
Sure.

183
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,910
You’re the best!

184
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,340
Everyone gets your own role already, right?

185
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,500
Memorize your line.

186
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,340
Use your highlighter to underline your dialogue.

187
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,280
Manaow.

188
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,380
Manaow.

189
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,650
Pharm.

190
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,570
Pharm.

191
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,850
Excuse me.

192
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,110
Pharm.

193
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,330
I’m so hungry.

194
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,840
You know me.

195
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,650
You’re the best.

196
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,330
This is yours.

197
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,830
Thank you so much.

198
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,730
As long as I have you,

199
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,740
I won’t starve to death.

200
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,980
You’re overreacting.

201
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Just eat it.

202
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,520
Can I eat it too?

203
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,910
Oh Alex!

204
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,650
Every time Manaow comes to the club,

205
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,650
she always has delicious food.

206
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,250
You're Pharm,

207
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,650
Manaow’s friend, right?

208
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,950
Yes.

209
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,950
He’s the one who made Luem Kluen that I brought to the club last time.

210
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,650
He’s the one.

211
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,010
I remember.

212
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,010
It’s very delicious.

213
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,150
Thank you.

214
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,530
I was thinking to order them for my friends at the movie set.

215
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,920
I don’t think I can make that much by myself.

216
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,150
I just make them for my friends.

217
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,850
Pharm.

218
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,050
Yes?

219
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,650
Do you have a boyfriend?

220
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,640
I’m sorry?

221
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,150
Do you have a boyfriend?

222
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,570
If not,

223
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,930
I will make a move.

224
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,150
You like guys?

225
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,650
I’m bisexual.

226
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,020
Both girls and guys are good for me.

227
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,170
I’m very honored that an actor like you is interested in me.

228
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,650
I don’t have a boyfriend yet.

229
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,230
So that means,

230
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,150
I can start flirting with you?

231
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,660
I don’t have a boyfriend.

232
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,650
But that doesn’t mean that I want an actor to be my boyfriend.

233
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,650
So...

234
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,150
I have something to do.

235
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,650
I will have to excuse myself.

236
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,650
I will give this to Team.

237
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,650
I have to go now.

238
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,290
Bye!

239
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,150
Alex,

240
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,150
when you said girls are okay for you too,

241
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,150
do you mean it?

242
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,650
Yes.

243
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,150
But...

244
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,650
I’m picky.

245
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,140
You will pick me?

246
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,650
Let’s start, everyone!

247
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,750
Alex.

248
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,150
You’re a stone, come here.

249
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,150
You act as a stone, right?

250
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,650
Come.

251
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,960
The stone stands here.

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,650
Okay, sure.

253
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,150
Tell me when to act.

254
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,160
You don’t have any line.

255
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,020
You, come here.

256
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,300
Just pretend you don’t know what to do.

257
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Stone, are you okay?

258
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,340
- Yeah.
- Alright then.

259
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,610
Bend down.

260
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,020
You can show your face just a little bit.

261
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,580
Act like you don’t feel anything.

262
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,020
Start walking.

263
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,400
Action!

264
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,650
You're finally here.

265
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,150
I’m so hungry.

266
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,340
Why are you sitting here alone?

267
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,330
Because of the seniors.

268
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,340
They told us to get out.

269
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,150
Sit down!

270
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,830
What are you doing?

271
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,820
People will take our photos again.

272
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,330
There’s no one here.

273
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,650
Most importantly,

274
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,340
it’s not real.

275
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,340
Of course.

276
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,650
You’re worried

277
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,340
that Dean will misunderstand you, right?

278
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,830
Who are you looking at?

279
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,300
You know it. Why do you have to ask?

280
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,800
Dean left since 7PM.

281
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,340
Maybe he’s at home already.

282
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,840
Really?

283
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,340
Stop.

284
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,330
Stop making that face.

285
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,840
It’s okay, darling.

286
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,830
Come again tomorrow.

287
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,330
By the way,

288
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,830
it’s so late already.

289
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,540
How will you get home?

290
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,200
Your car is still in repair, right?

291
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,650
There are so many cars in the queue.

292
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,040
The day after tomorrow, it will probably finish.

293
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,330
Don’t worry.

294
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,850
I'm gonna leave.

295
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,650
It’s quite unsafe at night.

296
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,650
Okay.

297
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,650
Let me know when you reach home.

298
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,830
I’m sorry for making you go home late.

299
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,970
It’s okay. Don’t worry!

300
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,150
Thank you.

301
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Don’t forget to eat it.

302
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,330
Okay.

303
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,340
Bye bye.

304
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,780
Dean,

305
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,150
you didn’t leave yet?

306
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,330
Not yet.

307
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,340
You’re going back now, right?

308
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,330
Let’s go.

309
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,330
I’ll drive you home.

310
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,150
I don’t want to bother you.

311
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,150
You’re not bothering me.

312
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,650
So...

313
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,650
Were you busy today?

314
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,270
I called and texted you all day.

315
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,650
But there’s no reply.

316
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,780
You called me?

317
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,650
Yes.

318
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,960
I’m sorry.

319
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,530
It’s okay.

320
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,840
If you’re going back home late,

321
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,340
you can call me.

322
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,650
I can drop you off.

323
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,650
But...

324
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,150
I thought you’ve got something to do today.

325
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,360
My business...

326
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,140
Is you.

327
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,290
Me?

328
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,150
Yes.

329
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,960
I planned to drive you home.

330
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,650
It will be too late for you to wait until 9PM.

331
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,650
But you cannot leave the club early every day to drive me home.

332
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,380
You are the president of the swimming club.

333
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,650
You will look irresponsible.

334
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,600
If I don’t leave my club early,

335
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,150
that means I can drive you home, right?

336
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,650
My car will be done soon.

337
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,940
By the way,

338
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,650
someone posted your photo on FB today.

339
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,070
They said you’re talking to your girlfriend.

340
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,830
Who is she?

341
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,150
Is she cute?

342
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,450
Well,

343
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,840
I'm seeing someone.

344
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,820
Really?

345
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,930
Do you want to know who?

346
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,830
Here.

347
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,930
Have a look.

348
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,470
There’s only one person that I chat with privately.

349
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,840
[Pharm]

350
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,320
Dean!

351
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,980
Delete this picture!

352
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,770
[Hello Monday]

353
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,730
No way!

354
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,150
What a waste.

355
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,150
I was looking at this picture this morning.

356
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,150
I couldn’t hold my laugh.

357
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,650
Don’t tell me that

358
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:27,150
you were smiling in the photo because you were looking at this.

359
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,650
That's right.

360
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,370
Dean!

361
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:39,840
Let’s go.

362
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,330
It’s time to go home.

363
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,930
Okay.

364
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,150
Have you eaten yet?

365
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,650
Not yet.

366
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,650
I made a sandwich for you.

367
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,490
Thank you for dropping me off.

368
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,190
Did you forget anything?

369
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,990
I…

370
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,490
I made a sandwich for you.

371
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,990
If…

372
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,870
Thank you.

373
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,490
Dean.

374
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,990
Yes?

375
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,990
Tomorrow...

376
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,990
Yes?

377
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,490
Do you want to have breakfast together again?

378
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,060
Well...

379
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,740
I’d love to.

380
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,990
So...

381
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,990
See you around 6.30AM.

382
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,490
See you at 6.30AM.

383
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,490
Dean!

384
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,990
No need to hurry.

385
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,990
Yes sir.

386
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,490
Drive home safely.

387
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:20,990
Hey!

388
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,990
You keep smiling. Is there any good news?

389
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,990
There’s nothing.

390
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,490
Okay, guys.

391
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,490
We’re all here.

392
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,490
Let me introduce all of you.

393
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,290
These two are from the drama club.

394
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,490
Who will come to learn cooking with us this week.

395
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,490
Here’s Manaow.

396
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,490
She plays the lead actress’s sister.

397
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,490
She’s a first-year student.

398
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,490
Hello. I’m Manaow.

399
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,880
I cannot cook.

400
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,950
My future is in your hands.

401
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,290
Here’s Del.

402
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,490
She is the leading actress.

403
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,490
She’s also a first-year student.

404
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,990
Hello. I’m Del.

405
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,790
I can cook simple dishes.

406
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,490
But I never do food carving or make Thai food.

407
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,490
I hope you guys can help me.

408
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,990
Today we will learn how to make Chor-Muang.

409
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,490
Pharm will be our teacher today.

410
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,990
Anyway,

411
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,290
I’ll let you take care of this.

412
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,990
I will go to that group.

413
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,990
Good luck!

414
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,480
Pharm.

415
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,490
Let me introduce Del to you.

416
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,990
She was introduced already.

417
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,490
Not like that.

418
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,490
Her name is Del.

419
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,890
Her full name is Ronnaporn

420
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,490
Wongnet.

421
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,490
She is Dean’s sister.

422
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,490
You know my brother?

423
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,990
Well...

424
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,990
We talk sometimes.

425
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,990
Manaow!

426
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,990
Don’t be naughty.

427
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,150
Let’s start making this.

428
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,250
Okay.

429
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,990
This seems difficult.

430
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,680
It’s not that hard.

431
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,800
It just needs a lot of practice.

432
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,990
Do you know?

433
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,290
Chor-Muang has a long history since King Rama II.

434
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,490
What’s the filling for Chor-Muang?

435
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,190
Why are there chilis too?

436
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,490
Isn’t it supposed to be sweet?

437
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,590
What filling?

438
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,790
Even though it is categorized as dessert,

439
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,790
Chor-Muang is actually savory.

440
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,480
The meat filling is seasoned with three herbs and spices.

441
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,690
What are they?

442
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,990
They are garlic, coriander, and pepper.

443
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,490
Mixing together.

444
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,660
Usually Thai food will include these three main ingredients.

445
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,490
They make the food smell nice, right?

446
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,990
Yes.

447
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,490
Let’s begin.

448
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,880
So, here are the main ingredients.

449
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,990
Minced pork,

450
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,990
Preserved Turnip,

451
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,990
Fried garlic,

452
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,490
Palm sugar,

453
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,990
And the herbs and spices.

454
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,990
Not that much ingredients.

455
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,990
Right.

456
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,490
Do you think I can do it?

457
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,490
We’re in this together.

458
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,020
The show must go on, Del.

459
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,910
This is the filling for Chor-Muang that I made.

460
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:15,990
Smells nice.

461
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,230
And these

462
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,490
are tweezers for Chor-Muang.

463
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,490
There are two types.

464
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,490
That's for you.

465
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,490
And for you.

466
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,990
We'll use this one first.

467
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,410
This is how you do it.

468
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,490
We will pinch on the top like this for the first layer.

469
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,670
This is the first layer.

470
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,990
The second layer.

471
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,980
Do it similarly as the first layer.

472
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,990
Like this.

473
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,950
You look professional.

474
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,990
You have to keep practicing.

475
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,490
After that,

476
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,990
we will use this one

477
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,990
to do the fourth layer.

478
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,490
For the fourth layer,

479
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,490
make the petal more outward.

480
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,800
So, it will look prettier.

481
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,990
Amazing!

482
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,420
So cool!

483
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,120
Manaow.

484
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,170
What are you doing?

485
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,490
I can’t hold it in anymore.

486
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,490
Pharm,

487
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,490
will you marry me?

488
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,990
Manaow!

489
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,490
What are you doing?

490
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,490
Pharm,

491
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,990
just marry me.

492
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,420
You’re so perfect.

493
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,990
I can take care of you for the rest of your life.

494
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,990
Just cook for me.

495
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,670
Enough already.

496
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,730
Let's try to do it, guys.

497
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,490
Let's see.

498
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,390
Start now?

499
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,990
Yes.

500
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,990
Let’s do this together.

501
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,990
Use this tweezer first.

502
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,990
Here is how you do it,

503
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,990
like I just taught you.

504
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,990
Pinch at the center first.

505
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,990
Don’t pinch it too deep.

506
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,990
If it’s too deep, the filling might come out.

507
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,990
Is this okay?

508
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,990
That’s good.

509
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,990
Now you can begin the second layer.

510
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,650
I think I understand your feeling now, Manaow.

511
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,990
Pharm, will you marry me?

512
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,990
Marry me doesn’t mean I can make Chor-Muang for you.

513
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,990
Come on.

514
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,160
We have to keep practicing.

515
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,490
We will start flirting with you now.

516
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,490
I told you to focus on Chor-Muang.

517
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,990
Can I begin my last layer now?

518
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,990
You have to change the tweezer first.

519
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,490
Change myself first?

520
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,490
No!

521
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,460
After this, we put them in the steamer.

522
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,830
We can taste it later.

523
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,490
[Dean: You’re making Chor-Muang?]

524
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,990
[Dean: Teaching members from the drama club, right?]

525
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,490
[Pharm: How do you know?]

526
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,990
[Dean: I saw my sister’s FB.]

527
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,989
[Pharm: I’ll give it to you later.]

528
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,989
Let me see.

529
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,489
Yours is good, Del.

530
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,780
Manaow, let me see.

531
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,170
Here.

532
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,980
Look at this.

533
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,690
So pretty.

534
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,100
Why does it look like this?

535
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,989
Well...

536
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,400
It’s just too big.

537
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,989
What are you smiling at?

538
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,989
Who are you talking to?

539
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,190
Before putting your nose into my business,

540
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,489
how about your love life?

541
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,590
You’re nosy as well.

542
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,990
I’m not blind.

543
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,180
He’s so stubborn.

544
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,670
Be nice to him!

545
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,990
He’s our club member.

546
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,990
I know.

547
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,990
Let’s go.

548
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,990
Other people are waiting.

549
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,970
Hey, Dean.

550
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,190
Do you know that you smile more often?

551
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,180
You look so much happier.

552
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,940
How do I look before?

553
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,940
You looked cold-hearted.

554
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Always grumpy.

555
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,340
Never respond to anything.

556
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,070
Scolded at everyone.

557
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,390
Also,

558
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,540
you seemed like you were looking for someone all the time.

559
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,130
But you stopped doing that now.

560
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,310
You found that person, right?

561
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,350
Do you want to compete?

562
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,370
Of course!

563
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,190
Pruk,

564
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,730
can you time us?

565
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,790
Sure!

566
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,340
Freestyle. Back and forth.

567
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,640
Get ready.

568
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,320
What do you think?

569
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,530
That's fast.

570
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,790
Team!

571
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,790
Just in time.

572
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,980
For you to share with your members.

573
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,490
What's this?

574
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,090
I thought this is just for me.

575
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,380
He just ditched everything once he got the food.

576
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,490
What are they doing?

577
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,210
Dean and Win are competing.

578
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,890
They are so cool!

579
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,390
Their strokes are perfect.

580
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,790
They're really fast too!

581
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,710
Dean.

582
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,710
That's 54.64 seconds.

583
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,290
Win.

584
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,990
That's 54.80 seconds.

585
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,420
I missed just a little bit.

586
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:18,790
What?

587
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,600
Let's warm-up.

588
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,390
Hello, guys.

589
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,690
Give me.

590
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,590
Yes?

591
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,110
That towel.

592
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,890
It's for me, right?

593
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,710
I think.

594
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,700
If we compete again,

595
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,710
you can break a world record.

596
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,970
By the way,

597
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,890
what's that?

598
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,310
Chor-Muang.

599
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,490
I saw this for the first time.

600
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,490
It looks nice.

601
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,490
Pharm,

602
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,490
can you feed me?

603
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,090
My hands are dirty.

604
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,790
Quick!

605
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,890
You're using your friend.

606
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,290
I'm hungry!

607
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,590
I didn't say anything!

608
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,020
You boss him around.

609
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,820
Like you don't!

610
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,750
Feed me too, please.

611
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,090
Feed this guy too.

612
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,290
Just do it.

613
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,980
I ship them!

614
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,090
Just enjoy yourself.

615
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,630
Pretend that we're not here.

616
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,820
Yeah, go ahead.

617
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,140
They're so cute!

618
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,340
[Dean is smiling!]

619
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,270
[Arghhhhhhhhh!]

620
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,190
[Dean is actually smiling!]

621
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:00,690
[His target is Pharm? He is the most beloved one from the Faculty of Economics!]

622
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,490
Good job!

623
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,980
This looks great.

624
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,830
You guys can bring them home.

625
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,830
That's good!

626
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,930
I want this one and this one.

627
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,790
I'll pack them in the box.

628
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,530
By the way,

629
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,240
Del, can I ask you?

630
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Normally, when Dean is at home.

631
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
What is he like?

632
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,710
Dean?

633
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,920
He is quiet.

634
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,890
Like this.

635
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,890
He's also strict.

636
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,890
Strict too?

637
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,590
I thought...

638
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,310
At home,

639
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,990
he would be kind to the siblings.

640
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,090
Actually,

641
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,200
maybe it's because we were raised separately.

642
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,090
We met when we are already grown up.

643
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,770
So, he is more like a father.

644
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,200
To tell the truth,

645
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,620
I'm closer to Don.

646
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,080
Normally, we would talk during breakfast.

647
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,190
But lately, he doesn't join us that often.

648
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,510
He greets us and just leaves.

649
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,110
Maybe he's busy.

650
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,550
How are you?

651
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,800
How’s your dessert going?

652
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,990
It’s delicious.

653
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,980
You made this?

654
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,150
We all help each other.

655
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,950
As for the decoration,

656
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,990
the credits go to these two girls.

657
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,750
Great!

658
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,920
Our short film will go perfectly.

659
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,090
Right?

660
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,460
Of course, it will.

661
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,190
Because Manaow and Del are in it.

662
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,270
If I have another movie that is related to food,

663
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,270
I will invite you to act with me.

664
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,590
I’m not good at acting.

665
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,150
It’s better for me to work behind the scenes.

666
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,790
Behind the scene?

667
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,990
Like,

668
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,990
delivering food?

669
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,750
You and that president of the swimming club are close?

670
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,350
I saw you feed him.

671
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,630
Alex,

672
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,990
Pharm also fed Team and Win.

673
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,440
I see.

674
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,990
So, there's a special service?

675
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,980
Can I ask for that too?

676
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,990
Can you feed me?

677
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,990
Please.

678
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,090
Here.

679
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,420
Is it good, Alex?

680
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,960
It's good.

681
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,430
Very delicious.

682
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,790
I told you before.

683
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,390
My answer is still the same.

684
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,970
Hope you enjoy eating this.

685
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,990
Thank you for the food.

686
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,830
I'm gonna leave then.

687
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,750
Bye.

688
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,430
So?

689
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,990
What?

690
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,990
There're many girls at this table.

691
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,890
Why is he only interested in Pharm?

692
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,890
Why are you so attractive?

693
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,890
What are you talking about?

694
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,790
Right. Not attractive at all.

695
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,490
Not towards anyone except...

696
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,880
Stop.

697
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,390
Except that one person.

698
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,390
Enough!

699
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,290
I'm not talking to you anymore.

700
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,090
Are you shy?

701
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,090
I am not.

702
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,110
It's so good!

703
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,790
You're very good at cooking.

704
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,780
I want to open a restaurant.

705
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,090
I want to re-open my mom’s restaurant.

706
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,690
Then,

707
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,620
why are you studying economics?

708
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,790
My dad, who passed away, wanted me to choose this major.

709
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,790
I also like this major.

710
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,790
By the way,

711
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,690
are you a mixed-race?

712
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:15,900
Just a quarter.

713
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,640
My grandfather is a foreigner.

714
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,190
Me and my mom’s side of the family are not that close.

715
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,490
My mom never told me

716
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,150
which country my grandfather is from.

717
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,080
Look at my face.

718
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,340
From some angle, I don’t look like a Thai.

719
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,790
Don’t you think so?

720
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,680
I like it.

721
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:42,990
Thank you.

722
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,390
You have a scar on your temple?

723
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,600
Oh...

724
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:58,990
It’s a birthmark.

725
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,290
I have one too.

726
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,290
It’s here.

727
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:07,260
It's quite faded.

728
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,490
Let me get you some more.

729
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,990
My mom told me that

730
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,190
old people believe that birthmarks are scars from a past life.

731
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,980
When I see my birthmark on my temple,

732
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,310
I cannot stop wondering

733
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,490
what I did in my past life that gave me this birthmark.

734
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,870
One day my brother, Phoom,

735
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,490
he went to watch a movie.

736
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,990
And he said the reason that I have this birthmark is because

737
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,490
I shot myself in the head.

738
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,490
Korn!

739
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:48,490
Korn, wake up.

740
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,580
Wake up.

741
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,750
Pharm.

742
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,150
It's okay.

743
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,490
It's okay.

744
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,490
I’m here.

745
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:49,270
I love you.

746
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:50,600
It's okay.

747
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,290
Don't do it!

748
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,650
I'll clean it.

749
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:31,780
Manaow,

750
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,790
what are you doing?

751
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,790
I'm finding something to read.

752
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,790
Do you know which play are we going to do?

753
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,710
There are so many novels.

754
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,890
BL novels too?

755
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,100
Look. Look.

756
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,460
This one is new. They have it too?

757
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,990
This is meb e-book.

758
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,980
There're novels and cartoons.

759
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,860
You can download it for free or buy some novels here.

760
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,310
I spend so much money on this.

761
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,750
Can I try?

762
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,750
This one is so good!

763
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,750
I like this one.

764
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:10,750
It's good!

765
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,190
Enjoying it, right?

766
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,690
I think you should download it.

767
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,390
I'm serious.

768
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,390
It's great!

769
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,610
Dean,

770
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,460
You don’t have to pick me up anymore.

771
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,500
You’re not in a hurry today?

772
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,960
No.

773
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,060
I will eat breakfast with you two.

774
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,860
Sorn.

775
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:53,660
Hey, Dean.
