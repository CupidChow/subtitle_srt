1
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,500
Now push

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,200
Push again

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,640
Just a little bit more

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,460
That's great

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,720
Hold that push

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,880
You're almost there. Keep pushing

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,520
I can see his head now

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,340
Just a little bit

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,720
Keep pushing

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,720
You’re doing great

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,520
He's coming out now

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,140
I can see his head

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,140
One more big push

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,660
Just a little bit

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,080
One last time

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,440
One. Two. Three!

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,520
Good job

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,520
He’s out

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,960
It's a boy

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Congratulations. You did great

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Look at his face

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,060
You’re Kard Trivinij, right?

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,780
Yes

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,120
It's a boy

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,380
His weight is 3000 gram

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,259
He's a healthy baby

27
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,380
May I?

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,640
Of course

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,480
What is his name?

30
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,900
Pharm

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,720
P. H. A. R. M

32
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,540
Pharm

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,500
Okay

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,120
I will take him to his mom for breastfeeding

35
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,060
Dad

36
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,540
How long are you going to stare at him?

37
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,900
I haven’t seen him for almost 10 years

38
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,060
I cannot look at him?

39
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,060
Uncle…

40
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,820
You can call me uncle Krit

41
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,700
I think you look similar to your mom

42
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,020
You don’t look like Kard at all

43
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,300
Just relax. I won’t bite

44
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,800
I think we should get to know each other more before we go to see your grandpa

45
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,140
The last time I met you was at your dad’s funeral

46
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,320
You went to his funeral too?

47
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,140
Of course

48
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,920
He’s my brother

49
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Your grandpa was there too

50
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,920
When we were there, you went to do something else

51
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,980
So, we didn’t talk

52
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,920
That's too bad

53
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,400
My mom never tells me about dad’s side of the family

54
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,420
I want to know but I don't dare to ask

55
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,840
I’m not surprised

56
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,560
Your dad hates your grandpa

57
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,860
He was very stubborn and full of pride

58
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,700
When he got married, he decided to use your mom’s surname instead

59
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,180
What a man

60
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,500
Why did he hate grandpa so much?

61
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,300
Grandpa caused him to lose his most respectful person

62
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,180
My mom told me about you though

63
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,320
She said you’re the one who named me

64
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,860
Me?

65
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Yes

66
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,180
Pharm means strength

67
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,580
And my brother, Phoom, means land

68
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,400
I remember now

69
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,400
I came up with the name Phoom

70
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,480
As for Pharm

71
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,400
Your another uncle chose that name

72
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,720
Another uncle?

73
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,420
You have another brother?

74
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,620
I do

75
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,660
How come you’ve never mentioned about him?

76
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
At least you should have brought him to meet us

77
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,760
He passed away already

78
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,260
He died at a very young age

79
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,380
I don’t have any brothers left

80
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,200
Let’s start eating

81
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,300
Do you want to order anything else?

82
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,180
No, thank you

83
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,960
What’s that?

84
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,560
Candy

85
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,360
This one

86
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,860
Are you going to eat it?

87
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
If not

88
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,920
Can I eat it?

89
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,140
No, you cannot

90
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,060
So stingy

91
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,580
Did you even think before you reply?

92
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,420
Kard, you're a glutton

93
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,960
This candy

94
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
I got it from my special person

95
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,100
Who?

96
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,700
I won’t tell you

97
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
You have a secret?

98
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
You guys!

99
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,500
How’s your homework going?

100
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,560
I don’t want to do it

101
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,460
I have to find the meaning of our family members’ names

102
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,000
Look at our names. They all start with K

103
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
Our names are alike

104
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
This is embarrassing

105
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,860
Why?

106
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,420
I think it’s good

107
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,480
People will know immediately that we are brothers

108
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,800
It’s not cool at all

109
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,460
If I have a child

110
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,500
His name won't start with K

111
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,200
Just wait and see

112
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,860
When you have a child

113
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,640
I will be the one who name him

114
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,820
How come?

115
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
My child will not have K in his name

116
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,900
Pharm

117
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,240
Pharm

118
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
Pharm?

119
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,100
Yes

120
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,560
Pharm means strength

121
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,540
Your children will have the strength to overcome obstacles

122
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,480
If you have a son

123
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Name him Pharm

124
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,080
Bro

125
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,920
Why did you get to choose the name?

126
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,360
Kard, you must have two sons

127
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,980
I will name another son

128
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,420
You choose Pharm, right?

129
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,080
Pharm starts with P

130
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,280
How about Phoom?

131
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,360
How’s that?

132
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,980
Phoom and Pharm sound alike too

133
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,380
One syllable too

134
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,380
One syllable again?

135
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,020
Damn it

136
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,600
I can assure you

137
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,160
If I have sons, they will not have these two names

138
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,500
Why not?

139
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,280
You won’t listen to us?

140
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,860
Why?

141
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,680
What are you going to do?

142
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,920
Stop

143
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,500
Why? Are you going to let us name it or not?

144
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,120
Krit, don’t tease your little brother

145
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,220
Stop attacking me

146
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,760
Are you going to pick these two names or not?

147
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,380
Dad

148
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,880
Why don’t you go in?

149
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,140
He didn’t even use my surname

150
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,740
Dad…

151
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,520
I don't think Kard wants to see me

152
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,340
Give this to Pharm

153
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,820
Tell them it’s from you

154
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,820
Korn was the one who chose this name, Pharm

155
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,640
Back then...I, Korn and Kard. We were talking

156
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,160
Korn said if Kard has a son, he wants to name him Pharm

157
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,740
Pharm means strength to fight obstacles

158
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,240
Where are you, Pharm?

159
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,220
I'm on the way to Sin's house

160
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,220
Wait for me there. I will go there soon

161
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,300
We're here

162
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,780
You can take him inside first

163
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
Grandpa usually stays at the back of the house

164
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,720
He's probably sleeping now

165
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,260
You can walk around the house first

166
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,220
That’s grandpa’s working and reading room

167
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,819
You can have a look in case you want to read something

168
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,720
I'll be right back

169
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,000
Okay

170
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,440
Okay

171
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,660
Where’s Pharm?

172
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
Downstairs

173
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,460
Dad

174
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
What’s your older brother’s name?

175
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,160
Why did you ask?

176
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,960
I want to know

177
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,740
Your children names start with S

178
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,780
Pharm’s side starts with P

179
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,440
Uncle Kard. His name starts with K too

180
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,040
So, I’m wondering what is your older brother’s name

181
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,080
You're relentless

182
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,080
You’re not giving up, aren’t you?

183
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,040
Korn

184
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,320
Your uncle's name is Korn

185
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,980
I'm more certain

186
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,280
That I...

187
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,640
I was Korn

188
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,200
Who shot himself on that day

189
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,580
Then

190
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,380
What was his cause of death?

191
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,280
Why do you want to know?

192
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,760
He committed suicide, right?

193
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,760
Why did you try to hide that?

194
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,000
I could only find out about Intouch

195
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
I couldn’t find any information about another person

196
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,580
Why not?

197
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,520
I only found out about his cause of death

198
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,760
Other details and photos

199
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Someone forbids them

200
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,460
Who is he?

201
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,220
Can you give me the name?

202
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,800
I’m not allowed to say

203
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,180
I've got to go

204
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,560
Even I used my dad’s name, I still couldn’t access to the information

205
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,760
Whatever

206
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,580
I’m not trying to hide anything

207
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,880
I want to know too where did you get those two names

208
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,900
I…

209
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,380
I want you and Sorn be happy

210
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,120
You don’t have to worry about this kind of issue

211
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,140
Korn and Intouch

212
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,760
They were lovers

213
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,460
Just like you and Sorn

214
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,320
Homosexuals

215
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,580
Grandpa forbid them to be together and that led to their suicides

216
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,620
I don’t want you to hate your grandpa

217
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
How can I hate grandpa?

218
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,280
Well...

219
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
What are you reading?

220
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,420
It seems hard to understand

221
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Can you stop bothering me?

222
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,560
Yes, sir

223
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
I will stop bothering you now

224
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,240
Korn

225
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,660
Korn

226
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,360
Korn

227
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,700
You said you will stop bothering me

228
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,140
Dad

229
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,860
Korn

230
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,040
Korn

231
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,580
Just imagine

232
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,580
What?

233
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,920
If we die and we’re born again

234
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,660
Do you think we will find each other?

235
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,720
Of course

236
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,660
Really?

237
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes

238
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,380
I will keep searching until I find you

239
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,660
It won’t be long…

240
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,280
Before we can be together

241
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,800
Yes

242
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,360
It won’t be too long

243
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,620
I want to go on the floating raft

244
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,580
When we have the freedom

245
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
I will take you to wherever you want to go

246
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,080
Just a few photos

247
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,640
Quick

248
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,340
Fine

249
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
Look at the camera

250
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,040
Ready?

251
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,600
One. Two. Three!

252
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,560
Korn

253
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,840
Korn

254
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,440
I love you

255
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,900
Korn, don’t leave me

256
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,400
Stay with me

257
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,180
Wake up

258
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,160
I love you

259
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,620
I love you

260
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,260
You said you'd never leave me

261
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,860
I love you

262
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,100
What’s that?

263
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,460
I made this for you

264
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,040
Isn’t it cute?

265
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,180
This

266
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,180
We can use it to hang the key

267
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,200
Korn and In?

268
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,660
Are you sure?

269
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,660
Thank you so much, Antika

270
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,520
I will take care of this

271
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,960
Thank you

272
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
I want to be alone

273
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,740
What are you doing? Be careful

274
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,720
Have you met Pharm yet?

275
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,140
Krit

276
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,780
Yes?

277
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,980
Get Korn’s photo for me

278
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,640
Okay

279
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,460
Dad, I will go out and look for Pharm

280
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,180
Go find him

281
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,440
Dad!

282
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,940
Our housekeeper said Pharm went outside with a gun

283
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,260
What?

284
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,800
I know where Pharm is going

285
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,219
Hello

286
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,159
Dean, where are you?

287
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,679
I’m going to your house now

288
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,020
Pharm is gone

289
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,659
What?

290
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,460
He's gone

291
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,500
I let him stay inside the house

292
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
When I came back, he wasn’t there anymore

293
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,739
Dean

294
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,780
Listen to me

295
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,639
I found a photo album and an old box on the floor

296
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,639
I think Pharm saw them

297
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,659
Do you still remember that you told me to find two people?

298
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,659
I remember

299
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,920
I asked you to find out about Korn

300
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,580
And Intouch

301
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,780
Korn is my uncle so that means he's Pharm's uncle too

302
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,680
The person who’ve been searching for is my relative

303
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,100
I've gotta go

304
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,700
Hello, Pharm

305
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,100
Dean

306
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,080
My good boy

307
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,500
Where are you?

308
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,540
You know where

309
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,520
I'm at our place

310
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,160
I'll go there and pick you up now

311
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,100
Pharm

312
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,500
Hello, Pharm

313
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,880
Pharm

314
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,580
Our place...

315
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,520
Where is that?

316
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,420
That place!

317
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,520
What do you think?

318
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,080
Are you seriously going to buy a room here?

319
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,060
Yes

320
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,220
It's a new building

321
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,040
There’s an elevator too

322
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,180
My dad hates condo

323
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,700
He said it's like we're buying air

324
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
We don't own an actual land

325
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,820
My dad thinks that way too

326
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,220
That seems to suit us though

327
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,940
Because we are eloping and always on the run

328
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,940
Let’s take a look inside

329
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,340
(No entry without permission)

330
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,140
I'm sorry

331
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,540
Why are you saying sorry to me?

332
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,660
I'm not your dad

333
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,460
It's none of your business!

334
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,000
Dad!

335
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,440
Come here!

336
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,040
Don't hurt him

337
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,440
We will always be together

338
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,460
I will be here with you

339
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,600
Pharm

340
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,600
Dean

341
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,100
Let’s go back

342
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,520
Let’s go back to our home

343
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,720
You’re a liar

344
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,120
You bastard!

345
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,140
I'm sorry

346
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,420
What if I choose to leave you first?

347
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,540
I'm leaving you

348
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,880

Dean, where are you going?

350
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,320
We are free from each other now

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,060
We don’t have to love each other anymore
