1
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,920
Mommy and Grandma

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,260
Where is uncle In?

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,700
Uncle In is travelling

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,460
He’s going somewhere really far

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,540
When is he coming back?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,700
Will he get to eat your stewed pork and eggs with us?

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
Also, sour curry that you made

8
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,060
I’m not good enough to be your dad

9
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,120
But I love you so much

10
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,680
The red thread will bring both of you

11
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,720
To meet each other again

12
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,760
In this life, you two couldn't be together

13
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,260
But in your next life

14
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
You two shall meet one another again

15
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,820
Korn

16
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,580
Please take care of him

17
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He is my beloved son

18
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,480
What’s that?

19
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,480
Candy

20
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,340
Are you going to eat it?

21
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,140
If not, can I eat it?

22
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,000
No!

23
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,659
This one

24
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,120
I got it from my special person

25
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,000
Why?

26
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,300
Are you going to let us name your son or not?

27
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,800
Krit!

28
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,180
Stop teasing your brother

29
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,200
Stop attacking me!

30
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,860
Will you let us name your son or not?

31
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Just be whatever you want to be

32
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,120
Do you understand?

33
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,390
Pharm

34
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,170
Dean

35
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,330
Let’s go back

36
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,610
Let’s go back to our home

37
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,650
I love you, In

38
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,650
Remember this

39
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,950
I love you so much

40
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,370
You’re a liar

41
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,650
How dare you?

42
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,210
How dare you killed someone that I love?

43
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,450
You bastard!

44
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,450
You’re a liar

45
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,450
You're a bad person

46
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,670
You lied to me

47
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,450
You’re a liar

48
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,450
You bastard!

49
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,950
You’re a liar

50
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,070
Pharm

51
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,450
I’m sorry

52
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,950
I’m sorry, Pharm

53
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,450
Do you know

54
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,610
How I feel?

55
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,610
When I saw you died right in front of my eyes?

56
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,950
No matter how many times I called you

57
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,610
You didn’t reply

58
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,450
You left me

59
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,990
You left me here when you already made a promise that we'd always be together

60
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,790
You said you'd never leave me

61
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,950
Why did you do this to me?

62
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,650
My heart was dead

63
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,630
I couldn’t breathe

64
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,450
My world was falling apart

65
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,450
I didn't have the strength to go on

66
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,410
We loved each other

67
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,670
But you were the one who hurt me the most

68
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,250
It’s not that, Pharm

69
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,410
I love you

70
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,970
I love you so much

71
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,890
I’m sorry

72
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,250
Please

73
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,790
What if I choose to leave you first?

74
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,390
I’m leaving you

75
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,450
In, don't do this

76
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,370
Don't take him away from me

77
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,450
Please, don’t do this

78
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,750
I’m right here

79
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,950
I am here now

80
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,950
I’m your Dean

81
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,590
I’m your Dean

82
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,690
It’s okay

83
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,350
It’s okay now

84
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,950
There’s nothing to be afraid of

85
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,950
It’s okay

86
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,230
It's okay

87
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,050
Dean

88

Pharm

89
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,950
Dad

90
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:37,950
Korn!

91
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,230
What's going on?

92
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:40,950
Come here!

93
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,270
How many times did I tell you?

94
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,570
Don't get involved with this kid

95
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,450
No!

96
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,950
No!

97
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,450
Go away!

98
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,950
I told you to go away!

99
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,450
Pharm, it’s okay

100
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,950
It’s okay

101
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,950
It’s okay, Pharm

102
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,950
Pharm, it’s okay

103
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,450
It’s okay

104
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,950
It’s okay

105
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,950
That guy

106
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,450
That guy

107
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,450
I don’t want it

108
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,090
I don’t want to see it anymore

109
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,470
Calm down, Pharm

110
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,950
Go away!

111
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,590
Korn!

112
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,450
No

113
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,230
Korn!

114
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,070
Don’t!

115
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,450
Korn!

116
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,150
Pharm

117
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,770
Pharm

118
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,950
Wait

119
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,130
Let me deal with this

120
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,970
No one is going to separate you two

121
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,090
Intouch

122
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,910
Your parents were in pain for such a long time

123
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,450
This room…

124
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,950
No

125
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,450
The whole building

126
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,050
Dad bought it for both of you

127
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,890
We make sure that it will always stay the same

128
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,930
We always maintain it, just like how it was for the past 30 years

129
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,190
Everything in this box

130
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,950
Dad kept it for you

131
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,630
Dad always loves and misses you, Korn

132
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,510
Since you were gone

133
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,950
Every time he looks at this box, he always cries

134
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,330
Intouch

135
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,270
Your dad was really sad too

136
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,950
Your dad cried so much

137
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,730
He cried like his whole world was falling down

138
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,150
Dad

139
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,150
I’m sorry

140
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,350
It's my fault

141
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,770
I hurt everyone around me

142
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,490
I’m sorry

143
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,590
Dad

144
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,170
Korn

145
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,850
After the funeral

146
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,670
We've been keeping in touch with Intouch’s family

147
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,670
Until the day that Intouch's dad got sick

148
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,670
We knew that he was leaving us soon

149
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,350
Our dad promised him that

150
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,050
He will do his best to take care of everything

151
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,870
He's taking care of our family

152
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,790
Your condo too

153
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,350
Please, don’t be angry at our dad

154
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,190
In, don’t be angry at them

155
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,310
They’re in pain for so long already

156
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,990
Kard was so angry at Dad. He wouldn’t forgive him

157
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,590
Even when he was sick and almost died

158
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,830
He still wouldn’t see dad

159
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,990
I’m sorry

160
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,430
It’s because of me

161
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,550
I hurt everyone around me

162
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,910
I was stupid

163
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,010
I was selfish

164
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,030
But now

165
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,350
I love everyone

166
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,350
I love you, dad

167
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,350
Mom

168
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,530
I love all of my brothers

169
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,110
And I love you so much, In

170
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,850
I’m sorry, In

171
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,930
I’m so sorry

172
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,950
I’m sorry

173
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,850
Intouch...

174
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,490
He thought that he was strong

175
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,330
Your umbrella

176
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,950
It's too big and heavy

177
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,690
Mine is the better choice

178
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,110
Let me take care of you

179
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,450
I’m sorry

180
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,490
I’m sorry that I blame you for everything

181
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,410
I love you

182
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,750
I forgive you

183
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,760
You can stop blaming yourself

184
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,700
I love you too, In

185
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,700
I love you so much

186
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,760
I don't think he will get any better

187
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,800
Please excuse me

188
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,480
Dad, is there anything you want?

189
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,200
Please take care of him

190
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,180
I will

191
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,360
I promise

192
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,480
Where are you going?

193
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,900
We are free from each other now

194
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,460
We don’t have to love each other anymore

195
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,760
But

196
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,860
We truly love each other, don’t we?

197
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,860
It’s not because of the red thread

198
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,920
No

199
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,400
We love each other because of the red thread

200
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,699
I should have gone to the States and stay with mom for a week

201
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,320
I shouldn’t pretend to be strong

202
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,900
Our love

203
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,900
Is it real?

204
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,940
Do you understand this question yet?

205
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,240
How should I do it?

206
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
It’s the same as this question

207
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,100
But you just have to change this

208
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,400
That’s right

209
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,400
Read the question carefully

210
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Look-Choup

211
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,400
So cute

212
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
There’s Thai Shrimp Paste Chili Sauce too

213
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
I will eat…

214
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,580
This one

215
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,900
Eat this with Mackerel

216
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
With chili paste too

217
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
By the way

218
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,820
When did you find time to make all of this?

219
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,400
We have so much homework to do

220
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,740
Did you even sleep?

221
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,900
Oh my god

222
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,900
Look at your eyes

223
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
What happened?

224
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,560
Is there something wrong?

225
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,700
Did you have a fight with Dean?

226
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,220
No

227
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,680
I couldn’t sleep

228
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,260
I think it’s because of the exam. It makes me stressed

229
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,080
Keep fighting

230
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,620
Is Dean picking you up today?

231
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,160
Yes, he’s coming

232
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,620
We have a date today

233
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,320
Make sure you get enough sleep tonight

234
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,560
Or you won’t be able to come to class tomorrow

235
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,160
You crazy! Of course, we won’t do such thing

236
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Team!

237
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,400
I like that

238
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,700
Don’t do anything that will make you're too tired. You have class tomorrow

239
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,400
What are we going to do?

240
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
Don’t do that. Dean might see you guys

241
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,820
But Dean is not here. It’s okay. Do whatever you want

242
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,400
We’re best friends

243
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,400
Can I join you guys?

244
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,900
Hug me too

245
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
I already ate it

246
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,640
Hug me too

247
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,400
Manaow!

248
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,360
Your head is too big

249
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,480
Your hair makes my Look-Choup dirty

250
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,400
Let me eat it too

251
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
This one is cute

252
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,820
I’m so happy now

253
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
Oh no, my bag

254
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,140
Do this question first before worrying about other people

255
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,520
Dean

256
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,380
Do you want to eat anything?

257
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,300
I want to eat ice-cream

258
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,160
You should eat food first

259
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,520
Before you eat ice-cream

260
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,160
Okay?

261
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,320
Let’s go

262
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,220
Don’t finish the whole thing at once

263
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Pharm

264
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,900
What are you thinking?

265
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,400
Dean

266
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,840
I think

267
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,220
We should stay apart for a while

268
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,480
Why do we have to do that?

269
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,600
To think over

270
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,400
That our love is real

271
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,450
Three months later

272
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,450
You guys are hungry now, right?

273
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,450
Yes!

274
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,450
What else did we order?

275
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:28,950
BBQ pork set

276
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,450
BBQ pork set!

277
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,450
Should we start?

278
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,450
Let’s start

279
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:37,950
Pharm

280
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,450
Can you grill it for me?

281
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,450
I need more makeup

282
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,450
I won't have energy to eat if I don’t apply makeup

283
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,710
We’re here to eat and you still care about your beauty

284
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,450
Because I’m a pretty girl. I have to keep up my standard

285
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,450
Okay. I will grill this for you

286
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,160
What’s wrong with her?

287
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:09,580
What?

288
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,080
Nothing

289
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,450
Do you want it too?

290
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
No, thanks

291
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Here for you

292
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:20,600
I’m done

293
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
How do I look?

294
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,000
Stunning?

295
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,600
Stunning...

296
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
You look so-so

297
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,500
No matter how many times I look at you, you still look the same

298
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,300
So-so?

299
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,600
I’ve got something for you to see

300
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,100
What’s that?

301
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,600
I’ll show you

302
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Let me get it out

303
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,100
What’s that?

304
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,600
Look

305
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Manaow

306
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,100
What did you do?

307
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Nothing

308
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,600
Look over there

309
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,100
What did you do to my forehead?

310
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
You'll see it later

311
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Look over there first

312
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,060
Nants ingonyamaaaaaa

313
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,180
Manaow

314
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,880
What is she doing?

315
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,100
Manaow

316
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,600
What?

317
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,100
It’s cute

318
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
What did you do?

319
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,600
What?

320
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Don’t eat yet

321
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,320
Don’t touch your phone

322
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,380
Let me see my face

323
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,100
Let’s eat

324
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,600
What?

325
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,100
Just eat

326
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,600
It’s cooked already

327
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
It's cooked for a while already

328
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
Can I eat this now?

329
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
I want to eat this one

330
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
I think

331
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,700
We should take a photo

332
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Whose camera?

333
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
Let’s use Team’s

334
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
Team you should take it

335
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,100
I don’t want to stay at the front

336
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,600
I’m just a little girl

337
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,100
Why are you guys still playing? Go to practice

338
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Let’s practice now

339
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,280
Let's go

340
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,560
How’s your swimming club?

341
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,300
We just have to practice these days

342
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,100
Manaow!

343
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,600
Pharm

344
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,100
Team

345
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:06,600
Are you okay?

346
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
I’m fine

347
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,600
I have something to tell you guys. I won the film competition

348
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,600
Huh?

349
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,100
Really?

350
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:14,600
Yes

351
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Congratulations

352
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,220
You’re the best

353
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,100
Congratulations

354
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,300
I'm so happy

355
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,300
Did it hurt when you fell?

356
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,600
Not really

357
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,600
But let’s go to the hospital

358
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,060
Congratulations

359
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,600
Today I will show you how to make Thai dessert

360
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,600
Today we’re going to make Inthanin

361
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,220
It’s a traditional dessert and it’s quite hard to find

362
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,100
There’re not much ingredients needed

363
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,100
But it takes a lot of time for the rice balls to cook

364
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,600
I already prepared the ingredients and the recipe for all of you

365
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,600
If you guys have any questions, feel free to ask

366
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,100
We can start now

367
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Pharm

368
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,100
You and Dean

369
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,600
Are you guys still together?

370
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,100
(Thank you. Dean)

371
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,980
We never break up

372
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,620
Dean: What time is your class tomorrow?

373
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,560
Pharm: Early in the morning. I’m not sure if the class will be cancelled or not

374
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,940
Dean: Did you take your medicine?

375
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,100
What do you think we should make next week?

376
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,640
Someone who loves your dessert told me to give this to you

377
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,100
(Never forget)

378
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
He just dropped by

379
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,100
I already gave him the dessert

380
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,600
I think I know now

381
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,100
What I’m going to make

382
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,000
What is it?

383
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
I will make Leum Kleun

384
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,540
Iced Caramel Macchiato

385
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,400
Half pump of syrup

386
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,240
Whip cream too

387
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,840
For Team

388
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,040
Iced…

389
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,120
Cara…

390
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,180
What is it again?

391
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,240
Will I get to drink it today?

392
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,060
I’m trying

393
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,080
If you’re going to order a coffee for me

394
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,680
You can do this

395
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,840
Show them the photo

396
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,440
Tell them you want a medium size

397
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,880
Half pump of syrup

398
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,880
And tell them your name

399
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,880
Medium size coffee

400
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Half sweet

401
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,840
My name, Team

402
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,020
Yes

403
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,720
Go

404
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,660
One more time

405
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,220
Excuse me

406
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,380
I want

407
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,100
This one

408
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,320
Medium size

409
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,660
Half pump of syrup

410
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,920
Add whip cream

411
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,360
My name is Team

412
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,360
Thank you

413
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,560
I got it

414
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,520
Here

415
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,220
What else do you like to eat?

416
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,120
If it’s coffee, I can drink anything

417
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,780
As long as it’s half sweet

418
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,780
Half sweet…

419
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,220
We can slowly learn about each other

420
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,380
What did you just say?

421
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,500
Nothing

422
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,040
What about you? What do you like to eat apart from Lays?

423
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,800
Many things

424
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
Bingsu

425
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,100
BBQ

426
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,020
Cake

427
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,500
I like everything

428
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,240
Steak

429
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,160
I like it all

430
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,360
All the fatty stuff

431
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,160
Why? I like it

432
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,080
Let’s go

433
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,260
Come on

434
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,240
I’ll take you around

435
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,820
Are you coming or not?

436
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,820
Do you want to eat or not? I'll pay

437
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,520
Fine

438
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,500

439

Team

440
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,260
Del

441
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,720
What’s wrong with Del?

442
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,260
Del and Alex are in a relationship

443
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,740
What?

444
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,100
Since when?

445
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,980
I don’t know too

446
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,740
I cannot wait any longer

447
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,000
Today my club is going to celebrate

448
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,800
I will go clear things up with Del

449
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,860
I will go now

450
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,280
How can she not tell me about this?

451
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,880
She’s with Alex?

452

453
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,020
Your Leum Kleun

454
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,020
Seniors from my club said thank you

455
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,940
Dean: I ate it already. Thank you

456
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,940
What?

457
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,920
You're so irritating

458
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,860
What?

459
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,920
A few days ago, I saw you went to watch a movie with Win

460
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,400
Tell me about it

461
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,280
I’m going home now

462
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,940
Why are you leaving me now?

463
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,420
Tell me about it first

464
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,280
There’s nothing to say

465
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,000
I won’t believe it

466
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,520
I forgot my bag

467
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,420
What are you guys doing?

468
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,920
It’s because of Team

469
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,740
I’m going home now

470
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,340
Just let me go

471
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,380
I have to go and ask Del first

472
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,620
I will update you guys later

473
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,360
I’m going too

474
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,860
You guys should go home

475
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,580
You should go back too. It's getting late

476
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,920
Tell me the truth first

477
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,280
It’s nothing

478
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,300
How can you say there’s nothing?

479
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,220
Let’s just go back home

480
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,640
Team

481
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,640
Tell me about it first

482
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,240
It’s nothing!

483
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,540
I don't believe it

484
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,900
I’m so jealous of everyone who’s in a relationship

485
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,440
Pruek

486
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,540
I’m sorry

487
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,480
You’re not going home yet?

488
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,200
I’m going back soon

489
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,640
I was so surprised

490
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,280
Is this for Del?

491
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,380
Who says it’s for Del?

492
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,020
It’s for you

493
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,840
For me?

494
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,280
Just take it

495
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,520
Congratulations on your success

496
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,780
I only won a second place

497
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,360
Someone told me

498
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,560
It doesn’t matter what place you got

499
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,560
You still got the prize

500
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,280
You're crazy

501
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,720
I watched your movie already

502
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,180
I think you're really good at acting

503
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,220
Thank you

504
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,620
You're amazing

505
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,840
You're making me shy

506
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,820
Let go of my hand

507
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,280
Let me go

508
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,540
It's late already

509
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,560
Don't go back home by yourself

510
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,580
You should go back with your friends

511
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,520
But

512
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,020
All of my friends already went back home

513
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,460
Would you...

514
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,460
Would you like to accompany me?

515
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,280
What are we waiting for? Let's go

516
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,320
Let's go

517
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,680
I'm so happy!

518
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,520
Thank god. You have mercy

519
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,680
Korn

520
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,280
I want to eat ice-cream

521
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,300
Why do you like to eat weird stuff?

522
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,740
Ice-cream is weird?

523
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,740
I haven’t told you what flavor I will eat

524
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,960
This time I'll eat...

525
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,960
Should I eat corn soup flavor?

526
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,140
Let’s go on a trip

527
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,900
Let’s go to Kanchanaburi

528
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,980
I watched a soap opera

529
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,620
And the couple was having a romantic moment there

530
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,580
It was so cute

531
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,140
You’re talking nonsense again

532
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,020
You watch too much drama

533
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,140
Thank you

534
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,580
Korn, let's go

535
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,280
Dean

536
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,700
Where can I go?

537
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
I belong to you

538
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,940
I miss you

539
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,360
I miss you, Dean

540
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,740
I miss you too

541
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,080
I miss you so much

542
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,100
I’m so sorry

543
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,540
I'm sorry

544
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,580
I'm sorry for making you wait

545
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,280
It's okay, my good boy

546
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,220
It's okay

547
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,340
I'm here

548
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,280
I'm right here

549
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,080
I had a dream

550
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,580
I saw Korn and Intouch

551
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,420
They are happy now

552
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,860
They are really happy

553
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,920
They are really happy

554
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,340
Don't ever do that again

555
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:40,920
Let's go

556
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,180
Dean

557
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,000
What are you doing?

558
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,080
I will do everything to make up for lost time

559
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,520
Let me go now

560
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,520
Stop moving

561
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,160
If you keep moving, I will throw you now

562
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,920
Very good

563
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,300
Let's go

564
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,480
Dean!

565
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,980
Let me go

566
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,960
Dean

567
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,900
What are you going to do?

568
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,800
Your punishment for keeping me waiting

569
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,460
Dean

570
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,540
Dean

571
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,060
Dean

572
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,900
Stop

573
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,840
Stop it now

574
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,860
Dean

575
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,640
I'm sorry for making you wait

576
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,100
But right now

577
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,260
I am sure that

578
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,280
Our love

579
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,220
Is...

580
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,560
Real

581
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,240
Are you sleepy?

582
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,440
I miss you

583
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,260
You were the one who wanted to be apart

584
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,040
I was confused at that time

585
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,520
What about now?

586
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,920
I love you

587
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,300
Do you mean that?

588
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,640
How much do you love me?

589
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,640
I love you so much

590
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,700
I love you too

591
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,020
For the past three months

592
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,980
I’ve been thinking about a lot of things

593
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,200
I already changed my surname

594
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:50,600
Huh?

595
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,000
You changed your surname?

596
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,600
Why did you change it? What’s your new surname?

597
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:08,640
I’m not Rattanon Wongnate anymore

598
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,700
But now

599
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,660
I’m Rattanon Chatphokin

600
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,840
That surname…

601
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,840
That is Intouch’s surname

602
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,520
Yes

603
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:33,460
I want to apologize to his dad

604
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,380
And also, I want to apologize to Intouch

605
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,500
Don’t cry

606
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,760
It’s okay

607
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,260
Thank you

608
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,900
Do me a favor

609
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,260
Can you get my wallet for me?

610
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,560
Open it

611
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,780
You know it was me

612
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,480
Of course

613
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,300
Take out the photo

614
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,760
A ring?

615
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,580
Intouch’s ring

616
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,040
It’s his family ring

617
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,560
It will be passed on to the son

618
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,479
And

619
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,500
Right now

620
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,500
I am the son of that family

621
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,220
It might seem like I didn’t put effort into this

622
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,220
But this is the most important

623
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:59,260
The most precious thing that I have right now

624
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:39,000
After we graduate

625
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,580
Let’s live together

626
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,080
Okay

627
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,420
Always together

628
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,859
Okay

629
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,260
We will never be apart again

630
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,820
Never
