You fool!

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,900
How many times did I tell you?

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,990
You're not allowed to meet that guy.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,490
Why not?

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,990
Do you know

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,490
what other people are saying about you?

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,990
Who cares about what they say?

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,490
You care about them?

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,990
People are saying 
that you're a sissy gay boy.

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,990
They are making fun of you.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,400
Are you okay with that?

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,990
I am your son.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,490
You care about them more than me?

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,810
Because you are my son,

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,920
I cannot accept it.

17
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,400
Remember this. 
You will not meet him ever again.

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,990
If you do, don't call me your father.

19
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,990
If we died and we were born again,

20
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,490
do you think we would find each other?

21
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,300
Yes.

22
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,990
Really?

23
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,990
Yes.

24
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,110
I would keep searching until I find you.

25
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,990
Promise me that 
we will always find each other.

26
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,990
Promise.

27
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,900
You two.

28
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,490
Promise what?

29
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,990
I...

30
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,990
I...

31
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,490
I promise him that I will drive him home.

32
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,990
So... I don't have 
to drop him off anymore?

33
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,399
You don't have to worry about me.

34
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,410
I will sleep over at Manaow's place.

35
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,490
Yes, please.

36
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,899
Okay. Deal.

37
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,990
Let's eat.

38
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,990
Yay!

39
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:25,990
Eat!

40
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,490
Oh, right. Dean,

41
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,490
I was daydreaming today.

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,490
Daydreaming?

43
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,490
When did you have time to do that?

44
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,990
When I was making desserts,

45
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,540
there were flashes of images in my head 
that I had a niece.

46
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,300
Do you actually have a niece?

47
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,909
From my mum's side,

48
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,410
there's my aunt who lives in the US.

49
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,910
She's not married yet.

50
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,400
From my dad's side,

51
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,490
I don't know any of them.

52
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,410
My brother is just 15-16 years old.

53
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,490
So it's definitely not him.

54
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,990
Are you saying
that you want to have a kid?

55
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,690
I didn't mean it that way.

56
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,910
I...

57
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,990
I just feel weird

58
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,990
that I suddenly have a niece.

59
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,490
I have a sister too.

60
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,300
You're not getting enough sleep.

61
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,230
Go.

62
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,060
You'd better go to sleep early.

63
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,990
Okay...

64
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,490
Thank you for dropping me off.

65
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,990
Can I have something more 
than 'thank you'?

66
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,990
Dean.

67
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,490
Good night.

68
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,990
Dean.

69
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,990
Good night.

How's the food?

72
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,040
Delicious?

73
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,100
It's delicious.

I'm really full.

Delicious?

Why did you come here so early?

80
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,940
My father went out to do his business.

81
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,700
My dad is also not home.

82
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,940
That's good. 
We can spend more time together.

83

Looks like it's going to rain.

I think so too.

But that's good.

We can use it to hang the key.

Do you know what his family does?

Dad,

146

it doesn't matter what his family does.
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,510
I can smell Tom Yum.

178
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,300
I'm sure it's Tom Yum Soup.

179
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
He looks familiar.

180
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,920
That's Pharm,

181
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the fresher from the Faculty of Economics.

182
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,500
Right.

183
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,210
You're way cuter in person.

184
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
Hello, Pharm.

185
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Hello.

186
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,490
You guys know him?

187
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,220
Silp, he is so famous.

188
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,220
He's good looking.

189
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,720
He can cook too.

190
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,220
His smile is so sweet.

191
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,900
His photos 
are all over our university's WebBoard.

192
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,710
What else?

193
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,720
The Cute Boy page.

194
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,210
There're many photos of him.

195
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,800
Also...

196
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,800
The imaginary couple.

197
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,090
Huh?

198
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,790
What's that?

199
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,300
Let me tell him to come out first.

200
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,880
You've been in there 
for too long. Come out!

201
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,840
I'm almost done. Just a sec.

202
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,720
Damn you! You're interrupting 
my peaceful moment.

203
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,300
So, who wants to meet me?

204
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,330
This is Pharm. The one that people 
ship with your brother.

205
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,220
Why are you staring at him like that?

206
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
He lost his appetite now. Can't you see?

207
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,270
Pharm.

208
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,210
But I really want to know.

209
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,210
Those photos of you and Don's brother.

210
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,270
Are you guys 
just an imaginary couple or a real one?

211
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,720
Your reaction.

212
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Can I take that as an answer?

213
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,220
But they look 
like a real couple in the photos.

214
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Is it real, Don?

215
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,460
You guys want to know, right?

216
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,210
Don.

217
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,800
Wait.

218
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,300
Don!

219
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Don...

220
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,220
What's up little sis?

221
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,710
[Don!]

222
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,260
[How come you are with Pharm?]

223
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,450
[Why are you not taking me?]

224
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,840
[You are the worst!]

225
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,210
You envy me?

226
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Pharm is sitting right next to me.

227
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Hello Del.

228
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,260
[Pharm...]

229
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,250
[Don sent me a lot of food photos.]

230
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,330
[He is so mean.]

231
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,340
Del, is Dean at home?

232
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,970
[He's not. 
He left home early in the morning.]

233
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,040
[Everyone left me home alone.]

234
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,740
[Pharm, don't you feel bad for me?]

235
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,780
[I really want to eat your desserts.]

236
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,010
I will make it for you later.

237
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,840
[Yay! I won't share it with you, Don!]

238
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,260
Whatever. I will steal it later.

239
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,950
[Don!]

240
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,340
Oh no! My signal is so bad.

241
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,260
You sister is whining too much.

242
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,020
We didn't get any clue about your brother.

243
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
But two people already read the chat.

244
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,050
Your food is so good,
just like what people say.

245
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,800
It's time for you guys to clean up.

246
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Let's go.

247
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,300
Pharm, let me do it.

248
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,800
Wow.

249
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,900
Is that the smell of Tom Yum?

250
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,300
I guess I'm too late.

251
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Sorn?

252
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,470
Hi Pharm.

253
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,300
You made Tom Yum Soup?

254
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm sad I didn't get to eat it.

255
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,850
Someone keeps boasting 
that everything you make is delicious.

256
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,050
You're talking too much.

257
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Dean.

258
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,710
Dean?

259
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,790
How come you're here?

260
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,300
He came to meet me this morning.

261
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,410
I told him I will meet Silp later.

262
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,760
He didn't say anything.

263
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,710
Then, he saw something on his phone.

264
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
He suddenly decided to come too.

265
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,220
I confirm.

266
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
They're a real couple for sure.

267
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,220
Obviously.

268
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,410
Since he entered the room,

269
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,760
he has only looked at Pharm.

270
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,520
He isn't paying attention to you at all.

271
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,510
Brother vs Boyfriend.

272
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,570
He definitely chooses boyfriend.

273
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,220
I think I saw your car parked
at the front sometimes.

274
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
I didn't remember the wrong car then.

275
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
I just knew that you live here too.

276
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,300
You used to live somewhere else, right?

277
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,760
I've lived here for a while already,
since I graduated,

278
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,880
These juniors know
that I live near the university.

279
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,060
That's why they always come over.

280
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Right.

281
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Sorry, Pharm.

282
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
You probably know all of them already.

283
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,740
But let me introduce them to you again.

284
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,940
Over there.

285
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,430
That is Don.

286
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,300
He's my brother.

287
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
This is Silp.

288
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,300
He is Sorn's boyfriend.

289
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,300
Huh?

290
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,720
Let me tell you.

291
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,210
Sorn is Dean's childhood friend.

292
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Who became Silp's boyfriend.

293
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,590
Silp is my mentor at the university.

294
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,800
And these two are my friends
from the faculty.

295
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,750
How about our names?

296
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,300
Tell him my name too.

297
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,220
Right.

298
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,210
Let me introduce myself.

299
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,220
My name is Day and this is...

300
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
I'm Dew.

301
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,340
Enough.

302
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,590
You guys get back to work now
or you won't finish.

303
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,050
Feel free to do whatever you want.
I will turn on the music.

304
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,130
I'll make sure it's loud enough.

305
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,350
Whatever you're going to do, 
think about his parents. Take it slow.

306
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Don.

307
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
See you later, Pharm.

308
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,340
I'm surprised.

309
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,740
I didn't know that you like to listen 
to loud music.

310
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,980
I don't like the sound of rain.

311
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,980
So, I turn the music up loud to cover it.

312
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,840
Do you want some water?

313
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,540
Come here.

314
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,460
Korn.

315
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,540
It's raining.

316
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:43,950
Let's go.

317
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,540
I will drive you home.

318
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,460
I have...

319
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,540
Let's go.

320
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,460
Your umbrella is so small.

321
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,040
You will get wet.

322
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,450
You know nothing.

323
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,540
A small umbrella is good.

324
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,540
No one will care about us
if we're too close.

325
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
You will get sick.

326
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
It's no big deal.

327
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Just get wet and then get sick.

328
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Your umbrella

329
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,030
is too big and too heavy.

330
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,540
My umbrella is the best option.

331
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
Let me take care of you.

332
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,440
It would be cool if you had
an engineering workshop shirt.

333
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
Why?

334
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,050
That would be a romantic moment for us.

335
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,440
You could use your shirt to cover us
and we could run through the rain together.

336
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,540
You're talking too much. Let's go.

337
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,540
You're not romantic at all.

338
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,540
Come on.

339
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,460
In!

340
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
I'm sorry.

341
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,190
This morning,

342
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,330
I had a nightmare.

343
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,920
I can't remember the details.

344
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,330
But I was really sad.

345
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,540
When I woke up,

346
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,240
tears were all over my face.

347
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,540
It was not my first time.

348
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,610
It's Korn.

349
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,890
Do you know this name?

350
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
And...

351
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,330
Pharm.

352
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,220
Do you know the name...

353
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,740
Intouch?

354
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
You promised...

355
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,640
That we will always find each other.

356
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,730
I did.

357
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,330
I've found you,

358
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,830
as promised.

359
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,940
I want to take a walk outside.

360
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,840
It's wet outside.

361
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Let's stay inside.

362
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:44,960
Dean.

363
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,950
Don't mess around.

364
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Stop teasing me.

365
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,450
Dean.

366
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,040
Stay still.

367
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,540
Okay.

368
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,950
I will stop goofing around now.

369
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,040
Okay.

370
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
I'll stop.

371
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,540
Dean.

372
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
Stay still.

373
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,460
Stop it.

374
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,540
Dean.

375
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,540
Dean!

376
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,450
Stop it.

377
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
I surrender.

378
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,960
Surrender?

379
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,540
Why do you surrender so easily?

380
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,960
Why do you like to tease me?

381
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Okay.

382
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,540
I will not tease you anymore.

383
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,040
My dog tag.

384
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,840
It's very important to me.

385
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
I've been using it for ten years now.

386
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
I want you to take care of it.

387
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,820
Can you do that?

388
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,720
I'll put it with my necklace.

389
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,640
So, I will never lose it.

390
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Let me put it on for you.

391
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,980
Also...

392
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,460
This...

393
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
I'm giving it to you.

394
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,540
This is...

395
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,450
It's the spare key to my room.

396
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
Please keep it safe.

397
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
I promise

398
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,140
that I will keep it safe.

399
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,900
If P is the point on curve C.

400
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,900
And S is the length 
of the curve to point P.

401
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,990
So, the length is...

402
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,990
I don't understand anything.

403
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,490
I'm confused.

404
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,990
I'm so lucky.
My faculty doesn't have maths exam.

405
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,990
Fine. Let's take a break then.

406
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,990
I will rest for a while.

407
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,540
I'm lucky that Team
doesn't have a lot of brain cells.

408
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:44,900
Take it easy.

409
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,990
I can't hear what you said at all.

410
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,900
He keeps whining.

411
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,990
"I can't do this anymore"

412
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,990
[Pharm: Dean, where are you?]

413
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,990
I don't want to do maths either.

414
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,780
[Dean: I'm almost there.]

415
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,990
It's makeup time!

416
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,990
Are you in?

417
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,990
Your brain will function better 
after you put on makeup.

418
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Don't just look at me, Del.

419
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:24,990
Do you want?

420
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,490
Come on. Let's continue.

421
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,300
What page?

422
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,130
Are you okay, Manaow?

423
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,990
Page 148.

424
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:39,900
Page 148.

425
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,410
Yes.

426
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,490
Just after that question.

427
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,280
Are you guys studying?

428
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Alex...

429
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,490
Hi.

430
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,990
Hello.

431
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,990
What are you studying?

432
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,490
When will you stop bothering my friend?

433
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,990
Sorry.

434
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,620
Let me help you.

435
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,880
I can do it myself.

436
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,170
I'm sorry.

437
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Pharm.

438
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,630
Are you in a relationship 
with Dean already?

439
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,490
I told you before.

440
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,490
I want it to be clear.

441
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,490
You are his boyfriend, right?

442
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,200
Alex!

443
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,910
Calm down.

444
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,990
Sit.

445
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,280
If I'm his boyfriend,

446
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,490
what are you going to do about it?

447
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,330
I don't like to steal from other people.

448
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,490
I just want a clear answer.

449
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,490
You tell me.

450
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,490
Are you his boyfriend?

451
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,990
If yes,

452
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,490
I will stop approaching him.

453
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,490
You must stop then.

454
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,690
Because I don't like anyone
to flirt with my boyfriend.

455
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,990
Since when?

456
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
Just recently.

457
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,990
If it's not you, I won't believe it.

458
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,490
If you disappoint Pharm,

459
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:57,790
I will take him away from you.

460
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,490
He will never disappoint Pharm.

461
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,490
Really?

462
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:07,490
You crybaby.

463
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,990
Don't mess with my sister.

464
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,990
You are such an overprotective
boyfriend and brother.

465
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,990
I will leave now.

466
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,990
See you guys later.

467
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,790
I will see you around.

468
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,990
Bye.

469
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:47,910
You're okay, right?

470
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,910
I'm okay.

471
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,300
Are you guys together now?

472
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,580
That dude 
will stop bothering Pharm, right?

473
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,410
Alex understands the situation.

474
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,990
If he says no, it means no.

475
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,700
Will he believe that Dean and Pharm
are actually together?

476
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,240
Pharm has rejected him many times already.

477
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,490
But he still flirts with Pharm.

478
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,600
Of course, he will.

479
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:47,910
In our faculty,

480
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,530
Dean is well-known 
for being a man of his word.

481
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Dean

482
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,990
is always serious.

483
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,900
He doesn't joke around.

484
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,030
I don't understand why girls like him.

485
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,700
He's so boring.

486
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
You're teasing me?

487
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,170
[Guys, I got some good stuff.]

488
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:50,930
[What? Send it.]

489
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,900
[My friend was at the cafÃ©.
She recorded this.]

490
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,290
[What clip? Were they on a date?]

491
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,840
[Something more than that. Look!]

492
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:56,320
[Argh!]

493
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,880
[Guys, they are a real couple]

494
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,010
[I can rest in peace now.]

495
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,200
[Look at Pharm. 
He's so cute when he's shy.]

496
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,680
Hello Del.

497
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,550
[Have you seen the photos
in the group chat?]

498
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,300
I'm too scared to look.

499
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,990
[Manaow let me be one of the admins too.]

500
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,990
Manaow!

501
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:44,910
Don't tell me that you've called me
because you want me to be the admin too.

502
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:50,480
[How do you know? I'm joking! 
I'm calling you because I need your help.]

503
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,310
What's the matter?

504
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:58,790
[My parents are coming back soon.
I want to make something for them.]

505
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,310
Your parents?

506
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,190
[Yes. I want to make
Thai desserts for them.]

507
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,580
[Something that's easy and delicious. 
Do you have any idea?]

508
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,990
I have some ideas.

509
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,350
[That's great! Are you free this Sunday? 
Can you come to my house and teach me?]

510
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,990
Your house?

511
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:19,990
[Yes!]

512
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,330
What about...

513
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,990
What about our study for the exam?

514
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:29,580
[No need to worry.
We have Dean and Don to tutor us.]

515
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:31,990
Okay.

516
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,990
I will teach you guys on Sunday then.

517
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,490
[Yay!]

518
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,310
Dean's house.

519
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,990
I can do it!

520
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,310
[Pharm: Don't forget about this Sunday.]

521
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,170
[Manaow: I won't.]

522
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,220
[But I don't know why Del is asking us to
join. We don't want to be a third wheel.]

523
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,600
[Team: Don't worry Manaow.]

524
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:17,920
[We just have to hide while the lovers
are having their sweet moments.]

525
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,890
[Pharm: What are you talking about?
You're crazy.]

526
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,300
[Manaow: I like this.]

527
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,120
[Manaow: Couldn't agree more, Team!]

528
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,340
[Team: Don't be shy.
There's nothing left to be shy.]

529
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,720
[Pharm: I will go study now.]

530
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,300
[Team: Me too. See you!]

531
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:36,870
[Manaow: Okay. Bye!]

532
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,990
Nothing left?

533
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,910
Calm down, my tummy.

534
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,490
I will feed you more Lays.

535
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,030
How many bags should I buy?

536
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,990
One.

537
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,490
Two.

538
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,990
Three.

539
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,650
Why are you still here at this time?

540
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,990
Enough.

541
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,910
How many bags do you have already?

542
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,900
Come on. The exam is coming.

543
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,910
My brain cannot function properly
if I don't eat them.

544
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:49,990
I'm stupid.

545
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,900
If you're too stupid. I can tutor you.

546
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,990
Someone like you will tutor me?

547
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,990
Just so you know, my note is expensive.

548
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,300
There are many people
hiring me to tutor them.

549
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,490
Seriously?

550
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:07,900
If you don't try,

551
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,990
how will you know?

552
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,900
How about we make a deal?

553
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,480
After you finish studying
and doing exercises,

554
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,980
I'll let you eat one bag.

555
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,910
What about...

556
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,990
Your tutoring fee. Is it expensive?

557
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,990
That's my charge for tutoring.

558
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,490
Let's go.

559
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:57,490
Damn it!

560
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,400
[Like I told you,]

561
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,990
[I will send you more information.]

562
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,550
[Please help me, Silp.]

563
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:13,900
[Silp.]

564
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,990
[Are you listening to me?]

565
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,590
I am.

566
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,680
You want me to find out about those two.

567
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,510
[Yes.]

568
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,910
[I really need your help.]

569
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:27,490
[I tried to do it myself 
but I couldn't find anything.]

570
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,990
Okay. I will help you search.

571
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,490
But I can't promise you anything.

572
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,890
Even though my dad is a policeman,
I cannot get that much information.

573
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,130
Anyway,

574
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,990
I will ask my dad's subordinates to help.

575
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:44,910
[It's okay.]

576
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,980
[At least, I can narrow down the search.]

577
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,990
I will call you back
once I get any information.

578
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,300
[Thank you so much.]

579
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,910
[Korn and Intouch. Male. 
19 years old. Suicide]

580
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,990
Korn and Intouch?

581
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:42,250
[Next Episode]

582
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:36,310
Dean is still sleeping.

583
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,670
Someone should go wake him up.

584
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,910
Alin.
