wait for me.

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,790
Can you come to have lunch with me?

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,990
Korn.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,380
I will wait for you at the canteen.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,460
I won’t go.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,070
You have a heart of stone.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,990
I’ve been following you
for almost a month already.

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,080
I’m not asking you to do it.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Anyway, I will get lunch for you.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Why are you so stubborn?

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,410
I will wait until you come.

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,290
Okay?

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,370
See you later. Bye bye.

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
In!

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
It’s late already.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Maybe he went home already.

19
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,570
In.

20
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,990
You finally came.

21
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,990

Dean!

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,890
What’s wrong with you?

26
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,079
You didn’t respond
when I called your name.

27
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,490
Nothing.

28
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,510
I…

29
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,600
I just feel like I’ve forgotten something.

30
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,990
But,

31
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
you just said “In”.

32
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,880
What was that about?

33
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,990
Whatever.

34
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,490
Let’s go.

35
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,990
We should go to class now.

[Until We Meet Again]

37
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,170
Team and Pharm,
what do you guys want for lunch?

38
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,330
No, thanks.

39
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,600
We'll go buy some food then.

40
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,590
Okay.

41
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,320
If you want anything, just catch up!

42
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,790
-Okay.
-Be right back.

43
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,650
I’ll be right back.

44
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,270
Manaow and Del seem so close.

45
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,600
Of course, they practice
the play together every day.

46
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,290
Right. That’s true.

47
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,290
What were you thinking?

48
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,010
Where is everyone?

49
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,320
Who invited you to join us?

50
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,490
I’m a grown-up.

51
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,570
I can invite myself.

52
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,840
Get up. Go sit over there.

53
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,870
The owner of this seat is here.

54
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,650
I will let you win this time.

55
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,820
You’re so nosy.

56
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,880
The breakfast this morning

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,100
was so good.

58
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,490
You know,

59
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,990
he’s so stingy.

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,570
He wouldn’t let me have a bite.

61
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,360
I feel so sorry for you.

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,090
Because you’re not Dean,

63
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,490
Pharm doesn’t care about you.

64
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,130
Pharm…

65
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,210
Team.

66
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,320
Don’t listen to Team.

67
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,290
He’s always talking nonsense.

68
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,390
Are you shy?

69
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,490
Don’t be shy.

70
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,870
You’re blushing now.

71
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,290
That's enough.

72
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,659
You’re being extra now.

73
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,990
Let’s go buy food.

74
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,810
I’m hungry.

75
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,490
No!

76
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,990
Let’s go buy food. I’m hungry!

77
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,490
I’m not going with you.

78
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,060
What are you eating?

79
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,409
Spicy chicken.

80
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,400
Is it delicious?

81
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,730
Delicious, just like how you made it.

82
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,810
I will make it for you next time.

83
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,890
Looking forward to it.

84
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,830
Okay.

85
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,430
Dude, what the hell!

86
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,950

87
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,300
Huh?

88
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,860
What's wrong?

89
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,240
Nothing.

90
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Are you sure?

91
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,000
Pharm.

92
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,790
Are you okay?

93
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,490
Are you sick?

94
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,490
Your face is so red.

95
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,620
I’m okay.

96
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,490
Try breathing out.

97
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,490
Like this.

98
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,990
That seems normal.

99
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,990
What are you trying to do?

100
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,490
His face is so red.

101
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,130
That’s true.

102
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,050
It really is.

103
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Let us know if you’re not okay.

104
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,990
Del,

105
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,200
have you seen this?

106
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,290
I noticed you like make-up.

107
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
I bought it the day it was released.

108
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,990
Really?

109
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,289
Oh, right.

110
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,580
What are you guys doing
for the Open House event?

111
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,429
There will be some stands at my faculty.

112
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,490
There’s a walking tour to look around.

113
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,289
For the swimming club, we're going to

114
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,380
introduce our activities and do
a dunk tank water game.

115
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,310
I have to help my faculty in the morning.

116
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,010
I will help you later in the afternoon.

117
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,450
Okay. I already told
the teacher about that.

118
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,040
Swimming club seniors are so mean.

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,130
They let all the freshers
become the dunk tank boy.

120
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,990
I will definitely find time
to play the game.

121
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,710
Manaow.

122
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,490
Calm down.

123
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,390
Faculty of Arts is going to organize
some activities and games.

124
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,490
Also, the drama club will perform
a short stage play.

125
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,260
Pharm, how about you?

126
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,900
My faculty will have
an educational guidance,

127
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,490
board decorations

128
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,190
and games with desserts as reward.

129
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,080
The person who will make desserts is…

130
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Pharm, of course.

131
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,490
It’s very obvious whose idea this is.

132
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,690
It’s Team’s idea.

133
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,070
He told our faculty members to hire
the cooking club to make desserts.

134
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,380
Actually, the cooking club
will not have any stands.

135
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,310
I just want to eat.

136
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,990
Pharm, do you know what desserts
you're going to make?

137
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,770
The club members are planning
to make Bulan Dan Mek.

138
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,860
Not much people know about this dessert.

139
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,990
We are planning to make
two types of dessert.

140
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,490
But we aren’t sure
what we are going to make yet.

141
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,530
How about Look Choup?

142
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,830
It has to be star-shaped too.

143
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,990
Dean,

144
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,590
what dessert should he make?

145
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,400
I think...

146
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,860
How about Luem Kleun?

147
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,990
Right.

148
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,490
Dean.

149
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,970
I’m suddenly full.

150
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,490
I want to eat Luem Kleun already.

151
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,980
Don’t forget to eat your lunch.

152
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,990
Don’t forget to swallow it too.

153
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,050
Be careful not to choke.

154
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,620
Tell that to yourself.

155
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,450
[Good night, Dean.]

156
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,020
I just want to make something nice
for you to eat.

157
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,850
Here it is.

158
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,830
The best instant noodle in the world!

159
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,190
You can’t even make proper instant noodle?

160
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,690
I’ll make it myself next time.

161
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,680
I just want to make something nice
for you to eat.

162
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,690
By the way,

163
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,690
are you starting to like me now?

164
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,720
How come you still don’t know.

165
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,810
I just want to hear you say it.

166
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,230
Just keep guessing then.

167
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,970
You’re so mean.

168
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,590
I do like you.

169
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,190
I'll go make a new one.

170
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,780
What did you just say?

171
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,860
What did you just say?

172
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,500
Dean.

173
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,540

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,470
Dean!

175
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,910
Dean!

176
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,500
Open the door.

177
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,600
Dean!

178
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,000
Open the door, please.

179
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,000
You scared me.

180
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you okay?

181
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,520
I'm fine.

182
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,890
I’m fine.

183
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,890
I’ve got a headache.

184
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,780
Should we go to the hospital?

185
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,690
No need.

186
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I’m okay.

187
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,290
Are you really okay?

188
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,690
I’m okay.

189
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Don’t tell our parents about this.

190
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,000
I just dozed off.

191
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,050
Dean,

192
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,040
are you really okay?

193
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,650
I’m just tired.

194
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Thank you.

[Courses, clubs and activities]

197
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,190
This way!
You won’t be disappointed.

198
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,270
Come to this faculty.

199
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,470
Is this Thai coconut milk custard?

200
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,410
But the colour is so different
from the ones I’ve seen before.

201
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,190
This is Bulan Dan Mek.

202
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,780
Do you know it?

203
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,590
It is a traditional Thai dessert.

204
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,690
The middle part is made from egg.

205
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,370
Bulan means moon.

206
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,880
Its meaning refers
to the moon in the night sky.

207
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,599
You can try it.

208
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,540
Thank you.

209
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,470
It’s so delicious. Where can I buy it?

210
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,190
It tastes like coconut milk custard.

211
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,240
It smells so nice.

212
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,690
The texture is similar
to Thai floral rice cakes.

213
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,770
It’s very yummy.

214

If you get it right, you will get
a coupon for the dessert.

218

We also have Kanom Pra Pai.

219
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,750
Thank you so much.

Pharm, do you want to take a break?

221
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,670
You worked until late last night.
I’ll ask someone else to help.

222
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,190
I will come back
in the late afternoon then.

223
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,870
Sure.

224
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,070
See you later.

225
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,600
I think

226
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,150
I need more make-up.

227
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,180
More?

228
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,680
I don’t want it to fade.

229
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,690
-Want some?
-No, thanks.

230
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,010
I’m good.

231
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,880
It's going to fade.

232
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,770
It’s okay.

233
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,820
I don't think your make up will ever fade.

234
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,900
You’re already beautiful.

235
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,990
What are you doing here?

236
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,690
What’s that in your hand?

237
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
Let’s have a look.

238
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,190
Is there anything for me to eat?

239
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,250
I’m so nervous.

240
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
Me too.

241
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,470
I need your desserts to cheer me up.

242
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,130
Here.

243
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,690
This is for you guys.

244
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
For you two to share.

245
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Okay.

246
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,690
Do you have one for Team?

247
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,190
Here.

248
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,830
He will be angry if
I don’t have something for him.

249
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,910
How about…

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Dean?

251
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,890
This one.

252
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,880
Del!

253
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
What are you doing?

254
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,690
No!

255
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,220
Delete it.

256
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,980
I won’t.

257
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,560
Del…

258
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,000
Dean replied already.

259
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,830
He said,

260
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,870
"Find me at the Faculty
of Business Administration."

261
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,930
"I’ll be here until noon."

262
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,010
"Please come."

263
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,630
Just go there now!

264
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,690
Yeah! Dean is waiting.

265
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,180
Quick!

266
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,690
Before the desserts are spoiled!

267
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,490
Right?

268
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,990
Why is there none for me?

269
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,530
Del.

270
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,370
There are many left at my faculty.

271
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,650
I don’t want to go there.

272
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,290
I won’t see you there if I go now.

273
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,590
By the way,

274
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,930
have you been thinking about what I asked?

275
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,840
I remember that I rejected you already.

276
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,970
I know.
That's why I want to ask you again.

277
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,710
Have you been thinking thoroughly?

278
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,770
Why would I waste my time thinking?

279
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,860
Because

280
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,710
I don’t have feelings for you in that way.

281
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,190
Ouch!

282
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,050
You have someone that you like already?

283
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes.

284
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,140
Is it Dean?

285
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,190
That's enough.

286
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,550
I’ve got something to do.

287
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
I’d better go.

288
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,440
Good luck, guys.

289
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,690
Thank you.

290
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,620
Bye bye.

291
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,800
But if you’re not together yet,

292
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,370
it means I still have a chance.

293
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,850
How do you know
that we’re not together yet?

294
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,580
What did I just say?

295
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,370
Are you interested
in Business Administration?

296
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,290
Are you interested?

297
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,160
Are you interested
in Business Administration?

298
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,590
Hey, Pharm!

299
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,000
Are you looking for him?

300
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,090
Yes.

301
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,590
Pharm is here.

302
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,250
What brings you here?

303
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,590
You brought something too?

304
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,170
What is it?

305
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,300
Desserts?

306
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,310
Yes.

307
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,890
It looks yummy.

308
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,540
Can I try?

309
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,070
Sure.

310
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,430
My hands are dirty.

311
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,630
Can you feed me?

312
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,940
Please?

313
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,590
Feed me.

314
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Okay.

315
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,480
It’s so delicious.

316
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,440
I don’t know if
it’s because of the dessert,

317
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,590
or because you fed me.

318
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,020
What is this dessert called?

319
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,990
It’s called Kanom Pra Pai.

320
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,090
And Bulan Dan Mek.

321
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,090
How did you know all this?

322
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,090
I won’t tell you.

323
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,090
My grandmother likes
to make Thai desserts.

324
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,590
Why are you telling me this?

325
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,580
I’m telling Pharm.

326
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,240
So, what are you guys doing?

327
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,210
This is a buddy game.

328
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,290
The chosen one will take you
on a tour around our faculty.

329
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,280
Come.

330
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,090
Since Pharm is here at our stand,

331
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,000
I think he should play some game.

332
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,190
Let’s see who will be chosen
to give you a tour.

333
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,990
Me?

334
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,590
But I’m a fresher already.

335
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,590
It’s okay.

336
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,790
Doesn't matter. I just want to give you
a tour of our faculty.

337
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,090
I also want to know
which handsome guy will be picked.

338
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,980
Pick one.

339
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,490
Are you sure?

340
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,580
This one, right?

341
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,200
Well, well.

342
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,590
This is not fun at all.

343
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,390
I think he planned this.

344
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,390
Maybe it’s fate.

345
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,170
Go away.

346
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,860
Just go back to your seat.

347
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,880
I am going.

348
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,470
I wish you a house full of children.

349
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,690
Shut up.

350
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,510
Let’s go.

351
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,790
I'll take you around.

352
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,790
Okay.

353
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,610
Come and feed me dessert again.

354
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,490
My faculty suddenly looks sad.

355
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,500
The building is small there.

356
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,090
We don’t even have our own library.

357
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,590
We have to use the central library.

358
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,590
It is very crowded.

359
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,500
All the successful alumni
are supporting us by building all these.

360
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,900
After this floor,

361
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,420
let’s go look at the boards.

362
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,930
And go get something to eat later.

363
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,590
Okay.

364
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,090
I will give the desserts to you
at the club later then.

365
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,590
I have to give them to Team too.

366
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,590
Your friends just ate everything
I brought.

367
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,090
I have some for Win too.

368
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,890
Who cares about Win.

369
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,920
So...

370
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,550
Why did you make Kanom Pra Pai?

371
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,190
It has a good meaning.

372
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,680
Also,

373
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,930
I want you to try it.

374
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,950
What’s the meaning?

375
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,120
Kanom Pra Pai is usually eaten
at wedding ceremonies.

376
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,590
It is made from glutinous rice flour.

377
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,580
It symbolizes strong love,

378
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
a stable relationship.

379
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,800
The sweet mung bean filling

380
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
means...

381
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,850
sweet love.

382
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,580
Who taught you to say something like this?

383
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,010
Dean.

[But if you’re not together yet,]

385

[it means I still have a chance.]

386
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
[How do you know that
we’re not together yet?]

387
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,350

388
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,930

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,090
Just come out.

393
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,710
Don’t look at me.

394
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,530
I’m glad that you told him that.

395
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,380
Next time,

396
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,930
if Alex is still messing with you,

397
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,660
I will deal with him by myself.

398
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,540
Okay?

399
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,090
Okay.

400
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,590
I won’t let you go.

401
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,740
I’ve been waiting for so long.

402
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,850
I will not wait any longer.

403
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,490
You understand me, right?

404
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,090
Your answer?

405
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,540
I understand.

406
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,670
Understand what?

407
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,770
I understand that…

408
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,320
we love each other.

409

You’re okay, right?

411
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,880
Really?

412
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,690
Let me see.

413
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,590
So...

414
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,510
You’re really okay, right?

415
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,250
I’m okay.

416
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,010
Come on.

417
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,010
Let’s go.

418
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,310
Wait for me here.

419
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,450
Okay.

420

[DeanPharm's Grand Opening

[Manaow: What’s this? Tell me! @Pharm]

422

00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
What’s wrong?

424
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,350
Dean.

425
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,500
It’s cute.

426
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,220
I like the way the red thread
wraps around your finger.

427
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,590
But…

428
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,500
If it doesn’t invade our privacy too much,

429
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,710
I think it’s okay.

430
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,540
Also,

431
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,590
I think it’s a good way
to let that person know.

432
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,800
That he shouldn’t mess
with someone who is not single.

433
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,090
Let’s eat.

434
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,590
Thank you.

435
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,550
I have to go back to my club first.

436
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Want me to drop you off?

437
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,640
It’s okay.

438
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,730
I don't want to be teased.

439
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,310
You should go back to your faculty too.

440
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Thank you.

441
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,590
See you later.

442
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
I told you to take a rest.

443

He went to refresh his heart, you know?

444
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,540
What are you talking about?

445
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,920
Stop acting like you don’t get it.

446
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,000
I saw two lovebirds holding hands.

447
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,090
How much should we charge him
for holding our member’s hands?

448
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,590
We should force him
to always order food from us.

449
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,680
Stop trying to pull a poker face.

450
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,080

Yes?

Can I make Bulan Dan Mek instead?

458
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,580
Yes, of course.

It won't be too long.

You must not sleep over.

to check on you.

How can Bulan Dan Mek
smell like sour curry?

499
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,810
It smells just like Bulan Dan Mek.

500
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,530
I think I’ve got a cold.

501
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,750
Stop.

502
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Take off your apron.

503
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,990
Just go back home and take a rest.

504

He went to get some documents.

I’m just here
to give desserts to you guys.

532

You don't have a special set for Dean?

533
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,490
Dean already ate it.

534
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,450
So...

535
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,840
I cannot eat it anymore?

536
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,340
I have some for you too.

537
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,830
Poor Pharm.

538
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,840
You secretly kept a special set for him.

539
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:27,640
Enough.

Just share these with other people.

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,140
You like to eat Kanom Pra Pai?

542
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,460
Yes.

543
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,840
I’m addicted to Kanom Pra Pai these days.

544
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,340
It’s sweet.

What do you think?

You're asking me?

549
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,840
I’m not.

550
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,420
I asked Dean.

551
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,510
But,

552
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
he'll probably let you decide.

553
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:15,840
Wow! You guys make decisions
for each other too?

554
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,200
What?

555
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,700

560
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,890
This colour is so pretty.

Is it nice?

562
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,670
How do you know if it suits you or not?

Let me show you how.

00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,340
Okay.

565

This is how you do it.

What did you do to yourself?

572
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,920
I tried on lipsticks.

573

I’ll clean it for her later.

Anything.

But...

577
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,550
not Western Cuisine.

578
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Why are you so picky?

579
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,740
How about Shabu-shabu?

580

That sounds good.

581

I’m in.

582
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
Anything is good for me.

583
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
Okay.

584
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,340
Let’s go.

585
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,410
What?

586
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,750
Don’t even think about it.

587
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,340
Go away. Start walking.

588
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,340
You know me too well.

589
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,390
We should interrogate them too.

590
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,840
I need an update.

591
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,340
Do you know that this restaurant
uses organic vegetables?

592
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,840
This is good for my diet.

593
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,930
You’re on diet?

594
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Here I come.

595
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,090
Got some veggies.

596
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,840
We won’t get fat eating this.

597
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,020
How was the stage play today?

598
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:42,250
Today, our play is about a love story.

599
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,340
The main character woke up and found
a red thread tied to his finger.

600
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,000
So, he went on a journey
to find the other end of the thread.

601
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,060
What’s the meaning of the red thread?

602
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,470
I will just cut it if I woke up
and had a red thread tied to my finger.

603
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,550
So annoying.

604
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,260
You’re not romantic at all.

605
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,740
Let me explain.

606
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,830
Japanese people believe that

607
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,800
soulmates will have the red thread
tied to their left pinky.

608
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,690
It symbolizes the blood vessel
from the heart,

609
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,560
tying to the person that
you are destined to be with.

610
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,840
Do you understand?

611
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,930
So what?

612
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,950
It’s a belief, you know?

613
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Like this.

614
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,340
Team!

615
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,910
I understand that now.

616
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,340
You guys are soulmates.

617
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,720
Just wait until it’s my turn.

618
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,840
Delete it now.

619
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,840
No.

620
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,340
Don’t delete it.

621
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,340
When I was practising the stage play,

622
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,840
I also heard the Chinese legend
about the red thread.

623
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,840
What’s the difference?

624
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,340
It’s different.

625
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,340
Japanese people believe that the
red thread is tied to the left pinky.

626
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,640
But, the Chinese legend says that
two people destined to be together,

627
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,830
will have the red thread
tied to their ankles.

628
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,780
Have you heard about this tale?

629
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,450
Lovers who cannot be together,

630
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,840
will tie the red thread
around their wrists.

631
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,840
And commit double suicide.

632
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:30,840
They believe that the red thread
will bring them back together.

633
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,830
Korn!

634
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,390
That’s deep.

635
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,530
When they are reborn again,

636
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,520
both of them

637
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,560
will feel like they have known
each other for so long.

638
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,030
Like they've waited for their whole lives.

639
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,040
I got goosebumps already.

640
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:01,580
I want to know how they feel
when they first meet each other.

641
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,790
They feel…

642
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
warm.

do you think we will
find each other again?

We will.

Yes.

I will keep searching until I find you.

651
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,640

always find each other.
