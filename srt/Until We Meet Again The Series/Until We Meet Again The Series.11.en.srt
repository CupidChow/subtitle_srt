2
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,010
In,

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,910
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,580
All the shops are closed already.

5
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,430
It's okay.

6
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,590
I said it's okay.

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,090
Don't worry.

8
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,170
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,050
I ruined your Christmas.

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,730
It's okay.

11
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,040
I think

12
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,770
it doesn't matter where we're going.

13
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,730
What matters is

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,150
who you're going with.

15
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,390
Next Christmas,

16
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,930
I'll take you places.

17
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,490
Sure!

18
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,289
I will wait.

19
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,710
Korn, what's that?

20
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,350
Someone might see us.

21
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,479
So what?

22
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,950
Can't I do that?

23
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,770
You little devil.

24
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,890
I'm cute, right?

25

[Until We Meet Again]

26
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,910
Time's up. Stop writing
and turn over your exam papers.

27
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,820
I think you should take a rest.

28
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,150
You cannot sleep these days, right?

29
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,880
Yeah.

30
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,070
I think

31
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,910
it's because of the exam
and also the swimming competition.

32
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,750
At night,

33
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,790
I can barely sleep.

34
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,530
Go back and rest now.

35
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,730
Let's go.

36
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,409
Manaow.

37
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,110
I couldn't finish one question.

38
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,710
I studied all day and night.

39
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,710
Come on.

40
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,090
Be careful. You might trip, Manaow.

41
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,310
Pharm!

42
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,450
I shouldn't have said that.

44
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,190
Dean.

45
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,410
Go!

46
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,790
Are you done with your exams?

47
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,610
How come you're here?

48
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,130
I'll take you to see the Christmas lights.

49
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,659
But

50
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,930
I'm still wearing my uniform.

51
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,290
I brought clothes for you.

52
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,570
Here.

53
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,110
They are actually my clothes.

54
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,310
How did you get it?

55
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,750
Right, Team.

56
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:59,420
Yes?

57
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,370
You have a competition
this Tuesday, right?

58
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Yes.

59
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,590
Why don't you go home and take a rest?

60
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,830
I will...

61
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,550
I'll let Win coach you.

62
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,910
Please...

63
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,760
Be kind to me.

64
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,770
Win is so freaking harsh on me.

65
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,430
Give me a break today.

66
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,200
Okay.

67
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,590
Take a rest.

68
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,590
I'd better go now.

69
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,210
Come with me.

70
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,180
Pharm.

71
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,770
See you.

72
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,810
Good luck.

73
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,100
Bye-bye.

74
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,310
Dean, goodbye.

75
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,680
You can do it!

76
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,220
Stop changing the topic.

77
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,630
You went into my room, didn't you?

78
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,090
Someone allowed me to.

79
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,170
Your mum called me this afternoon.

80
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,850
So I asked her for permission
to take you out.

81
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,840
We kept talking.

82
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,470
Your mum told me to get your clothes.

83
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,150
So we won't waste time.

84
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,450
These clothes.

85
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,650
Mum and Phoom helped me to choose.

86
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,830
Phoom?

87
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,320
Yes.

88
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,170
He probably saw that I kept
asking for her help.

89
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,590
He couldn't stand it.

90
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,170
So, he chose it himself.

91
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,730
Wait a second.

92
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,289
How did my mum know your number?

93
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,960
Dean!

94
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,590
How did she know that you have
the key to my room?

95
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,429
And when did you start
calling her "mum" too?

96
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,210
Dean.

97
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,430
Dean...

98
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,850
Yes?

99
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,310
Your key, please.

100
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,690
Very good,

101
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,050
my Santa.

102
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,890
Where is your car?

103
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,930
Stop avoiding the question.

104
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,430
I parked my car at your condo.

105
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,590
If I use my car today,
then we have to go separately.

106
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,070
What about your conversation with my mum?

107
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,200
According to the Principles of Business,

108
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,930
if I tell you, what will I get in return?

109
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,410
I will use credit first.

110
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,070
What's the redemption period?

111
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,730
I'll choose long-term credit ratings.

112
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,300
Long-term...

113
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,230
There is a risk that the debt
will not be repaid.

114
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,790
What will you use as insurance?

115
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,050
I will use

116
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,690
my status as your boyfriend.

117
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,190
Okay.

118
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,020
That sounds reliable.

119
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,950
I am your creditor.

120
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,470
You are my debtor.

121
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,470
There is no time limit for repayment.

122
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,200
But you're going to pay
in monthly instalments,

123
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,710
including interest.

124
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,430
Deal?

125
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,430
No?

126
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,690
I will change the deal then.

127
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,450
How about weekly payments?

128
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,810
With interest.

129
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,220
It should be monthly, not weekly.

130
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,290
Okay.

131
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,390
Deal.

132
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,830
Every month, then.

133
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,830
Okay.

134
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,770
Why did I suddenly become your debtor?

135
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,990
You're not even telling me about
your conversation with my mum.

136
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,090
You're such a cheater.

137
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,570
Are you seriously not going to tell me?

138
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,210
Nope.

139
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,170
Or are you going to pay
the interest first?

140
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,770
You're tricky.

141
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,500
It's beautiful.

142
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,720
Let's take photos.

143
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,120
Sure. I'll take it for you.

144
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,520
Okay.

145
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
Dean.

146
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,380
Dean...

147
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,060
Merry Christmas.

148
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,760
Merry Christmas to you too.

149
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,360
This New Year,

150
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,620
let's go to the temple.

151
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,240
And meet my parents too.

152
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,340
Let's go and meet your parents together.

153
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,780
I thought you said you like to see the
lights, but I see you keep eating.

154
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,220
What?

155
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,220
Can we sit here first?

156
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,500
My legs hurt.

157
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,300
You said you want to see the lights.

158
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,220
Last time you were telling us
about the story of the red thread, right?

159
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,700
Yes. Why?

160
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
How about...

161
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,880
The story behind the Christmas tradition.

162
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,620
No.

163
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,120
What is it?

164
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,580
They say any couple that kisses
underneath a mistletoe

165
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,040
will have a long and lasting love.

166
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,860
Where can we find a mistletoe?

167
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,760
Here. I brought it.

168
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,720
Are you brave enough?

169
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,130
Let's go.

170
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,000
My legs don't hurt anymore.

171
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,079
Quick.

172
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,780
Get up!

173
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
So freaking cute.

174
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,319
When are you coming back to Thailand?

175
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,810
[Probably after New Year.
But I'm not sure which month.]

176
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,880
[I heard Grandpa is sick.
I should go back and visit him soon.]

177
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,940
Grandpa?

178
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,450
[Yes. Your uncle called me.]

179
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,680
[Last time you met your grandpa,]

180
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,320
[you were around two years old.]

181
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,500
[Phoom's never met him before.]

182
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,510
Should I go and see Grandpa first?

183
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,720
[Let's wait until I get back.]

184
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
[Actually, your condo]

185
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,310
[belongs to your uncle.]

186
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,030
[He bought it for his son.]

187
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,130
Oh, no.

188
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,160
I'm stealing his room?

189
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,180
[Of course not.]

190
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,600
[The real owner of the room
is the same age as Phoom.]

191
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,120
[By the time he enters university,
you will graduate already.]

192
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,710
[By the way,]

193
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,060
[where is my son-in-law?]

194
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,500
What son-in-law?

195
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,960
Dean stays at his home, of course.

196
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,750
[He has the key to your room.]

197
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,850
[So, I thought you guys
moved in together.]

198
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,820
Of course not.

199
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,180
Right!

200
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,140
How did you know
he had the key to my room?

201
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,770
And how did you know his phone number?

202
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,160
[I have a spy.]

203
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,420
[Isn't my spy awesome?]

204
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,780
[Stop thinking about that.]

205
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,890
[I also know that he slept over
at your place before.]

206
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,360
Mum!

207
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
[Pharm.]

208
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,260
[I did not say anything because
you're a grown-up now.]

209
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,960
[You can make your own decision.]

210
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,460
[I trust your decision.]

211
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,090
[But remember,]

212
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,510
[whatever you do, you have to accept
the consequences.]

213
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,010
Thank you.

214
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,970
[Your name, Pharm, means strength.]

215
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,340
[You have that strength in you.]

216
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,220
[My son, you can stop being scared.]

217
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,960
[Your uncle gave you this name.]

218
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,410
My name...

219
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,160
My uncle gave me my name?

220
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
[That's what your father told me.]

221
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,430
[I don't remember the details.]

222
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,640
[You can ask your uncle
when you meet him.]

223
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay.

224
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,000
I will sleep now.

225
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,900
[Okay.]

226
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,660
Good night, Mum.

227
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,120
What are you doing?

228
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,380
Just

229
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,580
tying the red thread.

230
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,580
You're always fooling around.

231
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,500
Do you know?

232
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,080
Some people believe that

233
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,810
tying a red thread around
our wrists like this

234
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,400
is a bad omen.

235
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,380
But

236
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,080
I heard the girls say

237
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,980
the red thread would tie lovers together.

238
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,360
That's why I'm tying it around our wrists.

239
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,090
Whatever.

240
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,100
It's just a belief.

241
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,300
I will make you believe.

242
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,910
This is the red thread promise.

243
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,400
It will tie us together.

244
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,080
So cheesy.

245
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,680
You don't have to tie our wrists.

246
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,360
I'm not going anywhere.

247
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,340
We will be together.

248
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,240
Forever.

249
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,100
What page are you at now?

250
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,640
Page 60.

251
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,850
Is it fun?

252
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,700
Of course.

253
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,420
Do you want to read it together?

254
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,580
No, thanks.

255
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,650
In.

256
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,750
Are you tired?

257
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,030
What are you thinking?

258
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,010
I'm asking you. What are you thinking?

259
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,550
We made a promise, didn't we?

260
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,550
We promised that we would stay together.

261
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,970
You made a promise.

262
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,940
Please.

263
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,250
Don't leave me.

264
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,370
I love you.

265
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,050
Remember this.

266
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,290
I love you so much.

267
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,410
Korn...

268
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,740
If you love me, you have to stay with me.

269
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,790
Don't leave me here.

270
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,410
Please stay with me.

271
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,310
Korn, don't leave me.

272
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,830
How will I live without you?

273
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,210
Korn!

274
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,710
Let's see who's in the competition.

275
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,650
Here.

276
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,780
Dean's in this competition.

277
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,670
Really?

278
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,460
There are

279
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,850
freestyle, butterfly stroke, breaststroke,

280
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,980
backstroke...

281
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,270
Backstroke!

282
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,330
What's wrong with Pharm?

283
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,630
He seems distracted.

284
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,820
Pharm, are you okay?

285
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,450
I'm fine.

286
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,850
Dean and his team are here.

287
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,600
Dean.

288
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,930
Good luck.

289
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,250
Hello, Dean.

290
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,970
Dean.

291
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,390
What's wrong?

292
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,490
Did you cry?

293
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,450
I had a dream again.

294
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,380
You don't have to worry.

295
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,190
You must concentrate on your game.

296
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,680
Understand?

297
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,910
If I win,

298
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,890
will you give me a reward?

299
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,940
Eh?

300
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,150
I want a reward from you.

301
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,370
You're such a cheater.

302
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,470
Will you give it to me?

303
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,110
I will give you just a tiny bit.

304
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,600
I have a reward for you too.

305
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,670
Not that...

306
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,490
What I'm going to give you
is an actual reward,

307
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,690
not the same as what you will give me.

308
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,690
How do you know what reward
I will give you?

309
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,590
You want me to say it?

310
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,730
Dean...

311
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,280
You guys are just too much.

312
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,500
We should go inside now.

313
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,270
The competition will start soon.

314
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,810
Hello, Pharm.

315
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:57,890
Well,

316
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,040
I have to go.

317
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,970
You can do it.

318
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,790
I'll punch you if you lose.

319
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,030
Good luck.

320
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,790
Well...

321
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,030
What?

322
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,640
What's that about?

323
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,050
Should we go in first?

324
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,750
Let's go.

325
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,390
You're not moving.

326
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,220
You're not moving.
All you're doing is blush...

327
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,020
What's wrong?

328
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,670
Nothing's wrong.

329
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,730
He's leading.

330
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,930
Go!

331
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,670
I'm never wrong.

332
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,890
He's the best.

333
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,520
Aren't you happy?

334
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,230
Dean won.

335
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,220
Did you see that?

336
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,720
Of course!

337
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,320
Everyone ditched me right after
Dean competed.

338
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,090
Anyway,

339
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,550
where should I go this New Year?

340
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,130
Pharm and Dean are going to the temple.

341
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,260
Del is visiting her grandma.

342
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,710
What about me...

343
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,110
You're not watching where
you're going again, Manaow.

344
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,170
I'm so sorry.

345
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,429
I was just...

346
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,800
Anyway,

347
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,949
congratulations on winning a medal!

348
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,330
It's only second place.

349
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,659
Come on.

350
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,400
It doesn't matter what place you got.

351
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,530
You still got a medal.

352
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,210
Anyway,

353
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,050
keep it up.

354
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,750
I'm here to support you.

355

Keep it up!

357
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,500
I have to go. Bye!

358
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,050
You can do it!

359

Manaow!

360
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,470
She's so strong.

361
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,070
Manaow...

362
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,350
Dean.

363
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:55,880
Well,

364
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,930
you can wait here.

365
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,590
Okay.

366
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,970
I know I'm still dirty,
but don't stare at me like that.

367
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,330
Dean!

368
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,850
You're cute.

369
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,550
That's why I'm staring.

370
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,530
Give me five minutes to get changed.

371
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,350
I'm not letting you go

372
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,140
until you give me your
monthly payment plus interest.

373
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,350
What?

374
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,690
It's nearly the end of December.

375
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,280
You promised me.

376
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,130
You will pay me back
every month with interest.

377
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,190
But we have to go out and buy things soon.

378
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,150
It's only 11 a.m.

379
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,370
The mall is not open yet.

380
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,980
Dean...

381
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,440
Stop it.

382
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,740
Stop being tricky.

383
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,340
You haven't told me about
your conversation with my mum.

384
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,170
Dean.

385
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,830
You seriously want me
to pay back, don't you?

386
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,330
You know it.

387
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,450
Good job.

388
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,520
I paid already.

389
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,390
Dean!

390
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,510
Dean.

391
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,240
Dean, stop it.

392
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,250
No.

393
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,110
Dean.

394
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,400
I love you.

395
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,550
Do you still want to go out?

396
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,710
We can go another day.

397
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,050
Are you hungry?

398
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,030
I'm sorry.

399
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,270
Are you hungry?

400
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,500
I will find something for you to eat.

401
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,970
Don't.

402
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,770
This meal.

403
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,340
Let me make it for you.

404
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,530
All you have to do is sit and wait.

405
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,270
Your kitchen is too small.

406
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,510
If we're going to build a house,

407
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,830
I'll make the kitchen bigger.

408
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,060
I will make more cabinets too.

409
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,710
So you can have more space
to store your utensils.

410
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,190
Actually, no.

411
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,370
I'll let you design it yourself.

412
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,730
Do you think that's a good idea?

413
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,810
Pharm?

414
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,340
What's wrong?

415
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,630
Nothing.

416
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,440
Thank you.

417
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,690
The food.

418
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,850
Where did you buy it?

419
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,650
Try it first.

420
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,290
Today is your birthday.

421
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,410
Is there anything you want to eat?

422
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,230
How about

423
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,890
sour curry with vegetable omelette?

424
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,610
And

425
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,630
Thai five-spice pork stew with eggs?

426
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,470
Sure.

427
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,130
I will make it for you.

428
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,670
I will go and come back
as soon as possible.

429
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,070
I love you.

430
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,310
Dean.

431
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,710
Do you want to meet her?

432
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,330
This is your reward

433
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,870
for passing the exam.

434
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,830
You can choose

435
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,690
whether to meet her or not.

436
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,730
Whatever you choose,

437
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,360
I will always be here right beside you.

438
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,050
I will go and meet her.

439
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,340
If you are going to meet her,

440
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,030
you have to know more about the past.

441
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,010
You will be by my side, right?

442
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,310
I will be right beside you.

443
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,050
Then,

444
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,070
there is nothing to be afraid of.

445
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,910
Okay.

446
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,800
Let's eat.

447
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,270
Okay.

448
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,160
It's very delicious.

Come on. Get up!

453
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,390
I don't want to eat. I'm fat.

454
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,210
Look at my face.
Manaow said my face is chubby.

455
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,290
I look like a steamed bun.

456
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,290
Why are you worried?

457
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,550
There is an easy way out.

No. I'm afraid.

What are you afraid of?

465
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,490
No need to worry about
the quality of APEX.

466
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,880
I won't let you go
to a random clinic.

467
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,520
APEX?

468
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,530
That sounds familiar. I think I heard
Manaow talk about it.

469
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,890
Don't they focus on body slimming?
