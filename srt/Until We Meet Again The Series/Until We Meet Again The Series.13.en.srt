00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,000
Please?

178
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,050
You're such a cheater.

179
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,060
Let's go.

180
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,870
You can take a shower first.

181
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,810
I can help you in the shower.

182
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,770
It's okay!

183
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,310
I guess he needs more practice.

184
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,860
Be careful.

185
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,270
I am enjoying the view.

186
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,810
The weather is so nice.

187
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,750
I'm glad that you enjoy it.

188
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,810
Take a break from city life.

189
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,370
I haven't seen Team and Win.

190
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,280
They're probably still sleeping.

191
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,450
I think

192
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,590
they had a rough night.

193
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,170
Let's come back here again.

194
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,010
Just the two of us.

195
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,590
Okay.

196
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,290
What are you looking at?

197
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,920
Hey guys! Right here.

198
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,850
Pharm.

199
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,650
Let's get something to eat.

200
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,530
I'll get something for you to eat then.

201
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,530
Okay.

202
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,430
Let's go.

203
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,730
Last night,

204
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,650
did you do something to him?

205
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,630
You're so evil.

206
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,170
Just eat your breakfast.

207
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,230
For you.

208
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,660
Thank you.

209
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,830
Here.

210
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,820
Dope up.

211
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,550
Yeah. Dope up.

212
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,410
Dude.

213
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,210
Do you want to have some?

214
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,730
No, thanks. I can't finish
the whole thing.

215
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,020
We're going to the waterfall.

216
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,870
You will be too exhausted.

217
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,330
Why would I be too exhausted?

218
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,330
He's cute.

219
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,030
Did you do some exercise last night?

220
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,230
If you don't have enough protein,

221
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,930
you will be dead tired.

222
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,970
What the hell?

223
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,470
I knew it.

224
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,590
How did you know?

225
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,140
Calm down.

226
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,150
You're turning red.

227
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,940
I just knew it.

228
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,650
Anyway,

229
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,870
only me and Win know.

230
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,710
Other people still have no clue.

231
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,080
You can trust me on that.

232
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,310
But

233
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,680
nothing happened last night.

234
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,830
Don't.

235
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,060
Don't lie to me.

236
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,380
Just a little bit.

237
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,860
Not to that extent.

238
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,650
Stop making excuses.

239
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,440
Here's the egg.

240
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,300
I'll peel it for you.

241
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,760
Do I seriously have to eat it?

242
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,120
It's protein for your body.

243
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,100
You have to eat it.

244
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,650
You're not going to eat something else?

245
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,820
Not yet.

246
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,270
I'm waiting...

247
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,410
Eat it.

248
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,370
Eat it.

249
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,730
Take it.

250
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,380
That's it.

251
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,080
Eat it slowly.

252
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,330
Pharm.

253
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,490
Do you want to eat a sausage too?

254
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,220
Darn you, Win.

255
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,880
I just want him to eat a sausage too.

256
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,720
Or do you want him to eat yours?

257
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,930
Pocketing food again?

258
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,710
Win, just finish your egg.

259
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,980
It's beautiful.

260
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,370
The weather is so nice.

261
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,760
Look at this.

262
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,150
They went to the beach
and didn't even invite us.

263
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,420
But we're here right now.

264
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,150
Which level of the waterfall are we going?

265
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,910
I want to go to the fourth level,

266
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,310
called "Oke Nang Phee Sue”.

267
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,780
There are natural water slides.

268
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,790
You did some research, didn't you?

269
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,390
Let's go.

270
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,590
I feel so sorry for you.

271
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,410
Your boyfriend just ditched you.

272
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,250
Just let him be.

273
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,790
Let's go.

274
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,670
Let's go, guys. Wake up!

275
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,470
Come on.

276
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,600
Be careful, Team.

277
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,530
Thank you.

278
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,020
Careful.

279
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,700
Walk slowly.

280
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,250
Should we do that too?

281
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,570
What?

282
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,610
I can walk by myself.

283
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,850
Thanks.

284
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,180
Guys,

285
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,370
let's go to the higher level.
The view is nicer there.

286
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,650
It's so cold.

287
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,940
This shirt is getting in my way.

288
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,050
What?

289
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,210
Why are you so dumb?

290
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,240
Why?

291
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,810
Didn't you see them when you took
a shower this morning?

292
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,830
See what?

293
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,170
Those marks on your body.

294
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,980
Oh, shoot!

295
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,330
My club president is amazing, isn't he?

296
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,220
You said you were going to protect me.

297
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,270
All you do is hand me over to him.

298
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,840
He's the one you love.

299
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,850
Or else I wouldn't be this supportive.

300
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,140
But

301
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,410
don't get carried away.

302
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,970
Those guys.

303
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,960
They seem harmless.

304
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,970
But whenever they see
a chance, they will take it.

305
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,170
Those guys?

306
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,410
Yes.

307
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,820
Those guys.

308
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,190
Team.

309
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,620
What's that behind your neck?

310
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,550
What?

311
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,370
Wait. There's a red mark.

312
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,600
What mark?

313
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,540
I don't know either.

314
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,160
It's red here.

315
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,330
It's probably a mosquito bite.

316
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,270
I stayed quite late on the raft last
night before I went back to my room.

317
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,130
I see.

318
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,500
Darn you!

319
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,440
You made a mark on my neck.

320
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,290
Let's play.

321
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,460
You go first.

322
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,600
Let's go together.

323
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,910
No!

324
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,930
It's cold!

325
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,450
Put your shirt here.

326
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,250
Fish!

327
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,230
Don't step on the fish.

328
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,140
Why don't you go in?

329
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,170
The fish are nibbling my legs.

330
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,870
Just get into the water.

331
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,970
It's cold!

332
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,750
Pharm.

333
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,400
Dean.

334
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,030
Are you enjoying it?

335
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,430
Thank you.

336
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,870
Thank you for taking me here.

337
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,800
I'm having so much fun.

338
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm glad you enjoy it.

339
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,970
When we go back to Bangkok,

340
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,320
is there anything you want to eat?
I will make it specially for you.

341
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,330
Can I have another reward?

342
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,950
Another reward?

343
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,960
What are you thinking?

344
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,940
I just want you to sleep over at my house.

345
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,120
Only a sleepover, right?

346
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,760
Of course.

347
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,530
Or

348
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,580
do you want me to do something else?

349
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,760
Dean!

350
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,300
So, will you go to my house?

351
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,400
If it's just a sleepover, then I will go.

352
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,080
Okay.

353
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,470
There are many people around us.

354
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,940
It's okay.

355
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,820
Let's play.

356
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,370
The water is so cold.

357
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,409
Hello, Mum.

358
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,350
[Pharm, are you still on a trip?]

359
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,420
Yes.

360
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,650
Is there something wrong?

361
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,570
It's still late at night
over there, right?

362
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,270
[I got an urgent call.]

363
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,280
[Your uncle told me that your grandpa
is not feeling well.]

364
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,290
[Can you go and see him first?]

365
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,790
Sure, Mum.

366
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,530
You can send me the address.
I can go there by myself.

367
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,090
[Uncle said your cousin will pick you up.]

368
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,410
[I already gave him your number.]

369
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,850
[He will probably call you soon.]

370
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,160
[Please visit him for me.]

371
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,910
[After I finish the business here,]

372
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,610
[I will go there right away.]

373
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,250
Sure, Mum.

374
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,960
Goodbye.

375
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,270
Uncle and Grandpa...

376
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,420
Let's get out.

377
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,390
Let's go.

378
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,410
Come on.

379
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,020
Check your belongings too.

380
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,970
Let's go back home.

381
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,290
Okay.

382
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,750
Finally, you're back.

383
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,830
Mum!

384
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:15,480
[Side story]

385
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,220
What are you doing?

386
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,790
You're still awake?

387
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,450
Obviously.

388
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,090
You're eating it again.

389
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,130
You keep eating Lay's.

390
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,630
I like it.

391
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,140
I exercise after eating it though.

392
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,170
Win.

393
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,290
It's so yummy.

394
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,220
You should try it.

395
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,560
I will share it with you.

396
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,460
You want me to eat it that badly, huh?

397
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,860
Here.

398
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,220
It's really yummy.

399
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,470
Share it with me too!

400
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,310
Are you going to finish it all
by yourself?

401
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,320
I'm not sharing it with you anymore.

402
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,690
You want me to do it again?

403
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,090
Go away.

404
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,970
This Lay's is so good.

405
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:10,650
[Next episode]

406
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,190
I love you.

407
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,970
You probably feel exhausted after crying.

408
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,600
Eat it while it's still hot.

409
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,950
Let's talk later.
