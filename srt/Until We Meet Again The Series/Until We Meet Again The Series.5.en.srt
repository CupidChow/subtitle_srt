[Until We Meet Again]

3
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,870
I'm sorry about what just happened.

4
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,490
About what?

5
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,910
I...

6
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,720
I was talking nonsense.

7
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,710
And my symptom occurred.

8
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,910
There is no need to recall

9
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,990
something that shouldn't
be remembered.

10
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,990
I don't know why my symptom
suddenly occurred again.

11
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,490
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

12
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,980
We're lucky.

13
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,890
At least it happened when I'm here.

14
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,610
But I'm kind of mad.

15
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,960
I didn't get to eat
another bowl of porridge.

16
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,070
Do you want me to make it for you again?

17
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,230
The fruits.

18
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,750
Yes?

19
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,700
I prepared this for you.

20
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,310
Right.

21
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,010
I want to eat it.

22
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,240
Here.

23
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,490
I'm driving.

24
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,100
My hands aren't free.

25
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,930
I want to finish eating
before we reach the university.

26
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,730
Dean!

27
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,380
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,900
I won't tease you anymore.

29
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,090
I've just noticed something.

30
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,010
What is it?

31
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,690
We drive the same brand of car.

32
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,990
Win told me that I am
an aggressive driver.

33
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,700
How come?

34
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,700
Do you know which model I'm using?

35
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,990
Nissan Almera.

36
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,490
You know aggressive drivers

37
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,490
will drive Nissan "Al-Me-Ra”.

38
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,990
Almera...

39
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,960
Aow-Mai-Ra? (You want to mess with me?)

40
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,250
Your joke is so lame.

41
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,690
Dean,

42
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,270
you don't have to pick me up anymore.

43
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,290
Why not?

44
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,890
Because

45
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,890
my car is fixed already.

46
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,480
Also, I don't want to bother you.

47
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,390
Are you uncomfortable

48
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,570
that I go to your room every day?

49
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,210
Not at all.

50
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,290
I never felt uncomfortable.

51
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,730
Then,

52
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,430
why won't you let me pick you up?

53
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,900
It's Del.

54
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,790
You come to have breakfast with me.

55
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,210
That means you won't have
time for your siblings, right?

56
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,290
They want to bond with you.

57
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,290
Breakfast is the only time
that you are all together.

58
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,790
I don't want to be the person
who ruins that moment.

59
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,290
Don't leave them just like that.

60
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,790
I beg you.

61
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,290
I'm a really bad brother, right?

62
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,210
Of course not.

63
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,290
You just don't know what to do.

64
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,210
Del told me that you guys
were raised separately.

65
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,200
You guys met when you all are older.

66
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,560
Maybe that's why you don't
know how to act around them.

67
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,290
I have 16 years of experience in being
an older brother. I will teach you how.

68
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,200
Right.

69
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,290
Tell me how, brother.

70
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,710
Start talking.

71
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,340
If they are too afraid to start
a conversation, you should do it.

72
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,830
Listen to them.

73
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Give them some advice.

74
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,290
Spend more time with them.

75
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,890
Let me guess.

76
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,700
You guys never hang out together, right?

77
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,790
That's right.

78
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,290
It's not hard.

79
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,130
Just start talking and
spending time together.

80
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,210
So you get to know what they like.

81
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,710
Blood is thicker than water.

82
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,790
You'll surely become closer.

83
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,290
But I'm a bit sad.

84
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,680
I won't get to eat
breakfast with you anymore.

85
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,210
Let's go.

86
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,290
We will be late.

87
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,490
Dean.

88
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,630
It's true that we cannot
eat breakfast together.

89
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,210
But there's lunch,

90
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,210
dinner,

91
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,290
or holiday.

92
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,780
We can still see each other, right?

93
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,040
That's Pharm.

94
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,930
He's the real culprit.

95
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,950
Their relationship is progressing.

96
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
How come we know
this through social media?

97
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,580
We have to clear it up with him.

98
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,680
Just wait.

99
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,670
He's here.

100
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,670
Why is everyone looking at me?

101
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,850
You want to know?

102
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,360
Here.

103
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,550
Of course!

104
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,040
What?

105
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,040
You don't need our help anymore.

106
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,960
What are you talking about?

107
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,540
It's not like that...

108
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
I'm joking.

109
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,460
I'm not angry at you.

110
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,040
I'm just kidding.

111
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
But

112
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
you should let us know where you're going.

113
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,040
So we don't have to worry.

114
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,950
By the way,

115
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,720
when did he secretly start picking
you up and dropping you off?

116
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,460
What secret?

117
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
It's not a secret.

118
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,960
I think

119
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,540
DeanPharm is becoming a thing
because people are sharing photos.

120
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Photos?

121
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,540
What photos?

122
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,040
The photo of you feeding him.

123
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,300
This is bad.

124
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,210
I fed so many people.

125
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,950
Why would they only take photos
of me and him?

126
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,350
Will Dean's fans attack me?

127
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,460
I don't think so.

128
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,540
Dean's fans like you very much.

129
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,040
How do you know?

130
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,040
I'm not lying. I have evidence.

131
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,950
Here.

132
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
DeanPharm secret group chat.

133
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,960
At first,

134
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,460
it was just Dean's fan club.

135
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,040
But now they've added Pharm too.

136
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,030
You're the exceptional person.

137
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Pharm.

138
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,540
Manaow!

139
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,680
Stop it.

140
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,120
Please, please, please.

141
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
Let me take some.

142
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,950
So many people want your photos!

143
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,950
I will ask for your permission
before I share your photos. I promise!

144
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,720
Who will want a photo of me?

145
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,030
Poor Manaow.

146
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,750
Of course, Pharm knows nothing.

147
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,040
Except things on the
Swimming Club's Facebook page.

148
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,450
And Dean's Facebook.

149
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Team!

150
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,500
Hey, my friend.

151
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,830
If you have some spare time,

152
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,960
please check out
our university's web board

153
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,950
and the Cute Boy Page.

154
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,540
There are so many photos of you.

155
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,100
Let me go!

156
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Can you stop hurting me?

157
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,450
Why are you so cute?

158
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,040
What are you doing?

159
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,540
Stop it!

160
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,040
How come there are still
TeamPharm shippers?

161
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,670
They are so outdated.

162
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,840
So...

163
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,960
Can I upload your photos?

164
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,950
If I can't,

165
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
it's okay.

166
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,960
I've taken many photos already.

167
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,780
But it's okay.

168
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,570
I'm okay, but I took the photos already.

169
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,040
It's okay if you don't want
me to share the photos.

170
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,960
I won't feel anything.

171
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,290
I just think you're cute.

172
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,960
Go big or go home.

173
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,360
Your photo is so cute.

174
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,490
More acting!

175
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,960
Can I?

176
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,530
It's up to you.

177
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,450
You let me act for so long.

178
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,450
You are the best!

179
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,950
Just don't post it everywhere.

180
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,540
Of course not.

181
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,950
So cute!

182
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
I won't post it everywhere.

183
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,540
Isn't this cute?

184
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,360
This is not cute at all.

185
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,510
It's a candid photo.

186
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,900
This is a good photo.

187
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,800
It is not!

188
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,720
How cute!

189
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,960
Can you take it again?

190
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,960
I like this one.

191
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
This one is cute.

192
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
What's wrong?

193
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,270
Are you sick?

194
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,780
Nothing.

195
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,700
I...

196
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,350
You're not in a hurry today?

197
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
No.

198
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,670
I will eat breakfast with you two.

199
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,570
So...

200
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,360
Why are you guys not eating yet?

201
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,360
Because

202
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,170
Del told me to wait for you.

203
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,780
Could you bring it, please?

204
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,710
Okay.

205
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,170
Rice soup with pork ribs?

206
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,670
Who made this?

207
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,080
Del made all this by herself.

208
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,670
Del said she wants her
brothers to try her cooking.

209
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,330
Eat it before it gets cold.

210
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,540
Please.

211
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Very delicious.

212
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,960
Delicious.

213
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
I like it.

214
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,950
I asked my friend to help me.

215
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
I tried making it so many times.

216
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,040
Which friend?

217
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
My friend from the cooking club.

218
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Is she cute?

219
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Why?

220
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,040
Are you interested?

221
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,960
If she can teach you
how to cook this well,

222
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,040
she must be an amazing person.

223
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,040
Of course I'm interested.

224
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,330
I think you're too late.

225
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,720
Someone's got eyes on my friend already.

226
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,040
Right, Dean?

227
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,540
You know her?

228
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,450
Ronnarit.

229
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Ronnaporn.

230
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,400
Finish your breakfast so we can go.

231
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Yes, sir.

232
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,950
Del,

233
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,310
who texted you?

234
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,460
[Pharm: How was it?]

235
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,540
[Del: They love it. Thank you so much.]

236
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
[Sunday]

237
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,960
This piece should be here.

238
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,950
Why did you cut it?

239
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,960
I don't know!

240
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,950
Darn you.

241
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,960
Why didn't you follow the template?

242
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,950
Should we do it again?

243
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,960
You have to buy a new one for me.

244
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,450
[Again?]

245
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,460
You pay!

246
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,950
Help me fix this too!

247
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,450
You have to help me, okay?

248
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,950
Okay!

249
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,960
[I planned to wake up late.]

250
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,950
[This is so annoying!]

251
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,960
It doesn't fit anymore!

252
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,950
Stop arguing.

253
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,040
We're in the same group.

254
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,960
It's just six o'clock!

255
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Fine, I'll go buy a new one.

256
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,450
Go!

257
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,040
And come back quickly!

258
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,540
[Please keep your voice down.
From Room 802.]

259
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,040
[Sorry about the loud noise.
From Room 801.]

260
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,670
Who should I go with?

261
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Dean!

262
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,300
Hello, Dean.

263
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,350
[Why do you sound so surprised?]

264
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:33,040
I was going to text you,
but you called me first.

265
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,590
[What's the matter?]

266
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,320
Nothing. Is there
anything I can do for you?

267
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,780
[What time does your class finish?]

268
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,960
My class got cancelled today.

269
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,370
I'm free all day.

270
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,240
[I don't have any classes either.]

271
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,410
[Do you want to go and
have lunch together?]

272
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,450
[My friend just opened
a restaurant at Siam.]

273
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,380
[He wants us to come over.]

274
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,540
I'd love to.

275
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,510
Okay.

276
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,920
[Team: Wow. You're moving to the next
level. You're going on a date now.]

277
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,040
[Pharm: We're just going out for lunch!]

278
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,010
[Team: Right. Just lunch.
What time are you going?]

279
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,170
[Pharm: Dean is picking me up soon.]

280
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,520
[Team: It's still early.
Why are you in such a hurry?]

281
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,960
[Team: I don't think the
shops are open now.]

282
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,080
[Team: I've got an idea.]

283
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,010
[Team: You've got a lot of time.
Why don't you guys take a bus?]

284
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,690
[Pharm: A bus?]

285
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,510
[Team: It's convenient and cheap!]

286
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,290
[Team: Most importantly, you'll spend more
time together because of the traffic.]

287
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,990
[Pharm: You sound like
you've done it before.]

288
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,990
[Team: I'm sleepy.
I'll go back to sleep now.]

289
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,680
[Pharm: Hey, Team!]

290
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,730
[Pharm: Team!]

291
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,690
Dean.

292
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,670
[I'm here.]

293
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,770
Dean,

294
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,330
do you want to go there by bus?

295
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,770
Is there something weird?

296
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,670
Nothing.

297
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,350
I'm just surprised.

298
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,990
You suddenly asked me to take the bus.

299
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,920
I

300
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,010
just wanted a change of scenery.

301
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,570
Also,

302
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,990
it's been a while since I took the bus.

303
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,420
Pharm.

304
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,910
Yes?

305
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,560
Sorn.

306
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,690
Hey, Dean.

307
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,090
How are you?

308
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,050
I'm good.

309
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,390
Who's here with you?

310
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,190
This is Pharm.

311
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,100
Hello, Pharm.

312
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,120
My name is Sorn. I'm the owner
of this restaurant.

313
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,590
I'm also Dean's old friend.

314
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,590
Just call me Sorn.

315
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,680
Feel free to order anything.

316
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,770
Dean will pay for you.

317
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,770
Hello, Sorn.

318
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,890
You can take him to sit over there first.

319
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,930
Okay.

320
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,890
I'll get the menu for you.

321
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Is it good?

322
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,390
It's so good.

323
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,850
Try this one.

324
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,650
You can feed him.

325
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,110
I will pretend that I didn't see anything.

326
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,740
I wasn't going to...

327
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,490
Do you know?

328
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,790
Dean stayed with his
grandmother since he was a little kid.

329
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,280
His personality is similar
to his grandmother's.

330
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,190
He likes to eat Thai food.

331
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,280
He's very neat.

332
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,940
When he was around two years old,

333
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,130
his parents were going
to take him back home.

334
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,050
Right?

335
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,970
But Dean didn't want to go back.

336
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,790
When his parents left,

337
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,880
he was crying alone in the garden.

338
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,490
It was ages ago. How can anyone remember?

339
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,490
You were young too.

340
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,590
How can you remember?

341
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,490
My mum remembers.

342
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,490
She likes you so much,
Dean from next door.

343
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,580
She always talks about you.

344
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,860
My mum asked him why he cried.

345
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,770
This two-year-old kid
said he missed his parents.

346
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,460
But he felt sad for his grandmother.
He didn't want to leave her alone.

347
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,530
That was why he didn't go home.

348
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,010
You were so cute.

349
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,990
There's nothing cute about this.

350
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,340
Okay.

351
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,130
Let's continue eating.

352
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,990
You found that person, right?

353
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,420
I did.

354
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,780
Let me treat you guys, then.

355
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,850
My old friend brought his
important person to meet me.

356
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,930
I should treat him well.

357
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,920
Thank you so much.

358
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,610
I will leave, then. I have
to look after the restaurant.

359
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,590
Thank you so much.

360
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,670
You're welcome.

361
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,920
Pharm,

362
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,080
after this,

363
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,680
do you want to go anywhere?

364
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,260
I want to go

365
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,570
to Ocean World.

366
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,090
The water park?

367
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,210
The aquarium.

368
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,290
It's at Siam Paragon.

369
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,280
I've heard about it,
but I've never been there.

370
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,850
Let's go.

371
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,590
I want to go too.

372
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,620
Okay.

373
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,590
Eat a lot more.

374
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,890
You should eat too.

375
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,490
Do you want anything else?

376
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,880
Thank you.

377
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,090
Two tickets, please.

378
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,000
Two people.

379
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,400
Yes.

380
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,490
Here's the map and the show schedule.

381
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,910
Thank you.

382
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,460
Right that way.

383
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,130
Let's go.

384
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,910
Let me hold that for you.

385
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,490
Thank you.

386
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,680
Penguins.

387
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,300
Look at them.

388
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,690
They're so cute.

389
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,160
They walk like this.

390
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,170
How?

391
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,760
Can you show me again?

392
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,180
Like this.

393
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,980
What are you doing?

394
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,090
I didn't do anything.

395
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,100
Don't tell me you were taking photos.

396
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,590
Delete it now.

397
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,890
This is so embarrassing.

398
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,490
I won't take photos anymore.

399
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,720
They're walking away now.

400
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,430
Let's go over there.

401
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,100
Let's go.

402
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,320
Dean,

403
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,400
come here. Take a look!

404
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,480
Beautiful!

405
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,290
Phra Aphai Mani.

406
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,730
Every time I read Phra Aphai Mani,

407
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,570
I feel so sorry for the Sea Ogress.

408
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,680
She loves Phra Aphai Mani,
but he abandons her.

409
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,130
Literature is always like that.

410
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,170
If you're the Sea Ogress,

411
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,320
what will you do to him and
his new lover, the Mermaid?

412
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,970
I'm quite selfish.

413
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,420
I will eat the Mermaid
and lock Phra Aphai Mani up again.

414
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,670
How about you?

415
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,170
What will you do?

416
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,250
I will eat both of them.

417
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,340
I don't like players.

418
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,770
If he's going to have many lovers,

419
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,020
I'll just eat him too.

420
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,330
So he will be mine only.

421
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,990
You're quite fierce.

422
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,280
But it's okay.

423
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,500
I can assure you,

424
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,170
I'm not a player.

425
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,490
What are you afraid of?

426
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,090
I'm just afraid.

427
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,730
Do you trust me?

428
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,170
You don't have to be afraid.

429
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,290
Not anymore.

430
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,890
Mum! This fish is so pretty.

431
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,240
Pharm.

432
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,330
Pharm.

433
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,710
Dean.

434
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,130
Yes?

435
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,090
Do you like to eat grilled fish?

436
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
Grilled fish?

437
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,170
How could I ask him that question?

438
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,180
Please wait.

439
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,820
No need to hurry.

440
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,040
Thank you.

441
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,760
Which floor?

442
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,330
Eighth floor, please.

443
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,640
Same floor!

444
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,700
That room is yours?

445
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,490
What a coincidence!

446
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,390
Sorry that my juniors
always make loud noises.

447
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,810
It's okay.

448
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,880
It's not that loud anymore.

449
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,890
Thank you for the snacks.

450
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:28,090
After I scolded them, they quickly
found the snacks for you.

451
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,460
My name is Silp. I'm 25 years old.

452
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,730
I am an architect.

453
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,250
Nice to meet you.

454
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,170
I'm Pharm.

455
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,240
I'm 19 years old.

456
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,920
I'm a fresher.

457
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,160
A fresher?

458
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,420
Where do you study?

459
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,880
Pinyo University.

460
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,510
Pinyo University.

461
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,530
I also graduated from that university.

462
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,920
All my juniors are
from that university too.

463
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,200
I will introduce them to
you when they come over.

464
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,520
Sure.

465
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,610
I'll see you around then.

466
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,700
See you!

467
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,150
[Pharm, the cutest fresher ever.
He's with Dean? They went on a date!]

468
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,590
[Arggghhh! Text me back now!]

469
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,810
[You guys, check Dean's Facebook!]

470
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,890
[Love is in the air! They are dating!]

471
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,920
[Found this excited boy under the sea.]

472
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,370
Why did you give up so easily?

473
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,370
I'm hungry.

474
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,370
I thought your sister
made breakfast for you?

475
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,290
She woke up late today.

476
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,280
None of us had breakfast.

477
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,370
I think I will buy something to eat later.

478
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,220
By the time you finish packing,

479
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,860
there will be no food left.

480
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,990
I'll just wait for lunch, then.

481
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,180
You will starve to death.

482
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,130
I saw that you have Lay's in your locker.

483
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,410
Give it to me, then.

484
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,420
No way.

485
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,450
I'll let you starve yourself.

486
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,610
Dean.

487
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,370
Dean!

488
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,380
You jerk!

489
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,450
It hurts!

490
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,090
-Are you giving it or not?
-No.

491
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,790
I won't give it to you.

492
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,690
I thought you have a class?

493
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
I do. My class will start in ten minutes.

494
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,140
But

495
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,300
I'm here to drop someone off.

496
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,300
Del told me you didn't
have breakfast this morning.

497
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,180
He made it for you.

498
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,520
I don't know what he made.

499
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,890
He won't let me see it.

500
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,860
Can you open it?

501
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,390
I want to see it too.

502
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,340
I didn't have that much time to make it.

503
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,600
Amazing!

504
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,400
I thought you said you didn't have time?

505
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,620
Why is mine just a normal sandwich?

506
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,460
You ordered it yourself.

507
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,570
What kind of bread is this?

508
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,650
It looks like a pocket.

509
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,010
It's Pita bread.

510
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,350
It's similar to kebab bread.

511
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,250
You just cut it in half
and add the filling inside.

512
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,690
I see that you have a
lot of practice going on.

513
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,200
So, I made black pepper chicken
and boiled shrimp fillings for you.

514
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,050
Thank you.

515
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,050
Just eat it quickly.
The class will start soon.

516
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,260
I'm leaving, then.

517
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,590
We will go now.

518
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,250
Wait!

519
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,060
At lunch time,

520
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,090
let's meet at the canteen.

521
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,030
Okay.

522
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,760
Korn,

523
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,510
I will wait for you at the canteen.

524
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,160
Why are you so stubborn?

525
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,490
I will wait until you come.

526
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,780
In!

527
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,310
In.

528
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,240
In.

529
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,410
You've finally come.

530
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,600
Dean.

531
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:11,490
Dean.

532
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,140
Dean!

533
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,900
What's wrong with you?

534
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,710
You didn't respond
when I called your name.

535
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Nothing.

536
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,570
I just feel like I've forgotten something.

537
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,560
But

538
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,570
you just said "In”.

539
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,210
What's that about?

540
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:47,780
[Side story]

00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,770
When will Pharm come?

542
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,770
Why is he so late?

543
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,220
Pharm.

544
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,410
I'm sorry.

545
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,810
You're late. Do you have
a lot of work today?

546
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,410
Yes. I have to make a lot of desserts.

547
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,400
We've been starving.

548
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,710
You guys haven't eaten yet?

549
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,000
Not yet.

550
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,090
We are waiting for you.

551
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,950
Maybe...

552
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,880
Do you have a date with Dean later?

553
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:18,220
Yes.

554
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,310
He's picking me up later.

555
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,650
It's okay then. I will go
and eat with Manaow. Right?

556
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,690
Yes.

557
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,000

You have to be prepared.

You're going on a date.

560
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,010
You have to look perfect.

561
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,090
Let's do it, Manaow!

562
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,810
Manaow!

563
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,190
Is this a good idea?

564
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,750
Be still.

565
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,310
Trust me. I won't disappoint you.

566
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,340
Mis won't let you down.

567
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,650
It will brighten your face.

568
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,790
