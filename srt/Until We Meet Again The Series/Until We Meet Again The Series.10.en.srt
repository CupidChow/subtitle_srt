1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,989
This song is so nice.

3
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,490
I wish I could stop time.

4
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
Korn.

5
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,490
Korn.

6
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,830
Pharm.

7
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,980
It's okay.

8
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,480
Hello.

9
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,990
[Hello, Dean.]

10
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,990
Who is this?

11
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,330
Pharm.

12
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,490
Is that you?

13
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,210
Del.

14
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,490
What's the matter?

15
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,990
Oh! Nothing.

16
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,410
Dean didn't come back home last night.

17
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,990
But if he's with you 
then I don't have to be worried anymore.

18
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,610
Well,

19
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,990
feel free to do whatever you want.

20
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,490
Hello Del!

21
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,490
Can you tell Dean to please let me know
if he wants to stay another night there?

22
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,990
I won't disturb you anymore.

23
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,210
Del, wait!

24
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,290
Del!

25
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,990
Don!

26
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,490
Dean.

27
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,490
Dean.

28
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,990
Dean!

29
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,490
Dean!

30
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,990
Dean!

31
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,910
Yes?

32
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,980
That's my phone.

33
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,990
Okay.

34
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,990
3 pm.

35
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,490
Okay. I will drop him off.

36
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,490
Take him home for me then.

37
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,190
Dean! Don't look!

38
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,990
Why do you have to close my eyes?

39
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,490
Did you see?

40
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,690
Why are you like this?

41
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,270
Manaow just called. She said 
you guys will study for the exam at 3 pm.

42
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,490
I will drop you off 
and Team will take you home.

43
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,490
I have a car.

44
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,290
But I want to drop you off.

45
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,690
Was Manaow shocked
when you picked up the phone?

46
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,490
She screamed so loud into my ears.

47
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,330
Let me see.

48
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,590
Are your eyes still burning?

49
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,490
Your eyes are still red.

50
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,530
Not anymore.

51
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,990
I had a nice dream this time.

52
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,990
Even though 
I felt a little bit empty inside.

53
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,910
I heard a song too.

54
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,990
It's like a song that my mum
used to play for me.

55
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,990
I think you should take a shower first.

56
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,790
I will shower after you.

57
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,490
Okay.

58
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,480
Let me go then.

59
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,990
Your phone screen wallpaper.

60
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,910
You can change it.

61
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,980
No need to use the picture 
that you secretly took.

62
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,990
Dean.

63
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,990
You didn't go back home last night?

64
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,490
Can I borrow a shirt?

65
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,490
You think you can wear my shirt?

66
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,490
Sorn's shirt.

67
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,290
You have his shirt, don't you?

68
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,990
Here.

69
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,690
Thank you.

70
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,610
Dean.

71
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,990
Have you talked to Pharm yet?

72
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,590
I think I will talk to him today.

73
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,910
If there's anything we can help with, 
you can call us.

74
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,990
We will be here all day.

75
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,790
Of course.

76
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,990
Dean.

77
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,490
Do you want coffee?

78
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,490
Where is it?

79
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,490
I can do it myself.

80
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,490
Over there.

81
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,900
There's palm sugar too.

82
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,990
Mix it with your coffee 
so it will smell better.

83
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,990
I saw lotus flowers.

84
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,790
Are they for paying respect to Buddha?

85
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,490
I will use them to wrap the dessert.

86
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,330
Huh?

87
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,490
Wrap the dessert?

88
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,990
Yes.

89
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,900
Manaow just called me 
and she asked for a dessert.

90
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,030
I went to the market to buy banana leaves
but I couldn't find any.

91
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,510
So, I bought lotus flowers instead.

92
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,990
Stop asking.

93
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,910
The food will get cold.

94
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,990
Today you have to be my assistant 
and help me make the dessert.

95
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,490
We should move in together.

96
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,490
Is this okay?

97
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,330
Thank you.

98
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,690
What are you making?

99
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,990
Ja Mong Kut.

100
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,990
Ja Mong Kut.

101
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,910
Isn't it supposed to be yellowish-orange?

102
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,490
And it looks like a crown.

103
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,900
That is called Dara Thong 
or Thong Ake Grajung.

104
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,890
It was invented during the Phibun era.

105
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,990
But the one I'm making is Ja Mong Kut.

106
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,490
It has been around since King Rama II.

107
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,900
Actually, 
you don't need to use Pandan leaves,

108
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,490
but I like the smell so I put them in too.

109
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,310
My grandmother told me
how this dessert was invented.

110
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,790
But I couldn't remember the details.

111
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,990
I always use the wrong name.

112
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,830
Back then, there was a book that published
the wrong name of this dessert.

113
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,790
It turned out that the book was widely used 
for the original names of Thai desserts.

114
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,550
It's too late to fix it now.

115
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,110
Do you know?

116
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,630
If we bake this with fragrant candle,

117
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,990
the dessert will smell even better.

118
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,110
Del told me that
when you're making desserts,

119
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,890
you are very delicate and focused.

120
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,980
That's right.

121
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,920
Because the charm of Thai desserts 
comes from their beauty

122
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,310
that requires a lot of time to create.

123
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,310
Even if you do it for fun, you still have 
to pay attention to the details.

124
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,440
Do you understand?

125
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,350
About last night...

126
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,990
It's about Intouch.

127
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Dean.

128
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,210
Yes.

129
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,290
Can I ask you something?

130
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
If I know more about Intouch,

131
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,670
will it change our relationship?

132
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,530
It won't.

133
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,830
It will never change.

134
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,990
If...

135
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,230
I listen to what you're going to say,

136
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,110
will I be sad or happy?

137
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,490
I think...

138
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,290
Sad.

139
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,990
If so,

140
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,490
I don't want to know about it yet.

141
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,540
If it makes me sad,

142
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,990
then I think it's better
not to know about it.

143
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,000
Also.

144
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,930
We cannot change what already happened.

145
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,490
Do you know?

146
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,400
I've never used lotus petals
to wrap desserts before.

147
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,990
But there were images 
that came right into my mind.

148
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,490
I think Intouch saw this before.

149
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,980
Apart from feeling sad sometimes,

150
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,710
I think it's okay to let it all go.

151
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,580
That's right.

152
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,410
There's one song whose lyrics 
I really like.

153
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,390
"If the past memories come back to me"

154
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,490
"I will choose to remember 
only the good ones"

155
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,690
"So there will only be 
the beauty of tomorrow."

156
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,480
It's the old song 
that my mum used to play.

157
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,490
It has a really good meaning.

158
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,490
Why are you frowning?

159
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,290
I give up.

160
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,990
Give up?

161
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,990
I surrender to you.

162
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,990
I've totally fallen for you.

163
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,490
Can I kiss you?

164
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,990
I'll kiss you now.

165
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,330
Dean.

166
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,500
Dean.

167
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,990
Dean.

168
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,490
Pharm.

169
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,130
I'm sorry.

170
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,990
Open your mouth.

171
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,490
Come on.

172
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,190
Does it taste good?

173
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,490
Don't do something like that again, okay?

174
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,990
Okay.

175
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,550
I will never do something like that again.

176
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Team.

177
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,590
This morning I called Pharm.

178
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,540
And?

179
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,490
What?

180
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,490
What happened to Pharm?

181
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,490
What happened to Pharm?

182
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,480
Listen to me carefully.

183
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,830
Dean picked up the phone!

184
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,490
I'm sure now.

185
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,990
Finally.

186
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,290
What's wrong with you?
You should be happy for him.

187
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,990
Your mouth is so smelly.

188
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,990
I'm sorry.

189
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,290
About Pharm... I'm sure!

190
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,490
Are you okay?

191
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,590
Is it Pharm?

192
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,990
Sure. Open the door. We have to ask him.

193
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,830
I need to calm down.

194
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,410
Come here.

195
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,900
Come.

196
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,990
Come here.

197
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,030
Quick.

198
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,290
What?

199
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,290
Confess to me now.

200
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,990
Confess about what?

201
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,330
About the reason why
Dean answered the phone.

202
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,690
It was early in the morning.

203
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,490
Don't tell me that he didn't sleep over.

204
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,990
Isn't that normal?

205
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,820
Manaow.

206
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,690
Normal...

207
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,210
It would be normal 
if you were not his boyfriend.

208
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,130
But you guys are...

209
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,400
What?

210
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,490
Manaow.

211
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,990
Holy shit!

212
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,490
What?

213
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,990
Don't tell me...

214
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,490
He "ate" you already.

215
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,410
Ate me?

216
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,990
I'm sure he did.

217
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,400
Let me check.

218
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,410
Stop it.

219
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,330
Let me check.

220
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,990
I won't let you eat the dessert now.

221
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,900
Come on.

222
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,410
Give it to me.

223
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,400
You've already eaten, let me have it too.

224
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,210
I haven't.

225
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,130
You have!

226
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,330
I can see it.

227
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,610
You guys...

228
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,490
I will find out the truth. 
I will put a camera into your room.

229
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,690
Put a camera in my room?

230
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,820
What is it?

231
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,900
What are you doing?

232
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,990
Reading a novel. Stop it.

233
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,990
What novel?

234
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,980
I'm not telling you.

235
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,990
Hi Dean.

236
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,990
Why didn't you tell us that you were going
to sleep over at Pharm's room?

237
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,210
I'm sorry.

238
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,990
It was very late.

239
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,410
Here's the dessert.

240
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,490
Thank you.

241
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,990
What is this pink wrapping thing?
It's so cute.

242
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,490
Pharm said they are lotus petals.

243
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,990
What is this dessert? 
I've never seen it before.

244
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,490
Ja Mong Kut.

245
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,490
Isn't it supposed to be yellowish-orange?

246
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,990
You should ask Pharm for the details.

247
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,990
Don, look.

248
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,710
We can eat the whole thing?

249
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,790
Of course not. You have to open it first.

250
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,490
It's so cute.

251
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,690
When are our parents coming back?

252
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,910
Around the end of the year 
or maybe for New Year.

253
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,490
They are looking for tickets.

254
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,990
But...

255
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,980
I don't think they can make it
before your swimming competition.

256
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,490
You two.

257
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,490
Have you guys ever met 
our maternal grandmother?

258
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,410
You...

259
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,990
Don't you hate our grandma?

260
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,400
What are you talking about?

261
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,190
Who said I hate her?

262
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,180
Well, Dad said

263
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,540
his mother didn't like our mum.

264
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,770
She hated our mum's side of the family.

265
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,490
So, we thought...

266
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,990
I wasn't taught to hate people.

267
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
So.

268
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,350
Have you ever met her?

269
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,690
We visit her quite often
but we didn't tell you.

270
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,910
We...

271
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,990
We're scared that you would be angry.

272
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,880
But our grandmother always asks about you.

273
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,490
I show her many pictures of you.

274
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,490
I want to meet her.

275
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,490
I want to meet our grandmother.

276
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,490
I hope it can be today.

277
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,990
Can you take me to meet her?

278
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,030
Then.

279
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,990
Wait a second.

280
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,490
Hello.

281
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,900
Yes.

282
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,490
Are you at home?

283
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,340
Oh, you're home.

284
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,240
We are going to visit you today.

285
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,910
Okay.

286
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,990
Got it.

287
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,270
See you later.

288
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,130
She's at home.

289
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,990
Her house is not far from here.

290
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,790
So.

291
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,870
Should we go today?

292
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,050
What's wrong with you?

293
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,890
Read the text. That's how you read it.

294
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,500
Make sure you read it correctly.

295
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,570
[Dean: I gotta go.]
[Pharm: Are you okay?]

296
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,680
[Dean: I gotta go]
[Pharm: ...]

297
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,090
[I've come to study at Team's place.]

298
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,260
What are you doing?

299
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,000
You guys are not even two hours apart yet.

300
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,450
You're texting him already?

301
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,070
I just feel worried.

302
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,860
Are you sure there's nothing wrong?

303
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,210
Nothing.

304
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,110
I'm just overthinking.

305
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,470
Manaow.

306
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,770
Can I borrow your pencil?

307
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,140
Here

308
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,830
I'm using it.

309
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,590
Find another one in my bag.

310
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,940
Why do you have so many?

311
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,890
You said you're going 
to borrow a pencil...

312
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,930
You're asking me why?

313
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,290
Come nearer.

314
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,230
None of your business!

315
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,750
You're so nosy. You know?

316
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,190
Come here.

317
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,940
Why?

318
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,250
Nothing.

319
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,590
You like it?

320
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:18,730
No.

321
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,430
The colour is so nice.

322
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,610
Your lips are very dry.

323
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,880
Stay still.

324
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,810
Trust me. It's just lip balm.

325
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,650
I think it's unfair to Team.

326
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:02,690
I need to go to the toilet.

327
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,810
Come here.

328
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,610
Manaow!

329
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,630
I don't think it's a good idea.

330
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,070
It is!

331
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,800
It's very good.

332
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,910
That's why I have so many 
of these lipsticks.

333
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,930
You can apply it on cheeks too?

334
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,120
Of course, you can.

335
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,640
I apply it on my cheek and my eyes.

336
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,370
Manaow, you should try.

337
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,570
You can apply it on eyes but teeth...

338
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,400
Can you apply it on your teeth?

339
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,930
Teeth?

340
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,340
Who'd apply it on their teeth? 
Are you crazy?

341
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,400
Do you think it's possible?

342
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,470
You only apply it on eyes and cheeks.

343
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,450
We should try.

344
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,230
Fine. We can try.

345
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,060
I see many girls who like to apply it
on their teeth too.

346
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,990
Let me see.

347
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,530
I think this is wasting...

348
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,070
Guys, I'm sorry for what I've done...

349
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,060
I think we should study now.

350
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,690
No. Let me paint your teeth first.

351
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,500
You can just drop me off here.

352
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,370
Are you sure?

353
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,920
Do you want me to meet your parents?

354
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,830
It's okay.

355
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,630
I'll see you later then.

356
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,070
Get home safely.

357
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,240
Hello, An.

358
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,420
Hello.

359
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,290
How are you?

360
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,000
Did you wait long?

361
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,770
I've missed you so much.

362
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,640
She keeps saying that she misses you.

363
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,700
What did your mum cook for you?

364
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,940
Papaya salad.

365
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,290
Papaya salad. Did you have fun? 
What else did you do today?

366
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,710
We're here.

367
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,970
Grandma.

368
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,500
Why do you come to see me so suddenly?

369
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,460
I was missing you so much.

370
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,170
You're so sweet.

371
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,470
Hello, grandma.

372
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,430
Hello.

373
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,630
You have a special guest today.

374
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,850
Dean.

375
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,170
Is that you?

376
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,690
Dean.

377
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,500
You've finally come to see me?

378
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,200
Dean.

379
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,210
I've missed you so much.

380
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,790
You've finally come to see me.

381
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,550
You've grown up already.

382
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,070
I missed you.

383
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,239
Do you know

384
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,710
that I miss you?

385
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,630
I'm so sorry.

386
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,429
I'm sorry that I never came to see you.

387
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,090
It's okay.

388
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,770
I understand.

389
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,570
I'm not mad at you at all.

390
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,980
I miss you every day.

391
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,989
Dean.

392
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,850
I have so many things to tell you.

393
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,659
I also have so many things 
that I want to talk to you about.

394
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,630
I missed you.

395
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,810
My grandson.

396
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,030
We will find something to eat first then.

397
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,590
An.

398
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,640
You can actually use these lotus petals
to do so many things.

399
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,470
A few days ago, when you made the dessert,

400
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,690
you used lotus petals to wrap it.

401
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,150
The smell was so nice.

402
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,510
There are many benefits.

403
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,880
Lotus petals can be used to make salad.

404
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,470
Miang Kham too.

405
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,940
Or we can use them to wrap desserts 
to make them smell better.

406
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,410
Why does it taste so bad?

407
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,670
A good medicine tastes bitter.

408
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,330
But no one eats just a petal alone.

409
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,790
That's why I use these petals
to make salad.

410
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,110
Look.

411
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,610
You should use them to wrap desserts

412
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,170
I like it.

413
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,980
Okay.

414
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,460
Next time then.

415
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,300
Okay.

416
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,750
Thank you.

417
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,010
Let me help you.

418
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,850
Sure.

419
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,740
Or do you want to eat another petal?

420
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,220
No way.

421
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,570
Come on

422
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,830
I will eat the salad.

423
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,990
You can help me do this.

424
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,610
Put this one.

425
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,450
You can cut this.

426
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,820
Are you sure you want me to do this?

427
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,450
I'm not sure now.

428
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,550
I'm quite worried.

429
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,010
Try this first.

430
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,320
Let's see

431
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,540
if you like it or not.

432
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,810
Try it.

433
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,160
I think we need to put more lime juice.

434
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,430
More?

435
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,990
A lot more.

436
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,970
Let's do this together.

437
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,390
I'm craving right now!

438
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,190
I guarantee you.

439
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,970
It will be delicious!

440
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,970
I understand

441
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,190
that your father's side of the family
doesn't like your mum.

442
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,590
Your mum was precocious.

443
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,090
She got pregnant before she even finished
high school.

444
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,950
Your great-grandfather was so angry.

445
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:31,110
He almost called the police 
to arrest your father.

446
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,990
In the end,

447
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,140
for the sake of his great-grandson,

448
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,710
he let your parents get married.

449
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,340
I'm so glad that your grandmother 
loved you so much.

450
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,830
She might be strict.

451
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:53,970
But she loved her grandchildren 
very much. You don't have to worry.

452
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,670
What's that?

453
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,310
Dessert.

454
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,950
This...

455
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,810
This is Ja Mongkut.

456
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,750
I haven't seen this dessert for so long.

457
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,570
There're not many people
using lotus petals to wrap it.

458
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,750
It's very rare.

459
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,530
When I was young,
I loved to make desserts too.

460
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,350
I used lotus petals for wrapping too.

461
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,710
Someone I know liked it.

462
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,390
Where did you buy it?

463
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,550
The person who made this
must be very skillful.

464
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,300
The smell

465
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,170
is very nice.

466
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,550
My lover made it.

467
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,230
You have a girlfriend already?

468
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,410
She is very skillful.

469
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,790
It's so rare to find young people 
who can make Thai desserts.

470
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,350
Next time bring her along too.

471
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,140
Grandma.

472
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,390
Yes?

473
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,450
My lover

474
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,410
is a man.

475
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,520
[Intouch Chatphokin]

476
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,520
[Born: August 30, 1969]

477
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,590
[Died: August 30, 1988]

478
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,670
Dean.

479
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,370
What did you just say?

480
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,290
What do you mean?

481
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,210
He is a man.

482
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,610
No matter what happens.

483
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,110
Don't hurt yourself.

484
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,610
Please don't.

485
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,710
I'm begging you.

486
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,590
Please.

487
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,450
Please.

488
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,810
You don't have to worry.

489
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,970
Trust me.

490
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,690
I will not commit suicide.

491
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,470
I'm sorry.

492
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,810
I don't understand.

493
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,350
I couldn't protect him.

494
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,410
No one will die this time.

495
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,130
Even if my dad is against it.

496
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,190
It will not be the same as before.

497
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,790
Dean...

498
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,530
You're saying...

499
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,870
You're saying...

500
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,470
I'm sorry

501
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,820
that I couldn't protect him.

502
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,010
I'm sorry.

503
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,250
That I was the cause of Intouch's death.

504
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,170
I'm sorry.

505
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,950
That I caused you 
to lose your beloved brother.

506
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,970
Why are you saying sorry?

507
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,170
It was his own decision.

508
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,120
It wasn't.

509
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,230
It wasn't Korn's fault.

510
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,190
An.

511
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,130
No.

512
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,610
Korn.

513
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,890
He's in here.

514
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,630
He lives in me.

515
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,150
He wanted to tell you.

516
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,070
"I'm sorry".

517
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,170
Grandma!

518
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,090
Someone!

519
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,590
Help.

520
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,470
Don't.

521
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,410
Are you tired?

522
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,990
Are you in pain?

523
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,450
Are you hurt?

524
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,290
You trust me?

525
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,810
My grandson.

526
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,950
My grandson never lies.

527
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,930
I'm sorry.

528
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,470
I'm really sorry.

529
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,330
Dean.

530
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,710
You're saying that...

531
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:22,990
You have Korn's memories?

532
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,980
Yes.

533
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,860
Most of my memories

534
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,490
are about Intouch and family.

535
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,980
Apart from that,

536
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,390
I can barely remember anything.

537
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,770
How about In?

538
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,390
Intouch couldn't cook that well.

539
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,940
But he never forgets your cooking skill.

540
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,180
Thank you.

541
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,510
Thank you so much.

542
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:13,390
Thank you for loving him.

543
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,690
Thank you for finding him.

544
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,430
Thank you so much.

545
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,310
Welcome...

546
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,410
Welcome back.

547
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,490
Yes.

548
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,510
Yes, Grandma.

549
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,550
I missed you.

550
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,130
I missed you so much.

551
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,950
I'm back.

552
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,240
Don't ever leave me again.

553
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,810
Please.

554
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,050
I promise.

555
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,170
I promise you.

556
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,150
I will not go anywhere.

557
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,010
[Pharm: I'm home.]

558
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,120
I'm home.

559
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,870
[Pharm: I think I studied too much. 
My brain is gone.]

560
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,280
[I think I studied too much. 
My brain is gone.]

561
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:40,550
[Dean: Keep fighting. 
I have rewards for you after the exam.]

562
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,290
[Keep fighting. 
I have rewards for you after the exam.]

563
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,320
What are you doing here?

564
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,370
Can I sleep with you tonight?

565
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,780
Move.

566
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,270
Move.

567
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,490
How am I supposed to sleep?

568
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,250
You're not going to move, right?

569
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,930
What are you doing?

570
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,930
You're not moving.

571
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,690
What the hell are you doing?

572
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,890
I was just joking around.

573
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,370
You cannot sleep again?

574
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,250
Yeah.

575
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,720
You can just tell me next time.

576
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,830
Okay.

577
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:11,930
Win.

578
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,930
I almost forgot.

579
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,840
Merry Christmas.

580
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,100
Why are you saying it now?

581
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,560
Can you take me to see the lights?

582
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,770
Tell me when you're free.

583
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,380
I'll take you there.

584
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,900
Win.

585
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,610
Can I hug you?

586
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,980
I cannot sleep.

587
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:15,980
[Side Story]

588
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,330
He will be handsome when he wakes up.

589
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,160
Very handsome.

590
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,300
New eyebrows.

591
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,580
Nose too.

592
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,320
A little bit on the nose bridge.

593
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,280
Why does it seem easy to use?

594
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,110
Because this is MYSS.

595
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,050
Easy to use. Long-lasting. Time-saving.

596
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,900
It's hard for me to wake up early
in the morning.

597
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,780
So, I have this makeup to save my life.

598
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,230
He has eyebrows now.

599
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,120
His nose is highlighted.

600
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,220
I think we're missing something.

601
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,040
You're right.

602
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,230
Anyone who sees him will be surprised.

603
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:20,370
[Next Episode]

604
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,860
I will take you
to see the Christmas lights.

605
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,950
These are my clothes.

606
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:20,430
How did you get them?

607
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,860
It doesn't matter where we're going.

608
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,800
What matters is

609
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,500
who you're going with.
