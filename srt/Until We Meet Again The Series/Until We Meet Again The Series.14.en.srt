00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,170
The moral lesson of this story is

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,620
a person who is unkind and untrustworthy

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,590
will face bad consequences.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,070
That's it.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,590
Uncle In,

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,870
why is my daddy’s surname
not the same as mine and my mum’s?

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,920
Because I love you so much

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,170
I want you to use the same surname as me.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,350
I love you so much too.

11

You’re so sweet.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,250
Even if your surname is different,

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,410
your dad still loves you dearly.

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,450
I love him so much too.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,850
When I grow up, I will marry you.

16

You cannot marry him.

Why not?

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,850
I love uncle In.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,930
I already have someone that I love.

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,010
I’m so sorry.

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,050
Are you going to marry that person?

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,470
I wish that I could.

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,470
Uncle In, you have to keep smiling.

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,090
I’m casting a spell on you already.

26

It’s okay.

36
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,870
Take a deep breath.

37
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,600
Look at me.

38
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,630
Just now,

39
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,730
you seemed like you couldn’t breathe.

40
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,810
You suddenly fainted.

41
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,380
I took you to rest here.

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,620
How do you feel now?

Do you feel like you cannot breathe?

How can you go back like this?

51
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,610

When you fainted,

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,330
Dean carried you right away.

57
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,480
I asked him who you were.

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,570
He told me you are his boyfriend.

59
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,600
I was quite shocked.

00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,690
I’m in charge of quality control.

178
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,270
You can eat it later.

179
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,190
I’m checking if it’s yummy or not.

180
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,970
You cook very well.

181
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:49,940
Don.

182
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,030
Put it down!

183
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,150
I'm your quality control inspector.

184
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,400
Put it down!

185
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,920
I won't.

186
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,930
Don.

187
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,040
Stop eating.

188
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,840
You will spill it.

189
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,720
You’re bugging us.

190
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,890
Put it down.

191
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,460
You’re in the way.

192
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,520
I'm also finished. Just let me eat.

193
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,230
No! Just get out of here.

194
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,980
Okay.

195
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,040
This one is for Don.

196
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,250
Okay.

197
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,470
My parents are not scary.

198
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,980
Mum.

199
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,070
How long are you staying this time?

200
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,570
Three days.

201
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,400
Only three days again.

202
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,090
When will you stay for months?

203
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,280
My work will be done soon.

204
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,650
Have you been studying hard?

205
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,730
Breakfast is here.

206
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,190
My goodness!

207
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,270
How can we let our guest serve us?

208
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,610
It’s okay. I can help.

209
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,890
Eat it while it’s still hot.

210
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,290
Let’s talk later.

211
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,010
Dad,

212
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,250
I made the porridge today.

213
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,870
Since when did you learn how to cook?

214
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,770
You know nothing.

215
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,850
I can cook many things now.

216
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,570
Liar.

217
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,430
Don!

218
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,980
I saw this morning.
Someone was helping you.

219
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,870
We were cooking together.
It’s the same thing.

220
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,270
Del told me you are good at cooking.

221
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,330
This is very delicious.

222
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,350
I’m not that good.

223
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,330
Come on.

224
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,030
Start eating.

225
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,390
Sit down.

226
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,890
If you have anything to say,

227
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,090
say it in front of the whole family.

228
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,240
I think mum probably told you already.

229
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,900
This is Pharm.

230
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,480
He’s the one I love.

231
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,400
Have you thought about this carefully?

232
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,180
I’ve thought this through.

233
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,400
What did your parents say?

234
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,760
My dad passed away already.

235
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,180
My mum knows about our relationship.

236
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,960
She’s okay with it.

237
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,590
You two will face a lot of obstacles
from now on. You know this, right?

238
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,640
Are you sure that both of you
can handle it?

239
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,170
-Yes.
-Yes.

240
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,100
My dear.

241
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,659
I didn’t know he could be soft-spoken.

242
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,440
Dear.

243
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,270
Don’t whine about this later then.

244
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,790
What are you guys staring at?

245
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,920
Our son brought his lover
to sleep over tonight.

246
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,400
Lover?

247
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,590
Sleep over?

248
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,640
How can you let him do that?

249
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,330
It’s not a big deal.

250
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,570
You have to trust your son.

251
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,700
It’s not about our son.

252
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,320
It’s about the girl.

253
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,070
It’s not good for her
if people find out about this.

254
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,830
His lover is a boy.

255
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,050
You're not against
his relationship, right?

256
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,050
Why would I do that to my son?

257
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,670
Our parents were against us before.

258
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,430
We weren’t ready back then.

259
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,210
I didn’t even finish my high school.

260
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,510
I heard my mum called you yesterday.

261
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,980
What did you two talk about?

262
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,380
Your mum told me to be
open-minded and talk to our son.

263
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,810
If Dean won’t bring it up,
I should be the one to talk to him first.

264
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,840
Or

265
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,400
if he talks to me,

266
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,330
I should listen to what he says.

267
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,500
You both are so stubborn.

268
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,710
Like father, like son.

269
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,040
You know this is how I am.

270
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,710
We still have to learn
how to become good parents.

271
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,540
We have to keep doing our best.

272
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,960
I will bring this outside then.

273
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,090
Okay.

274
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,480
Also, I almost forgot.

275
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,910
I’m happy for both of you.

276
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,480
Your dad is cute.

277
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,710
How can you think he’s cute?

278
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,040
He’s cute because he is like you.

279
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,360
Do you want to try this?

280
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,150
It’s so yummy.

281
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,220
I don’t know...

282
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,080
if it’s because of the dessert
or because of you.

283
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,480
Right.

284
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,120
Next week.

285
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,760
My mum texted me this morning.

286
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,310
She said that my cousin will pick me
up to meet my uncle.

287
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,410
I might get a chance
to meet my grandpa too.

288
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,080
Well…

289
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,840
Do you want me to go with you?

290
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,340
It’s okay.

291
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,830
Next Friday is a holiday.

292
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,030
Can I sleep over at your place?

293
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,250
Of course.

294
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,650
This time,

295
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,570
it won’t be just a sleepover.

296

I will not wait any longer.

Yes.

312
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,090
I wanted a new car.

313
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,470
I decided to change the colour too.

314
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,240
Why did you choose red?

315
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,380
I think it looks nice.
