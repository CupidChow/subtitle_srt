Rey

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
What's the matter with you?

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,800
Ow!

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,320
Why so frightened?

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,280
My arms are gonna bruise!

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,880
Ow, be gentle...

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,040
So, earlier...

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
What was the sweet dream about?

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,880
I noticed you smiling for quite a while.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
What are you talking about?
That's baloney!

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It was a nightmare!

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,840
Since coming home from Chanthaburi...

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
you've been acting weird.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Or is there anything
you haven't told me?

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
Nope!

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,600
I...

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm completely fine.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
"Fine."

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,480
Hm...

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,040
Or is it...

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,440
Is it...

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,800
that you miss...

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,400
home!

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
You're homesick, aren't you?

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,600
Yeah!

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,320
I am homesick.

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm off to take a shower!

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Hold on!

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,040
Hurry up with the shower,

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,920
so we can rehearse the script.

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,920
Alright,

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,000
this is the scene where you realize
your feelings have changed,

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,080
so you confess your love.

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,840
I'll be your partner.

42
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,720
For the confession scene?

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,320
Mm.

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,600
With you?

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,440
Mm.

46
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Why?

47
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,360
Don't tell me...

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,360
you've never confessed your love
to anyone.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,560
Mm!

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,440
It's actually true.

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm the one
people confessed their love to.

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Alright, alright.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,080
Though you haven't done so,

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
you must've had feelings for someone,

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,360
mustn't you?

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,560
Try imagining your crush's face

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
for this scene.

58
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,160
My crush's face...

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,960
I'm not exactly sure
what happened between us

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,280
or when my feelings for you

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,560
started to change.

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
Should there be anything on your mind,

63
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,360
just say it frankly.

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
I...

65
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,240
love you.

66
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Wow, that was quite a performance!

67
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,320
Yay me!

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,440
Yay.

69
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,240
Just got a compliment from The Rey.

70
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
So...

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,440
whose face did you think of

72
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,800
that got you so into the scene?

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,080
No one! I...

74
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,040
was just tired of you whining,

75
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,360
so I got it done in one go.

76
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Is that so?

77
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
With that much fluster...

78
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,120
I'd say you're having
a crush on someone.

79
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,200
Are you?

80
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
You're just yapping.

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,400
What the hell is wrong with you, Print?!

82
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,160
Is your crush...

83
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
on the set with us?

84
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
And why do I have to tell you?

85
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,280
Well,

86
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,800
maybe I can help you with that.

87
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,320
I can befriend them in your body.

88
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Not telling ya.

89
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,360
You're not telling me...

90
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,360
Then, that would mean...

91
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,000
they're here.

92
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,680
I can understand that

93
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,680
since this industry
is filled with good-looking people.

94
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,080
If you developed feelings for someone
after working together,

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,440
it wouldn't be surprising,

96
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
would it?

97
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,200
You have fallen for someone
you worked with?

98
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,800
No,

99
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm professional enough.

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,000
If you won't tell,
it's up to you.

101
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,280
I'm not particularly interested
in your business.

102
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
Whoa,

103
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
that's what you called "not interested"?

104
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,680
Rey, are you free?
I have something to talk to you about.

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,120
This industry
is filled with good-looking people.

106
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,840
If you developed feelings for someone
after working together,

107
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
it wouldn't be surprising.

108
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,800
Fon.

109
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,800
Huh?

110
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,800
If you put down someone's name
in the contact with an emoji,

111
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,880
does that mean they're special to you?

112
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,680
Uh... I guess so.

113
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,400
But for someone...

114
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,520
that might have only been true
in the past.

115
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
For example,

116
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,760
it was just there for so long
that you forgot to change it.

117
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
Why are you asking?

118
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,920
Just because.

119
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,280
No matter what,

120
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,360
I want you to know

121
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
you're the only one
I want to spend my life with.

122
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,800
But it's impossible for us
to be together, Mr. Prachak.

123
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,240
- You're now betrothed to Miss Rin.
- Do you think...

124
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
everyone will like the first episode?

125
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
Why are you zoning out?

126
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,080
You made it as the female lead;

127
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,160
don't you wanna see your work?

128
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,080
Turn your hair soft and silky

129
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,440
with Dyfun.

130
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,960
Dyfun,

131
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200
a blow dryer from your dream.

132
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,240
Are you and Auer close?

133
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,760
Well...

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560
We've known each other
since we started in the industry.

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Why do you ask?

136
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,760
I'll go take a shower.

137
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,160
I'll catch up on the rerun.

138
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,000
Auer and Rey are just the thing!

139
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,120
Auer and Rey's chemistry
is through the roof!

140
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,360
Don't you dare get closer to Auer.

141
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
What a pain in the butt!

142
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,360
She's obviously throwing herself at him.

143
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,960
She's so desperate
to pair up with him.

144
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,120
Rey's such a pick-me.

145
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,120
It's like she couldn't
get enough of her fame.

146
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,320
Auer's fandom is high-key scary!

147
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,520
You want me to film a vlog with Auer?!

148
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,440
The first episode aired
created a strong sensation for AuerRey,

149
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,720
so the client wants you
to film a vlog every week from now on.

150
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
But...

151
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,960
I'll take care of it, Mai.

152
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,640
Hey, guys!

153
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,880
You're with us in
"AuerRey Touring the Set."

154
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,320
We're now approaching the last scenes,
aren't we, Rey?

155
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes.

156
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,680
I wonder if someone here will miss me
after we finish filming...

157
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,880
Someone here?

158
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Don't think so.

159
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,200
Try your luck over there.

160
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,320
Rey probably means everyone on set

161
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,240
since we'll definitely be missing
The Doll Mansion crew so badly.

162
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,160
You don't seem like that
with other people.

163
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,600
What exactly is going on?

164
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Why are you here?

165
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,560
What...are you doing?

166
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,920
Just hold still.

167
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,920
Right,

168
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,640
how was the vlog with Auer?

169
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Why?

170
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,160
Do you want to film it with him instead?

171
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm sorry that it seems like
I'm stealing your thunder

172
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,640
just because I'm in your body.

173
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,920
If you want to be in the vlog
or talk to Auer,

174
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,920
why don't we
find a way to switch back now?

175
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
If that's all you came here for,

176
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,640
can you please leave?

177
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm preparing for the next scene,

178
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,360
so I need to be focused.

179
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,040
Print, why were you
so sarcastic to her?!

180
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
That was pretty obvious...

181
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,720
You like Auer, don't you?

182
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,000
This is the scene where Auer
is torn between choosing the two girls;

183
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,480
meanwhile, both Rey and Print
will beg Auer

184
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,800
for his love.

185
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,440
Okay, that's about it.

186
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,160
- Alright, we're ready.
- Let's go.

187
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Be on standby...

188
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
Ready...

189
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,760
Camera rolling...

190
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,640
and action!

191
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,240
Didn't you say I was the only woman

192
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
you wished to spend your life with?

193
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,800
Does your heart still hold true,
Mr. Prachak?

194
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
I can't answer that.

195
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm dearly sorry.

196
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,920
Please just speak the truth,

197
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,280
and stop showering me with false hope.

198
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,880
Mr. Prachak...

199
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,200
what would you decide?

200
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,840
Please answer me!

201
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Mr. Prachak!

202
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,960
Mr. Prachak,

203
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,560
I could never understand
why you're so fickle.

204
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,800
If you want to love,
you need to make yourself clear at once

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,200
instead of making two women
wait for you to decide!

206
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,360
This is not what gentlemen do.

207
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,240
Cut!

208
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,600
Print, go wait for the next scene.

209
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,120
Yes, sir.

210
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,680
Pong, I'm truly sorry.

211
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,600
What were you thinking?

212
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,920
I freaking love that!

213
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,960
I'll take it!

214
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,360
It's such a woke move.

215
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,360
So woke.

216
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,920
That's just...
a wonderful job.

217
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,800
Guys, give her a round of applause!

218
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,920
Let's move the set!

219
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,560
Top-notch!

220
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,040
Rey,

221
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
can I talk to you for a sec?

222
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,440
About how I went off the script?

223
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,280
- I'm really sorry...
- No, not about that.

224
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I...

225
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
I wanna ask you out for a meal.

226
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,680
Do you have any time to spare?

227
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,960
My schedule is pretty packed right now.

228
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
Um...

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,640
I really have something
important to tell you.

230
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,280
Tell me when you have time, please?

231
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,400
Okay?

232
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,880
Fon!

233
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,520
What?

234
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,760
What does it mean when a guy

235
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
invites a girl to a meal?

236
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,880
Why do you ask?

237
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,320
Is somebody asking you on a date?

238
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,080
No! It's just research

239
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,800
for a scene

240
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,680
where a guy invites my character out
for a meal.

241
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,120
Hm... Actually...

242
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
It could mean one of the two things...

243
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
Maybe he really wants
to take you on a date,

244
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,480
or maybe it's genuinely a platonic meal

245
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,040
to discuss something.

246
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,760
This is just a what-if.

247
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,360
Ah...

248
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,560
- Let's say that A is a friend of B...
- Mm.

249
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,720
yet A is possessive of B.

250
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,400
Is A in the wrong?

251
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
But you don't feel "possessive"
toward a friend.

252
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Alright, alright.

253
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,960
Well, it's not entirely wrong...

254
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,360
It's just two people
feeling something different.

255
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,840
One thinks of another
more than friends,

256
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,840
while the other
thinks of them as a friend.

257
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,560
But who could help it?

258
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Feelings are impossible to control.

259
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,160
What if...

260
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,640
Alright. "What if."

261
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,680
What if B was asked out,

262
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,160
- but A didn't want them to go,
- Hm.

263
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,720
would it be wrong?

264
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,080
Would that be wrong?

265
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Hm...

266
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,960
I guess it's up to B
if they wanted to go.

267
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,080
If B did,

268
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,720
A wouldn't be able
to say anything, right?

269
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
I think you'd better...

270
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,560
A!

271
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,960
I think A'd better be honest with B

272
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,320
and talk things out.

273
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,520
Alright!

274
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,520
I'll pass the message to A.

275
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,520
It was just a what-if...

276
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,440
- Right...
- Just a what-if...

277
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,640
I'll blow-dry your hair.

278
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,840
What if my body got sick
because you let it air dry?

279
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,680
Mm...

280
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Sit right there.

281
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,920
My body is too tall,

282
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,120
while yours is short...

283
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,200
Could you sit there instead?

284
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
In the Jacuzzi.

285
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
Mm.

286
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
How bossy!

287
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Dyfun,

288
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,000
a blow dryer from your dream.

289
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,560
I have something to ask you.

290
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,160
I have something to ask you!

291
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,440
Huh? What was that?

292
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,600
I have something to ask you!

293
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
I do, too!

294
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,880
- Are you in love with Auer?
- Are you in love with Auer?

295
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,440
- I'm not!
- Are you outta your mind?!

296
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,640
Why would you think
I'm in love with him?

297
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,920
Well...

298
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,200
You guys seem close,

299
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
and you even saved
his contact name with an emoji.

300
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,200
Saving someone's contact name
with an emoji

301
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,440
should mean something special?

302
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
And...

303
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,240
why do you think I'm into him?

304
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,640
It seems like
you're having a crush on someone,

305
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,520
and Auer is the only one
you're particularly close to right now.

306
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Nuh-uh!

307
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,440
I never even want to be!

308
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,440
That guy's the one trying to get close.

309
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Auer and I are friends;

310
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,840
there's no way
we could be something else.

311
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
What if...

312
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,080
Auer asked you to be his girlfriend?

313
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,280
I would reject him.

314
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
What?

315
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,000
What about my hair?

316
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,880
I'm sleepy!

317
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,440
[Auer]

318
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
About your invite...

319
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
how about lunch tomorrow?

320
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,960
I have your favorite dish
ordered right here.

321
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,680
Lemme help you with some.

322
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Don't bother.

323
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
I'll do it myself.

324
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,400
If there's something you want to say,

325
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,080
just shoot it straight.

326
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,400
I have somewhere to be next.

327
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
Do you think this is pretty?

328
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,000
I think I'll give this to someone,

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,480
but I'm not sure if they will like it.

330
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,480
I spent a lot of time choosing

331
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,120
and guessing what they like.

332
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
- Maybe they'd...
- Auer,

333
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm sorry,

334
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,760
but I only think of you as a friend.

335
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,440
Do you think
I think of you more than friends?

336
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
Well, you...

337
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,280
You asked me out for a meal
and showed me that necklace,

338
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
so I thought... this was a date.

339
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,960
Don't tell me...

340
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,360
you thought I liked you, Rey?

341
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,320
The reason I asked you to join me today

342
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
is that I really wanna ask
for your advice.

343
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
Here's what happened...

344
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,560
I'm seeing someone

345
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,560
who's not in the industry.

346
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
I'm thinking about
committing to the relationship.

347
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,040
Who is that person?

348
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,880
And how did you two meet?

349
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,760
He's my junior from college

350
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,080
who is now working on our set.

351
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
For real?!

352
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,160
Being on the same set,

353
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,760
I invited him to stay over at my place

354
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,760
to make it easier to travel to work,

355
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,360
when, in fact,

356
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,840
I just want some time alone with him.

357
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
At first,

358
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,760
he wasn't gonna come live with me

359
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,480
because he was worried about

360
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,720
his older sister living alone.

361
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,240
But, ultimately,

362
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,560
it turned out his sister
went to live with a friend,

363
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,160
so he agreed.

364
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,280
Wait...

365
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,480
What position is
the person you're seeing

366
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,920
responsible for on the set?

367
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
He's in the art team.

368
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't tell me it's Frank?!

369
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,280
Please take off your masks.

370
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,400
I've been so busy
with the internship.

371
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,560
Can I go live with my friend
for a while?

372
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
It's easier to go to work from there.

373
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
This is for me?

374
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Yes!!

375
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,080
Oh, so you can tell?

376
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm thinking about asking Frank
to be my boyfriend with this bracelet.

377
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,240
At first, I was gonna get us
matching rings,

378
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,440
but since I'm an actor,

379
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
the paparazzi could catch on to that.

380
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,960
So, bracelet it is.

381
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,840
Isn't it nice?

382
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
"Nice" my ass!

383
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,600
What...

384
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,840
Does Frank not like bracelets
or something?

385
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,080
It's not like that...

386
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,560
Be for real with me,

387
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,800
do you really love Frank?

388
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,920
Have you really thought this through?

389
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,400
You're an actor;

390
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,840
what do you have planned for the future?

391
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,120
Are you gonna keep it a secret forever?!

392
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,840
Huh?!

393
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,880
You...

394
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,840
You talk like you're Frank's sister...

395
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,520
Just think it over, Auer!

396
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,920
Rey!

397
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
I know now Auer doesn't like you

398
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,760
or me!

399
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,400
And who's he into?

400
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,680
Frank!

401
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
Auer is in a talking stage with Frank!

402
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,960
And he's gonna ask Frank
to be his boyfriend!

403
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
I'd love to see Auer in a relationship.

404
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
He must be falling head over heels!

405
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
Hey, hey!

406
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
The door's jammed,
so just leave it like that.

407
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,240
If it's closed, it won't open
from the inside.

408
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
- Thanks!
- That was close.

409
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,080
- Boo!
- Gosh!

410
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,520
You scared me!

411
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,880
Stop playing!

412
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,920
The doll could break, you know?

413
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,600
Are you free tonight?

414
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,680
Let's have dinner together.

415
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
What's the occasion?

416
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,040
I'll just shoot it straight.

417
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,360
Are you asking Frank
to be your boyfriend today?

418
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,240
Thanks to you asking that day,

419
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,720
I went home and pondered

420
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
before deciding that...

421
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,400
no matter what happens,
I want Frank by my side.

422
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,960
What if Frank got a backlash like I did?

423
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,960
Could you bear to see it happen?

424
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,040
Don't you feel bad for him?

425
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,160
It smells like someone's in love,
don't you think?

426
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,400
What's up with you, Sis?

427
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,560
Are you rehearsing or something?

428
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
You can talk to me, you know?

429
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,000
I want to be an older sister

430
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,840
who gives advice to her brother
on lovey-dovey stuff.

431
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,240
I've been seeing someone lately,

432
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,480
but I don't think
we can be more than this.

433
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,640
There's no chance...

434
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,000
between us.

435
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,240
Frank...

436
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,800
listen carefully.

437
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,600
There's a chance.

438
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,560
All that matters is;

439
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,920
first, you truly love them.

440
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
And second...

441
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
that person is sincere with you.

442
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440
If these two things are present,

443
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
then just go for it.

444
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,520
I will be your supporter,

445
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,760
no matter who that person might be.

446
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,920
Okay?

447
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,920
Aww, thank you so much, Sis.

448
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
Well said!

449
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,480
Print, Frank,

450
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,800
I brought some orange juice.

451
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Thank you, Auer!

452
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,920
That's so thoughtful of you.

453
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,040
Anyone would be lucky...

454
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
to have you as their boyfriend.

455
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Um...

456
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,880
Frank and I are
going to have dinner together.

457
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,080
Do you wanna join?

458
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,760
It's alright. You guys enjoy yourselves.

459
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,600
My brother is a big boy now,

460
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,440
no need for me to chaperone,

461
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,720
right?

462
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,800
What are you even saying?

463
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,040
Maybe I've grown just a bit.

464
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,440
Let the fake sister be the matchmaker.

465
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,720
I, the real sister,
shall be the rain on their parade!

466
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm sorry, Frank...

467
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,200
Meet me at the prop room ASAP.

468
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,560
Don't bring anyone else, Frank.

469
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,040
Shit!

470
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,360
Frank...

471
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,040
we need to talk.

472
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,000
Hey...

473
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,800
How did you get here?!

474
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,440
Sis!

475
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,080
So the doll's all ruined?!

476
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
What doll?

477
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,880
Well, the doll you texted me about!

478
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,160
Here.

479
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,960
I will handle this.

480
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,080
- Huh?
- Don't you have plans with Auer?

481
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,560
Just run along.

482
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,480
Go.

483
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,760
How nice it is to be in your body.

484
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Only for you!

485
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,400
Not for me

486
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,200
who has to be stuck
in such a tiny body!

487
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,040
Hey, watch your language.

488
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,200
Don't you forget
that I'm the master of my own body!

489
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,480
Come here!

490
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,320
Print, stop!

491
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
I said stop!

492
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,600
My weakness...

493
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
- Print!
- is my waist!

494
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,400
Ow, knock it off!

495
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,480
Why won't it open?

496
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
The door's jammed!

497
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,480
No!

498
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,960
Don't tell me...

499
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,600
I have to be stuck here with you.

500
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,160
Hello!

501
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
Is there anyone outside?

502
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,040
Is there anyone out there?

503
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,880
Could you come open the door for us?

504
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,520
No...

505
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,040
Is there anyone out there?

506
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I think they all went home.

507
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,120
There's no signal in here at all!

508
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Gosh,

509
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,640
is this really the time
to run out of battery?

510
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,520
Do you have your phone?

511
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,480
Oh...

512
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,840
I may have left it in the room.

513
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,000
I guess we'll have to wait

514
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
until Fon and Mai come look for us.

515
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Now, I can't stop Auer and Frank
from being together!

516
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,480
Hey,

517
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
are you serious?

518
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,400
You're really gonna
mess with their relationship?

519
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,920
Yep,

520
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,720
if those two get together,

521
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,080
I'll tell Frank to break up with Auer.

522
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,240
You're acting like
an evil mother-in-law,

523
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
do you realize that?

524
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
Here,

525
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,520
please take a seat, Miss Rey.

526
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Thanks.

527
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Let me ask you this.

528
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,760
Is the only reason
you don't want Frank to date Auer

529
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,280
because...

530
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,320
you're concerned
about him dating a celeb?

531
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Seeing how a famous actress like you
got so much hate

532
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,040
after getting shipped with Auer…

533
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,360
I couldn't imagine
what an ordinary person like Frank

534
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,760
would have to go through.

535
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,520
I don't want my loved ones
to ever experience that.

536
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Mm...

537
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,840
I understand

538
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,160
that you care about your brother.

539
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,160
But do you really think

540
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,880
you can forbid their love?

541
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,920
Think of it this way;

542
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,120
when you're in love with someone,

543
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,400
you can't even stop yourself

544
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,160
from staring at them.

545
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,640
The more you try not to think of them,

546
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,080
the more you fail.

547
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,840
Do you really think

548
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,520
you can forbid your heart from loving?

549
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,680
No...

550
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,680
I really can't...

551
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,320
Sis!

552
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,240
Frank, why are you here?!

553
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,800
Don't you have somewhere to be?

554
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
It...

555
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,640
It just bothered me
leaving my sister to handle it alone,

556
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
even though I should be
the one responsible.

557
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
So I went to find materials
to fix the doll.

558
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,280
But...that would mean...

559
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,040
Auer is alone at the restaurant?

560
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
You're right. I haven't called him...

561
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,160
It's fine, Sis.

562
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,600
It's just a meal.

563
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,440
I can reschedule it.

564
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
You can't!

565
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,840
Screw that doll.

566
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,920
We'll take care of it.

567
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,680
Go find Auer right now!

568
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,880
Auer!

569
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm so sorry...

570
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,800
Please don't be mad at me.

571
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,640
I thought I had to throw away
this beautiful occasion.

572
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,920
This beautiful occasion?

573
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,280
I don't know how long this will last,

574
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,240
but I can say for certain

575
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
that I want to
make our relationship public.

576
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,760
But you do realize

577
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,720
that if we do,

578
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,880
there will be those who are supportive

579
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,120
and those against us, right?

580
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,880
However, I promise

581
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,320
that I will hold on tightly
to your hand

582
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,840
while we walk through this path.

583
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,920
Will you be my boyfriend?

584
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,120
Mm!

585
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,080
Your bracelet.

586
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,160
Thank you.

587
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,960
That's more like
the big sister of the family.

588
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,280
Just you wait, if Auer ever hurts Frank,

589
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,760
I'll make sure
I'm Auer's No. 1 anti-fan.

590
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,880
You'll see.

591
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,600
Is that so?

592
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,040
Would you do that?

593
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,360
Don't you just wish
you could meet your true love?

594
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Well...

595
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,800
have you come across one?

596
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,360
True love?

597
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,200
No.

598
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,120
Apart from working...

599
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,680
what time do you think I have?

600
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Well, do you know...

601
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,520
what true love looks like?

602
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,120
Hm...

603
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,520
For me?

604
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,200
I like someone
who's good at taking care of others...

605
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,760
thinking on their feet...

606
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,880
and...

607
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,440
someone who loves their family.

608
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,800
Hey,

609
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,640
what about you?
What's your idea of true love?

610
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Not spilling it!

611
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,440
What?

612
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,680
That's cheating!

613
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,280
I already told you mine!

614
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Nothing I can do 'bout that

615
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,600
since you chose to say it.

616
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,160
You better hope I never find out

617
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,760
because I'll be taunting you
all day and night!

618
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,240
- Mai,
- Hm?

619
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,800
can I talk to you about something?

620
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,640
Mm, go on.

621
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,800
About the vlog that I do with Rey...

622
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,760
Uh-huh.

623
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,840
I don't want it
to focus on the ship anymore.

624
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,440
I want to respect my boyfriend.

625
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,720
I can understand that,

626
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,160
but it's not possible to just stop

627
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,920
since this has been agreed
with the sponsor.

628
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,960
How about this, Auer?

629
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,800
Just switch the show a little

630
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,200
into you interviewing the people on set.

631
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,960
I think the audience will love
seeing the set with you in it.

632
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,960
That's a good idea, Fon.

633
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Thank you so much.

634
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,000
Of course.

635
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,320
I guess we can't help it.

636
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,480
Feelings are impossible to stop,
aren't they?

637
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
You'll realize soon enough

638
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,920
once you're more experienced.

639
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,320
That quote must be
from the 18th century.

640
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,480
Does your heart still hold true,
Mr. Prachak?

641
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,720
Auer,

642
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,120
I'm sorry I wasn't supportive
of you and Frank earlier.

643
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,120
It's all good.

644
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,320
I understand
that you're worried about us both.

645
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,600
I guess when you fall madly in love,

646
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,720
you'll understand us.

647
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,560
Shut up!

648
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
You've got a crush?!

649
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:23,880
Shush!

650
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,800
Keep it down!

651
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,640
Who is it?

652
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,680
Can you tell me?

653
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,560
Think of it as a trade.

654
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,360
Swear you won't tell anyone this!

655
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,040
Alright.

656
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,240
We are our only friends;

657
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
who else would I tell?

658
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,040
The person I have a crush on...

659
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,520
is...

660
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,800
Print.
