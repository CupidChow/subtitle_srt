facing a serious allegation
of a skincare hoax

related to "Actress P."

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Here's the story:

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,320
this scandal involves Actress P,

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,640
whose past photos
are being exposed by netizens,

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,120
revealing that she posted reviews
of said skincare on her social media.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,680
This has caused immense damage so far.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920

the skincare was a scam,

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
I deleted all the posts,

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,640
canceled all the sales,
and recalled all the products.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
It does seem strange...

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,280
This was a while ago;
why is it being exposed now?

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
It's because of me.

It's no use, Rey.

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,920
In any case, it's partly my fault.

I would like
to apologize to all the victims

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,320

partly responsible for the matter.

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,560
I truly am sorry.

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,640

done by my past actions,

62
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,120
I have come
to a conclusion with the director

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,520
And who will be Rey's partner, then?

67
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
Have you had anyone in mind?

68
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,280
Will the project be canceled?

if you're sure the casting director
doesn't have an outfit for you,

112

one that fits the character.

00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,520
Hey!

186
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,360
[Rey: I've arrived on set]

187
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,520
You're here, Rey?

188
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,840
Hi, Nicha.

189
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,600
Hi there.

190
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Thank you, ma'am.

191
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,120
I'm so happy

192
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,680
that you'll play the role
of my daughter.

193
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,080
I feel the same
having the chance to work with you.

194
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Look,

195
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,520
if you need any help,

196
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,640
don't hesitate to tell me.

197
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,160
Of course.

198
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Sir!

199
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm here for a job interview.

200
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
There's no reason
to be nice when you're evil.

201
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,440
And we...will reunite again

202
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,720
on the Milky...

203
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,400
Cut!

204
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,120
Wow.

205
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,520
She's amazing.

206
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,960
She really is.

207
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,520
I'll contact you later.

208
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,200
Thank you very much, Print.

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Please go ahead that way.

210
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Who the heck
called her for the audition?

211
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,040
Isn't she the one
with that fresh scandal?

212
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,880
Do you want our project to be screwed?

213
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,160
Jeez.

214
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,960
Ahem!

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,760
We made a promise, didn't we?

216
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,600
I was just...

217
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
putting it on silent mode.

218
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,760
Well, do it.

219
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,960
Okay!

220
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,640
- Is it on silent?
- Mm...

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,680
Then,

222
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,080
I'll keep it safe for you.

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,680
- Now, get back to teaching!
- Alright, baby.

224
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,880
Put your hand here.

225
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,200
You did an amazing job
in that scene, Rey.

226
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm not surprised

227
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,840
that you've become
a top-tier actress at such a young age.

228
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,640
All thanks to you,
Nicha, for your emotional delivery.

229
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,120
For a second there,
I thought you were my real mother.

230
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,560
I'm getting pretty hungry.

231
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,120
What should we eat?

232
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,360
What do you want to have?

233
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,000
How about we make something at home?

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,560
There are seven days in a week,

235
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,760
and yet we dine in eight days a week.

236
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm bored of that.

237
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
It'd be nice to dine out
once in a while!

238
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,720
Uh...

239
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,920
Then,

240
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
give me my phone.

241
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,080
I'll look up
something nice to eat around here.

242
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,920
Fine.

243
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
Only for searching for
restaurants, though.

244
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,760
I'll go to the restroom real quick.
I'll be right back.

245
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,760
"Send the file ASAP."

246
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,240
Why now?

247
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
- Oh...
- Argh!

248
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,640
Ouch!

249
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,560
Mai, what in the world are you doing?

250
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,520
I lost my contact lens.

251
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,200
- Huh?
- Yeah...

252
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,240
How did you even lose it?

253
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,280
Wait...

254
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,320
I think we should head back
to the office.

255
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,360
Just to put
my contact lens back on, alright?

256
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,840
Alright, fine. Let's go.

257
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,720
It stings.

258
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,880
- This way.
- This?

259
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,560
- I said this way!
- Alright, alright.

260
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,200
Fon!

261
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,880
Just wait here.

262
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,480
I'll just take a sec to put it back on.

263
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,480
Be right back.

264
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,400
Fon!

265
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,360
If anyone ever asks...

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,520
what your girlfriend's name is,

267
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,680
are you gonna say it's "Work"?

268
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,120
It's...

269
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,280
an urgent matter, Fon.

270
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,200
Alright,

271
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,600
white flag.

272
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,360
I admit I broke our deal today.

273
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Mai,

274
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,160
do you think that I asked you on a date

275
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,720
just because I wanna win?

276
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,000
Do you think this is a competition?

277
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,880
I'm not...

278
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,800
I don't wanna
defeat you like I did before!

279
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,160
- I really want to spend time with you!
- No...

280
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,880
I understand now.

281
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,840
Do you think I'm that easy?

283
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,080
You think you'll win me over
with a simple apology?

284
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Fon...

285
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,600
how can I make it up to you?

286
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,280
Hm?

287
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,800
How?

288
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
Don't be mad at me, please?

289
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,480
Does this work?

290
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,920
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm very sorry.

292
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Please?

293
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,240
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,360
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,560
Forgive me, pretty please?

297
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,960
Cut it. Stay still.

298
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,560
A bad girl

299
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
must be punished.

300
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,000
[I won't break another promise]

301
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,480
Sign it.

302
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,040
You're home, Rey?

303
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,920
Can we just stay like this for a while?

304
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,360
My wishes didn't work, did they?

305
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,280
Look at how negative my image is now.

306
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,000
No one's interested
in what I can offer anymore!

307
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,960
If they're not interested in you here,

308
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,880
then...

309
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,520
should we go somewhere else?

310
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,520
Somewhere else?

311
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,920
Nicha recommended me
a film by a Korean producer.

312
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
If you're interested,

313
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,120
we gotta send them an audition video.

314
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,880
But it's already midnight, Rey.

315
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,360
If I force it,

316
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,720
will it even turn out well?

317
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,160
It depends on...

318
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,440
if you want me
to be your personal director.

319
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,560
If you're my personal director,

320
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,160
there's no need to pay me a dime.

321
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,600
All I ask for is a little support...

322
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,360
Are you ready?

323
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,280
Three, two, one...

324
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
And, action!

325
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
Without you by my side,

326
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,720
how am I supposed to live?

327
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,680
Without me by your side,

328
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
your life might be easier.

329
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,480
That's true.

330
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,160
My life...

331
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,040
would be just as before you came in

332
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,800
Just me by mysef

333
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,120
When everything was simplier

334
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,080
I could do whatever I wanted

335
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,200
whenever I wanted

336
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,800
More peaceful

337
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,000
...and far less chaotic

338
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
But...

339
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,680
I wouldn’t be as happy as I am now

340
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Thank you...

341
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,240
for fulfilling my life

342
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,320
with so much meaning.

343
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,960
Okay!

344
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,920
You...

345
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
are the greatest blessing in my life.

346
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,560
Is it bad?

347
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,120
Print...

348
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,760
that was an amazing performance!

349
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,120
How come you slay so hard?!

350
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,440
Girl!

351
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
- Darn!
- Gosh,

352
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,440
Fon, you're so extra.

353
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm not!

354
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Your acting was epic!

355
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,440
Be more confident in yourself.

356
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,480
And when will you know the result?

357
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,280
As far as I know, within this month.

358
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,960
But I don't know
if it's gonna make the cut.

359
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
Girlie,

360
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,240
stop overthinking it.

361
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,800
I think you have a shot,

362
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,680
considering you're a front-runner
for the Best New Actor award.

363
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,920
Alright,

364
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,160
cheers!

365
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,360
Cheers!

366
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,360
Rey!

367
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
What are you doing out here?

368
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,560
You'll get eaten alive
by the mosquitoes.

369
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,880
If you won the award,

370
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,280
what would be your acceptance speech?

371
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,040
Hm...

372
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,040
I guess that never crossed my mind.

373
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm not even sure I'll get it.

374
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Have you heard about manifestation?

375
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,560
Word is...

376
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,000
if you envision
something vividly in your head,

377
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,880
it might come true one day.

378
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,720
This award

379
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,680
is not only a declaration
of my position as the Best Actress,

380
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,800
but it is also

381
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,160
a testament to all my dedication

382
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,560
and effort,

383
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,000
as well as that
of the staff from The Doll Mansion.

384
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,280
I would like
to share this award with the crew,

385
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,880
those who never leave my side,

386
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
and those that I love.

387
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,960
This award...

388
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,960
also belongs to Print.

389
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,840
Wait a sec.

390
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,360
Are you really gonna go all out?

391
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
No,

392
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,560
it's just...

393
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,800
I can't say all this on the stage,

394
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,960
so I want to say it to you today, Print.

395
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,680
Mm!

396
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,080
Can I ask you something?

397
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,160
Are you really
not gonna talk to your mother?

398
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,200
I know that,

399
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,880
in reality,

400
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,560
you also feel bad

401
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
for leaving her like this.

402
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Are you not angry at her?

403
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm not.

404
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,640
Think of it this way:

405
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,240
what would you do

406
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,560
if someone's the reason
your daughter gives up her future,

407
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,160
refuses to work abroad,

408
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
and abandons her dream entirely?

409
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,840
If that were me,

410
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,760
I'd also hate their guts.

411
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,480
Hello?

412
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,960
Mai, where are you?
I'm already here.

I did, Sis.
That was brutal!

I feel so bad for Rey.

422
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,640
Feel bad about what?

426

Does Mother know?

427
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,280
Miss Duen
already knows about this, Rey.

428
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,080
And why...

429
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,600
The reason she puts up with it

430
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,040
and hasn't filed for a divorce

431
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,520
is that she's afraid
she couldn't take care of you.

432
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,280
She's afraid...

433
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,320
your father's side
of the family will cut you off,

434
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,120
especially your grandfather,

435
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,800
who never accepted
your mother to begin with.

436
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,160
And the reason
she forces her dream on you

437
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,200
is not only because of herself.

438
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Please?

439
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,960
Of course.

440
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,200
Rey, thank the teacher.

441
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,200
But she wants them to accept you.

442
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,720
She's always worried about you.

443
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,480
She calls me
to check on you all the time.

444
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,720
Rey!

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,280

everyone's waiting for...

450
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,880
The announcement
of the Best Actress of the Year.

451
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,040
We will now find out

452
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,480
which actress gives
the most touching performance

453
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,240
this year.

As for this moment,

455
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,640
I hereby welcome
Miss Asamapon Samakphan,

456
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,280
last year's Best Actress

457
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,160
to please honor us
by presenting the award.

458

460
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,120
goes to...

461
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,320
Miss Rey Radubdao

462
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,120
from The Doll Mansion!

463
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,280
Congratulations!

464
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
Congratulations.

465
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,520
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

466
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,680
As a child,

467
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,440
I used to stand in front of a mirror

468
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,280
with a bottle of water in my hand,

469
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,200
practicing my award acceptance speech.

470
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,240
But now that the day has arrived,

471
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,040
all those fancy words
just disappear from my head.

472
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,800
All that's left now

473
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,560
is how thankful I am

474
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
for Pong, the director,

475
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,920
and the crew members
of The Doll Mansion.

476
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,160
Thank you, everyone, for your support.

477
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,480
Most importantly,

478
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,520
I wanna thank the person
who has always supported me,

479
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,680
taken the time to push me forward,

480
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,240
and put up with everything for my sake.

481
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,000
Without her,

482
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,520
I wouldn't...

483
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,200
I wouldn't be here.

484
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,680
Thank you, Mother,

485
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,840
for everything you've done for me.

486
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Without you...

487
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,320
I wouldn't be who I am today.

488
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,360
For that reason,

489
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
this award

490
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,560
is not only mine,

491
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,640
but my mother's, too.

492
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,560
Right,

493
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,600
how was your mother's hospital visit?

494
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,000
Why?

495
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,320
If you're worried,
why don't you ask me directly?

496
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,640
- Uh...
- Hm?

497
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,920
Sorry, Mother...

498
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,520
I mean, Auntie.

499
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,360
I...

500
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,840
I didn't know you were coming along,

501
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,320
- so I...
- So you what?

502
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,360
You don't want me here?

503
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,160
It's not like that! You can come...

504
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,960
So...what brings you here, Auntie?

505
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,880
I just want to pay a visit
to my daughter's girlfriend's home.

506
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
"My daughter's girlfriend"?!

507
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,560
Mother, please stop teasing her.

508
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
She's all shaken up.

509
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
I never knew
my daughter-in-law is easily scared.

510
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,120
I thought you were the spicy kind.

511
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,400
Auntie!

512
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,760
"Mother."

513
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Pardon?

514
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,800
"Mother."

515
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,520
Whoever told you to call me Auntie?

516
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,720
Take care of Rey for me.

517
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,080
And I apologize
for everything in the past.

518
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,320
Of course, Mother!

519
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,240
Mother!

520
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,960
Mother!

521
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,440
- Are you getting used to it?
- I am!

522
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,320
I think we should have
someone fix Print's hair.

523
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,560
Toei, go take a look
at Print's hair, please?

524
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,400
Got it.

525
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,040
Excuse me.

526
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,360
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

527
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,880
- How does it look now?
- Good.

528
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Thanks.

529
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,320
Alright, we're gonna start now.

530
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,200
Let's go.

531
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,320
Five, four,

532
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,200
three, two, one...

533
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,000
Please welcome, Print and Rey!

534
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,640
Hello.

535
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,200
Hi, and welcome back.

536
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,120
I'll just cut to the chase.

537
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,560
Last time, you told us

538
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,240
you were besties,

539
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,920
but, from the look of it...

540
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm smelling something sus...

541
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,240
Can you tell us loud and clear

542
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,360
what your relationship is?

543
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,080
Are you a shipped couple
or a real couple?

544
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,200
We are...

545
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,200
Traffic's at a dead stop, Print.

546
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
I think there's another crash
by the next intersection.

547
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,440
Fon, I think it's time for plan B.

548
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Alright!

549
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
Sir!

550
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,040
Could you please
give her a ride to this place?

551
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,760
Just follow the navigation here.

552
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,200
Alright, get on the back!

553
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,160
Okay, go!

554
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,280
See you there, Fon.

555
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,680
Alright, sit tight!
