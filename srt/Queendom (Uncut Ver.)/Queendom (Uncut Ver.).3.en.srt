get back inside.
It's not your cue yet.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,360
I got it.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,680
- Sorry.
- Come this way.

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,640
After all these competitions,

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,520
I don't think you're nervous anymore?

25
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,560
Here.

26
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Your skirt looks dirty right here.

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
I'll help get that off for you.

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,040
Thank you.

29
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,160
Mm!

30

Welcome to Print's rented house!

This is what they call,

"There's no place like home."

43

Your house is always a mess.

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,040
I've been away for a week,

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,560
and Frank's staying over
at his friend's place.

46

Mm.

how to help you switch back to your body.

I'm meeting with a detective
to find the Mysterious Person.

Don't fight. Got it?

Got it?

Righto!

58

Come help me change the sheets.

59
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,480
But this is your house.

60
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
Aren't you the one
who's supposed to do that?

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,440
When I stayed over at Miss Rey's chamber,

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,240
she graciously let me sleep on the couch.

63
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Is that what you want?

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,360
Is it?

65

I'm gonna take a shower first.

66

my room's bigger than average!

67

Mai!

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,720
Huh?

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
I wanna talk to you about something.

72
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,680
How about I send you all the details?

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
Just a sec.

74
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,320
Oh!

75
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,240
Almost there.

76
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,200
Almost.

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
Have you found it?

78
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,560
Who the heck is calling now?!

79
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
Ooh!

80
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Found it!

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,840
What?

83
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,280
Oh, you called?

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,000
I had no idea.

85
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Um...

86
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,680
That was in my contacts a long time ago.

87
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,920
I'll...

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,160
About the Green Serpent Goddess...

89
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,440
I'll forward the email to you.

90
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
- Mm.
- Right.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
Oops, this way.

92
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,160
I don't think we both can fit on this.

93
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,480
Don't be so dramatic, Miss Rey.

94
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
The bed's not that small.

95
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,520
It's comfy and big enough.

96
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
I can sleep in Frank's room.

97
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
We don't have to share such a small bed.

98
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,360
Go ahead if you want him
to come after both of us.

99
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,720
He's very protective of
his personal space.

100
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,480
Sit!

101
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,120
Sit.

102
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
There! See?

103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Enough room.

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,760
Only if we squeeze together.

105
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,560
Well, try lying down.

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Try it.

107
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,480
See?

108
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,720
There's barely room for one person.

109
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,680
There is!

110
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,920
Yeah, it's too small.

111
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll sleep on the couch.
You can have the bed.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,560
This way, we don't have to bother Frank.

113
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,080
Don't scratch.

114
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,040
Let me sleep!

115
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,120
Stop scratching.

116
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm allergic to dust.

117
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,840
The more you scratch it,
the more it'll itch.

118
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,160
- It itches no matter what.
- I told you to stop.

119
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,720
You're really something else.

120
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,920
Could you just
take better care of my body?

121
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
You're too soft!

122
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,320
First it was shrimp, now it's dust!

123
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,360
But I'm not soft when it comes to you.

124
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,760
"I'm not soft when it comes to you."

125
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,920
Seriously,

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
when are you gonna clean your house?

127
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Well, not everyone has maids like you do.

128
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,640
I need to go live after waking up.

129
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,240
I don't have time for that.

130
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,520
You need to go live...

131
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Hi, everyone!

132
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
Lately, I haven't had much time.

133
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm filming a series,
so I don't have time to live stream

134
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,080
or even clean the house.

135
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,400
But...

136
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,160
But today,

137
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Rey stopped by my place!

138
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,040
She probably can't stand the mess,

139
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,560
so she'll help me clean up!

140
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,840
Don't you guys know?

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,320
We've been best friends
since we were in school!

142
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,760
That's a lie.

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Are you blushing?

144
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,400
We were joined at the hip!

145
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,400
I can't breathe.

146
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,520
When will you start cleaning?

147
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,360
Hey,

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
don't rub your eyes!

149
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,520
- It's itchy.
- Where?

150
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,360
Print,

151
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,720
your pictures from
the child beauty pageant are adorable.

152
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,480
They even got me in the pics.

153
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,040
You were hella cute!

154
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm showing them to everyone.

155
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,080
Everyone's dying to see our baby pics!

156
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,800
Aren't you gonna let them see?

157
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,880
I remember

158
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,720
how Print won the pageant

159
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,200
while Rey...

160
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,440
only got Miss Photogenic.

161
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,840
You got it wrong.

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Rey is the winner
of the child beauty pageant.

163
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,320
Get the pictures as proof, then.

164
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,880
That way, we'll know
who really got crowned.

165
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,000
Alright.

166
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,840
- Alright!
- Yeah!

167
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,720
We're here.

168
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,600
How can you think...

169
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,840
this looks trustworthy?

170
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,640
You really are clueless.

171
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
People wait in line for a year
just to get in.

172
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,080
I had to pay someone to save a spot,

173
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,040
or we wouldn't be here today.

174
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,040
Yeah!

175
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,440
I did!

except opening doors?

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,760
There.

178

Didn't she say she wasn't superstitious?

179
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,200
Look at her rushing in!

180
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,760
Hey, wait up!

181
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,000
Here we go.

182
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,160
- You okay?
- Why didn't you help?!

183
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,520
That hurt.

184
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,760
Ouch.

185

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,880
Fon,

188
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,120
- let me ask you this,
- Huh?

189
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,880
You!

190
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,480
Commitment is your bane, isn't it?

191
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,120
Be wary.

192
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,240
This time,
they'll be the ones running from you!

193
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,160
Hey, what are you doing?!

194
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,120
Don't leave!

195
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,160
Just sit!

196
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,800
I must apologize

197
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,880
for her ignorance.

198
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,000
She really doesn't know anything.

199
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
We...

200
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,040
We're here today

201
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,960
to ask for your help.

202
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,760
Two of our friends switched bodies.

203
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,280
So I want to ask

204
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,000
if there's any way
they can switch back to their bodies.

205
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,120
They'll have to come themselves.

206
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,520
They...

207
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,000
They've been very busy.

208
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,880
Pictures.

209
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Show me their pictures.

210
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,440
- Here you go!
- Fon!

211
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,400
What the hell, Mai?!

212
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
Do you think it's really worth it

213
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,120
for her to see their faces?

214
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,560
The Green Serpent Goddess told me...

215
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,080
if you pay a gratuity of 15,000 each,

216
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,480
there might not be pictures needed.

217
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,240
This is an assignment from art class

218
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,600
for 'My Dream Job.'

219
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,800
Can anyone guess
what little Print wanted to be?

220
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,160
Let me see it.

221
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,680
Take a guess!

222
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,120
I wanna see.

223
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Time's out!

224
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,880
A nurse!

225
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,360
Isn't it pretty?

226
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,880
Really?

227
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,520
I think I did pretty badly
on the drawing.

228
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,800
Look!

229
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,400
Print, you were so cute!

230
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,120
The only bad thing was
my mom did my makeup too heavy.

231
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,920
Are we cute?

232
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,040
This was actually
our first-ever competition

233
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080

234
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,320
Right?

235
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,640

their last competition against each other,

To be frank,

334
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,400
I also drew on your face in that photo,

335
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,240

about you guys being close friends

342
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,000
is true, isn't it?

345
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,000
people spotted some chemistry
between you guys.

346
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,440
So, a show reached out to us
to do an interview

347
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,640
on how you guys became besties!

348

No.

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,640
"We went on a field trip today.

373
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,160
The teacher told us
to wear P.E. uniform."

374
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,200
"But Rey was the only one who didn't."

375
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,080
"Miss Rey is now Dorky Rey."

376
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,400
"I have a breakout on my chin."

377
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,080
"Someone else does, too, and it's Rey."

378
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,640
"What a coincidence."

379
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,160
"Today, I stood behind Rey
in an assembly."

380
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
"I saw her hiding a candy in her palm."

381
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,160
"After the national anthem,
she even put that in her mouth."

382
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
"She looked hilarious."

383
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,440
Pardon me,

384
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,480
it seems like

385
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,240
you're the one who's obsessed with me.

386
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,880
Well, it's rare to see Miss Rey
looking this goofy.

387
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,760
Anyone would remember.

388
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Good.

389
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,520
Let's make the world think
we hate each other.

390
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Let's bring up

391
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,400
that one moment we looked like friends.

392
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,840
I've got it.

393
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,400
There was only that one time

394
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,720
we were actually nice to each other.

395
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
It was before
we went on stage for Glitter Girl.

396
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,680
Be honest,

397
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,800
why did you help me
with my skirt that day?

398
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,320
I just wanted to keep things fair.

399
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,480
If you went on stage looking that dirty,

400
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,240
you'd lose points right away.

401
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
What about you?

402
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,440
Why did you fix my tie?

403
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,720
Because I didn't want...

404
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
to owe anyone anything.

405
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,200
So...

406
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,440
We'll handle it when we get there.

407
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,960
Other than that, we never looked at

408
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,960
or talked to each other.

409
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,520
Was it all just because we were rivals?

410
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
I was just thinking...

411
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,880
If we never went up against each other,

412
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,320
would we even be friends?

413
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,960
I'm tired.

414
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
Let's go to bed.

415
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,320
Then go to sleep properly in bed.

416
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,680
You sleep in the bed.

417
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,320
I don't want my body
to break out in rashes.

418
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,840
But isn't the couch clean now?

419
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Turn off the light

420
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
and just head to bed.

Without further ado,

433
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
let's start with this question:

434

There have been rumors
about a beef between you two.

435
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Is it true?

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,960

437

Alright...

441
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,800
Well, we still don't buy
that you're besties.

442
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,400
You'll need to answer
all my questions in this game.

444

- Thank you.
- Please take it.

The rule is: we give you topics,

446
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,680
and you'll write down
what the other person likes.

447
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720

Viewers seem to like
Rey being with Print,

466
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,600

I think Print's finally having
her breakthrough.

470
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,800
She's sitting right next to the top star,

471
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,400
yet she's not overshadowed!

472
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,760
Awesome.

Is the high engagement
happening to Print as well?

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,080
Rey is still trending
at No. 1, by the way.

476
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,840
Print still has a long way to go.

477
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,440
There's supposed to be
only one female lead.

478
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,160
Having two might confuse people,

479
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,360

and do some touch-ups.

- Do you mind...

488
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,000
if Rey does a special show
after the break?

Please?

490
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,000
Alright.

491
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Rey,

492
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,160
I've talked to the staff.

493
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,880
You'll perform a special show for them.

494
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,720
Uh...

495
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
But...

496
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,920
Print and I didn't prepare for a show.

497
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,600
And the staff didn't say
anything about it.

498
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,640
It's a special performance just from you.

499
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,480
I had the staff prepare a song for you.

500
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,720
It's the song
you typically perform at events.

501
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,280
How could I be the only one performing?

502
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,640
Print is also today's guest.

503
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,720
Don't you trust my decision?

504
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,640
Or are you nervous?

505
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,600
Hm?

506
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,040
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

507
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,120
It's just like
when you were in Glitter Girl.

508
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
- You did great.
- Rey.

509
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Hey!

This is gonna be big!

00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,080
What's going on?

512
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,280
Why can her mom get backstage?

513
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,840
- You're right!
- Yeah!

514
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,480
What are they talking about?

515
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,800
I've always chosen what's best for you.

516
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,000
The same goes for this one.

517
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,640
I'll make you the star of this show.

518
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,440
So, don't you worry.

519
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,480
Trust me.

520
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,240
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

521
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,840
I won't let you down.

522
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,440
Great job, Rey.

523
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,320
Rey will have a special performance.

524
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,080
What?

525
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,120
Girl, seriously?!

526
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
So self-centered!

527
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,280
She always adds something
during the show!

528
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,640
Alright, whatever.

529
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,960
We're ready.

530
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,640
Alright, ready?

531
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
Three,

532
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,680
two,

533
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
action!

534
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,560
We're now at the final part of the show.

535
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,480
Before we say goodbye,
we have a surprise

536
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,760
for all the Freaky Friday Show fans,

537
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,880
a special performance from Rey.

538
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,640
Are we ready?

539
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,360
If so, please enjoy!

540
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,920
The song I'm performing today

541
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,480
really means a lot to me.

542
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,880
It's a song
I chose to sing in Glitter Girl,

543
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,000
and it was my way into the industry.

544
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,720
Is there anything wrong?

545
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Why is this not the song
I had you prepare?

546
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,000
Rey asked to sing live
before going on stage.

547
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,360
This song is for all of you
who have given me continuous support.

564
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,920
Wow, that was a perfect,

565
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,240
absolutely flawless show.

566
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,960
Thank you, Rey,
for this special performance.

567
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Cut!

568
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

569
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Please come in.

570
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,680
Amazing job, Rey.

571
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,080
But next time, give me a heads-up.

572
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,920
Don't ever surprise me like this again.

573
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,240
Thank you, Mother.

574
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,200
I have a few things to do after this.

575
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,840
Let's meet for dinner later.

576
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,840
There's a movie producer
who'd love to talk to you.

577
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,360
I've got to go now.

578
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,200
Goodbye, Mother.

579
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,640
How was it?

580
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,600
I made up for your off-tune singing.

581
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,600
You better be deserving
of the Glitter Girl title now.

582
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
I made your mom proud.

583
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Mai,

584
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm going back to my place today.

585
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,960
It's the one we met the other day.

586
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,440
There was some bribing going on.

587
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,360
Let's ask others!

588
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,960
- You think what I think?
- Yeah!

589
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,800
Yo, guys!

590
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,920
Here comes the nepotism girl!

591
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,280
[Miss Rey, The Nepo Baby]

592
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,440
She's got some nerves.
[She won because of her mom's backing]

593
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,880
How dare she even show up?

594
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,720
Well, her parents are filthy rich.

595
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,720
- Who did that?
- You did it, didn't you?

596
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,120
- No.
- So, who did that?

597
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Cheater.

598
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,160
[Rey should just drop dead]

599
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,800
Where's the diary?

600
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,480
You hate me,

601
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,400
and I also hate you.

602
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,480
Let's call it even.

603
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
I also drew on your face in that photo,

604
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,360
and it's worse than what you did.

605
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,280
They are definitely fighting
because of that performance.

606
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,560
I don't think it's just that.

607
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,680
They were nice to each other before that.

608
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,080
How could they do that to them?

609
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,440
It'd be good
if that were the only reason.

610
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,600
I think...

611
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,760
it's better if they stay apart for now.

612
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,800
What are you looking for?

613
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,680
My phone.

614
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,560
What?

615
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,560
Is your ringer on?
I'll give you a call.

616
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,360
It is.

617
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,880
[Hearty Wanmai]

618
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Aren't you gonna change the name?

619
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,160
I forgot.

620
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,720
It's just how I put you as a contact,
don't overthink it.

621
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,640
I'll help you find it.

622
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,880
It's fine!

623
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,480
Oh, there it is!

624
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,320
[Smiley Little Fon]

625
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,880
Here are their pictures
from Glitter Girl!

626
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,600
Jesus!

627
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,360
I guess we need to
go back to Chanthaburi.
