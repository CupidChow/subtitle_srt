8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,040
I thought you were gonna be late.

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
What about Fon?

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,640
She's coming, Wanmai.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,880
The girls are ready.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,240
Alrighty.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,880
Here,

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
take this.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,400
Ready?

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,800
Okay, let's go.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Move a little closer.

20
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,040
The chemistry's insane, don't you think?

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,280
Yep,

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,400
I'm starting to think
this is a pre-wedding shoot.

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
A little closer, please.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,800
You're late, as always.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
And pretty, as always.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Hm...

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,480
Maybe prettier than usual?

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,920
Try saying I'm not pretty

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
if you wanna be dead.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,360
What are you doing?

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you for today, everyone.

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,240
Alright, this is gonna be
your last work for the year.

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,600
Get a good rest after this,

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,080
and let's do it again next year.

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,640
Rest up during this three-day holiday.

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,000
I even turned down
the New Year's countdown event,

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,400
so you two can have
some romantic time together.

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,560
So, where are you going
for the New Year's countdown?

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,920
[Wednesday, December 31,
11:59 P.M.]

41
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
Rey, it's almost time!

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,880
Thank you, Rey,

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,480
for making it through this year with me.

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,640
You are the best thing
that has happened to me this year.

45
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
So are you.

46
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
What makes this a good year for me

47
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
is you, Print.

48
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
[Thursday, January 1,
12:00 A.M.]

49
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,120
Happy New Year, Rey.

50
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,800
Happy New Year, Print.

51
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,840
Let's do a countdown together
every year from now on.

52
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
Mm.

53
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,720
Come on, let's get some more drinks.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,080
I'll get some for you.

55
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,040
- Wait here.
- Okay.

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,760
[Happy New Year]

57
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,720
[You passed the audition]

58
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
- Cheers!
- Yay!

59
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
Congratulations on your new company.

60
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,720
I wish for your company
to slay, eat, and leave no crumbs.

61
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,400
Most importantly,
if you ever find a new favorite girl,

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,400
don't forget your original ones!

63
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
Who would ever forget you guys?

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,760
Good.

65
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,440
Then I'll join
your company as the first artist!

66
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Mai,

67
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,480
get the contract ready.

68
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,040
Chop-chop!

69
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,920
- Isn't this too soon?
- Just get it done!

70
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,920
You're impatient, huh?

71
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,200
- Bring it on!
- Right now?

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,480
- Right now!
- Just hang on.

73
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,600
Have you heard back
from the Korean casting project?

74
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Uh, Rey...

75
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,640
Why didn't you tell me you made the cut?

76
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,600
Wait, you knew?

77
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,000
Did you forget
I was the one submitting the video?

78
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
They asked for a secondary contact,

79
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,800
so I put mine down.

80
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,960
You're right...

81
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
Didn't we promise

82
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,160
not to keep secrets from each other?

83
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,040
I wasn't planning
on keeping it a secret,

84
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
but...

85
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,320
I've already decided
I'm not gonna take the offer.

86
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,600
Why is that?

87
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
The project
was recommended to you by Nicha,

88
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,800
and I don't want a job
from your family's home-wrecker.

89
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,880
But this is very important for you

90
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,280
to have another shot
at your acting career.

91
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
Plus,

92
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,000
who recommended this project
doesn't matter as much as

93
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,240
the fact that you earned it
with your skills, right?

94
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Mm...

95
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,280
It's gonna be fine, Rey.

96
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,400
I already turned it down.

97
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,920
I'm sorry...

98
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,760
for not telling you
about my decision before this.

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hello?

100
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Print!

101
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,280
There's a project for you!

102
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,680
What project?

103
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
A Korean agency

104
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,040
just contacted me!

105
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,680
Girl,

106
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,960
I've already told you I didn't make it.

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,040
No! Could you just listen?

108
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,120
This one's another agency.

109
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,320
They watched your audition video

110
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,040
and are really interested in you!

111
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
For real?

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,240
And it's another agency?

113
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,720
Yeah.

114
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,400
They said they wanted you
to sign a contract to work in Korea.

115
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,080
But it's a three-year contract.

116
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,400
Are you okay with that?

117
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
What?

118
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,040
Three years?

119
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,880
That's a long time...

120
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,280
Whoa, guys...

121
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,480
you don't have
to make a big deal out of this!

122
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,600
- You're too extra...
- Hey, hey!

123
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
Frank,

124
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,000
when are you gonna stop crying?

125
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm going to Korea,

126
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,520
not hell.

127
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
But it's three years.

128
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,000
It's gonna be so quiet around here.

129
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,240
Who's even gonna nag at me now?

130
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,400
Alright, don't be so blue, everyone.

131
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,760
It's time for the presents!

132
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
Print, come open these up!

133
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Three, two, one...

134
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Really?

135
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,320
Who are these from?

136
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,880
Those are from us.

137
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm just worried
you're gonna miss Mom's cooking.

138
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,320
Kamsahamnida!

139
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
Next...

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,520
Wait, ginger tea?

141
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,760
It's gonna be cold over there.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,120
This will prevent you from getting sick.

143
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,240
Thank you,

144
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Mother.

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
This one's definitely from Rey!

146
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Girl!

147
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,560
- Is it?
- Mm!

148
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,040
Here I go.

149
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
Aw!

150
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
That's adorable!

151
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,600
No, don't.

152
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,040
Wait, show me!

153
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Let me see!

154
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,520
Give it to me!

155
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,480
- Ooh, that's some lovey-dovey stuff!
- So smoochy!

156
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,080
Show them.

157
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, my God.

158
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,120
It's cute.

159
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
We can do that too, baby girl!

160
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,600
- Thanks, love.
- Can I see?

161
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,120
I wanna see!

162
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,200
Hey, Patty!

163
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,800
This is not for children!

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,040
Why? You saw it!

165
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm a grown adult.

166
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
- I'm also grown.
- Just let her see it. Here.

167
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Where are you taking me, Print?

168
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,720
You'll see.

169
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,520
Is this...

170
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,600
- Uh...
- It's our home, Rey.

171
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,640
It was gonna be for my family,

172
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,840
but I'm just afraid
it's gonna turn into a haunted place

173
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,600
since no one would move in.

174
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
While I'm away,

175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,400
would you take care of the house for me?

176
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,920
You can come here to relax

177
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,080
or lounge around occasionally.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,440
Wait for the day
I come live with you, please?

179
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,360
Are you actually tricking me
into being a maid?

180
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Nuh-uh, that's not it!

181
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
I...

182
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
wanted this house

183
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,720
to be our bridal house.

184
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
How could it be?

185
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
Someone here's not even proposing.

186
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
Uh...

187
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,720
Oh...

188
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,360
Just a sec.

189
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,720
What do I use?

190
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,640
Then, I'm going
to give you a promise ring.

191
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Wait for me to come back, Rey.

192
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,440
Mm.

193
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,480
Then...

194
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,720
I'm saving you for myself, too.

195
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,680
It's Valentine's Day,

196
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,760
but Print is overseas,

197
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,560
and Fon is busy with her schedule.

198
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,280
I guess we're
the two loneliest people in the world.

199
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,600
Flowers wither.

200
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm not really into this kind of stuff.

201
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
It's whatever.

202
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,040
Is it?

203
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,560
This is the first bouquet
I've ever arranged in my life.

204
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
Is it really whatever?

205
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,880
Aww!

206
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,400
It's also the first bouquet
I've ever received.

207
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,880
Yay!!

208
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,080
Aw...

209
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,600
Happy Valentine's Day.

210
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
It reeks of love here.

211
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Print,

212
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,080
my project just got a green light.

213
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,280
Book a flight back home
for my press conference.

214
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,200
Mr. Kim said
your work over the past three years

215
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,920
has been more outstanding
than anyone else's in the agency.

216
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,440
For this reason,
he wants to extend your contract

217
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,360
for another seven years.

218
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,320
What do you think, Print?

219
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,360
[Print in talks to extend contract
seven more years with the same agency]

220
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,240
Congrats, Print,

221
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
for the contract extension.

222
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,560
Let's now talk about
the intense storyline of this series.

223
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,200
I've heard it has something to do
with the entertainment industry,

224
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,400
so can you please give us
a brief summary of the plot?

225
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,440
Right, it's about two famous stars

226
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,840
who have always been competitors,

227
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,440
until one day, when they switch bodies.

228
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,560
Though they wholeheartedly
dislike each other,

229
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,960
they become
more understanding of each other,

230
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,560
so much so that
love blooms between them.

231
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,760
Wow, what a fascinating storyline!

232
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,440
Could you tell us
where you draw the inspiration from?

233
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,520
Actually, it's based on true events

234
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,240
and my first-hand experiences in life.

235
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,000
Alright, let's now
discuss the leads of the series.

236
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,360
Many people speculate
that one of the leads would portray you.

237
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,520
If that's the case, who's the other lead

238
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,080
intended to portray?

239
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,080
The character is inspired by...

240
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,480
my biggest rival

241
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
and closest friend,

242
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,960
someone...

243
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,680
my heart belongs to.

244
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,800
Oh!

245
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
And do you still meet this person?

246
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,840
What is your relationship now?

247
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,920
We don't meet often,

248
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,960
but despite that...

249
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,160
I'm still happy for their success

250
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,720
from afar.

251
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
I think

252
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,640
that's enough to be grateful for.

253
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,040
I have a question!

254
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,280
Gosh!

255
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,360
- Isn't she supposed to be in Korea?
- Right?!

256
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
Whoa!

257
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,240
What if that person doesn't want you
to watch from afar anymore, Miss Rey?

258
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,960
What if they want to be
the one handing you the flowers?

259
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,000
What if they want to clean the house

260
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,040
and celebrate the countdown
with you every year from now on?

261
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,240
It would be lovely

262
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,920
to have you by my side, Print.

263
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,080
Aw!

264
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,000
I decided not to extend the contract

265
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,680
since I feel like Thailand's industry
is a better fit for me.

266
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,720
I didn't throw
that chance away, though.

267
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,600
We agreed to keep
each other's contact info

268
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,040
in case they need me.

269
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,640
If you didn't come back,

270
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,880
some people would feel lonelier
than they already did.

271
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
Who do you mean?

272
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,120
Are you one of them?

273
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,520
I mean your mom, Patty, and Frank.

274
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
What about you, though?

275
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,320
How much have I missed

276
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
after being gone for three years?

277
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,680
Fill me in!

278
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I wanna know everything!

279
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,200
Hm...

280
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,400
Where do you wanna start?

281
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
How about we start with your mother?

282
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,080
I saw the news about her on TV.

283
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,160
Mother made her comeback after 20 years.

284
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,360
Everything went beautifully,

285
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,920
and she's even more famous than me now.

286
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,000
Cut!

287
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,880
- Alright, cut!
- Amazing work!

288
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,280
The workaholics like Mai and Fon

289
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,360
haven't stopped working

290
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
- since they started their company.
- Mai!

291
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm being very serious about this.

292
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,920
You need something
to bring you luck in your office!

293
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,040
Well, I have you!

294
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,400
So, they've been trying
to find their work-life balance.

295
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
- Alright,
- Hm?

296
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,640
let's review our agreement again.

297
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,920
No phones until the movie ends.

298
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,040
- Mai, didn't you put it on silent?
- Hm?

299
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,560
That's not my phone.

300
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,120
Well...

301
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,920
It's probably very important, you know?

302
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,080
Like I said...
They are trying.

303
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,000
- Wait...
- It's them!

304
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,760
- It's really them!
- Excuse me,

305
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,280
can we have a photo?

306
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,560
Please.

307
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,760
Hurry!

308
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
As for Frank and Auer,

309
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,880
though you were afraid
people would be against them dating...

310
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No, I mean, with Frank, too.

311
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,880
- Both of you.
- Yes!

312
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,720
- Alright.
- Please move closer together!

313
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,440
I guess you can relax now

314
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,080
since it's the other way around.

315
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,040
As for your mom's flower shop,
Jake made it better than it already was.

316
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,320
You were worried about her
doing everything on her own, right?

317
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,440
No need to worry now.

318
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,320
Whoa, it's 350 baht?

319
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,000
For such a small bouquet?!

320
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,640
Can't you just give me a discount?
I'm a regular.

321
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,360
Even though it's small,

322
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,240
each flower you see
was very hard to tend.

323
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,200
If you're a regular,
shouldn't you be more understanding?

324
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,840
Patty,

325
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
as you can see,

326
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
grew up to be just like her sister.

327
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,680
She's not the same
Scaredy Patty anymore.

328
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,520
Woo, Patty!

329
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,000
Can't fall asleep?

330
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,960
Mm...

331
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,040
My heart's still racing
from everything you told me.

332
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,360
I didn't know
things could change this dramatically

333
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,360
within just three years.

334
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Right?

335
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,840
Speaking of three years ago,

336
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,600
it reminds me
of when we switched bodies.

337
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,760
It was like
the wildest dream, wasn't it?

338
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,600
Mm...

339
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
I think I now understand

340
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,840
why the Mysterious Person

341
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,040
called us the Moon and the Star.

342
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Why?

343
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,560
Well,

344
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,440
when the moon and the stars reunite,

345
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,720
the sky looks
even more captivating than usual.

346
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,080
But if the moon appears
without the stars,

347
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,000
the sky seems oddly lonesome.

348
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,640
If the stars appear without the moon,

349
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,520
the sky doesn't feel complete, either.

350
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,360
How pretty.

351
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,040
I'll take a picture of it.

352
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,320
Print!

353
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
It's now 11:11 P.M.,

354
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,760
make a wish!

355
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,400
I wish to be with Print
every day from now on.

356
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,240
Your wish will come true

357
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,040
from this second onward.

358
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,560
Will you marry me?

359
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,040
Why are you stealing my thunder?

360
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,480
- Yes, I will.
- Yes, I will.

361
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,680
Thank you.

362
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
I don't know

363
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,880
how we ended up here.

364
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
From rivals to friends,

365
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,800
and from friends to lovers.

366
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,320
I don't know if it's destiny

367
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,640
or the moon and the stars

368
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,480
guiding our way to each other.

369
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,880
But I'm thankful

370
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,200
for your love

371
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,000
and your understanding.

372
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,600
You make me realize the definition

373
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,080
of "You are me,

374
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
I am you.

375
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,720
We are bound by the souls."

376
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,360
And no matter what happens,

377
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,320
you'll never have
to go through it alone

378
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,880
because I'll never leave your side.

379
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,120
I love you, Rey.

380
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,080
From this day forth,

381
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
we're not rivals anymore;

382
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,480
we are the same person.

383
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,640
Print!

384
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,440
Remember: whoever's hand is on top

385
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,600
during the cake cutting
will be the family's matriarch.

386
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,280
Rey,

387
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
don't let your hands be under hers.

388
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,000
You don't like
the taste of peace, do you?

389
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
- Argh!
- Whoa, whoa!

390
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,120
Can we have
a non-chaotic day just for once?

391
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,240
Well, who started?

392
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,080
Kiss! Kiss!

393
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,400
Kiss! Kiss!

394
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,560
Kiss! Kiss!

395
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,640
Kiss! Kiss!

396
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Kiss!

397
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,120
- So sweet!
- That's right!

398
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,080
Be loving, you two.

399
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,520
Cheers!

400
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,840
Do you want some more?

401
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,080
Father, cheers.

402
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,960
I'll get it for you

403
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
and even feed you.

404
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,520
Dear, would you like some cake?

405
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,440
Want some?

406
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,240
Okay.

407
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,720
Let me touch up your face,

408
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,160
dear brother!

409
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,480
Print!

410
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,000
Get a good aim this way.

411
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,240
Rey, throw it this way.

412
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,360
- This way!
- This way.

413
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
- This way!
- This way.

414
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,240
I said this way!!

415
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,800
I'll go take a shower, then.

416
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Hold on there.

417
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,880
I haven't had a bite of my cake yet.

418
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,080
There's still some here.

419
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,240
Want a taste?

420
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
Mm.

421
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,600
Back then, you said

422
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,080
you were so into me

423
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,000
that you didn't see only yourself.

424
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,120
So...who do you see now?

425
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
I see...

426
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,400
you, Rey.

427
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,960
I also see you, Print.
