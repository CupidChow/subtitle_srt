Oh!

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,560
That's the one.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,400
Oh, this too!

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,320
Here.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,040
Look at you gliding like a princess.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,440
I pay, so you carry the bags.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,200
What?
Weren't you the one who sold them?

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,680
Take them!

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,760
What?

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,560
This one's not for sale.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,240
How about this?

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,440
Can I record a video of you
dancing for my kids?

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,320
I'll sell you this model car
if you agree.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,640
Alright. "Print's Payday."

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
Print's Payday.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
Print's Payday...

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,120
Dance like you mean it!

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,920
Alright.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,760
Print's Payday,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,680
Pay Up Babies,

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,880
The Basket Awaits!

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,480
Thank you.

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,880
Thank you, sis!

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,360
Thank you, too.

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,080
Here are free gifts!

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,600
Oh!

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
See?

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,080
We don't have to go separate ways
to work things out.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,480
That's because we haven't figured out
how to switch back to our bodies,

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,000
so I had no choice.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
From this moment forth,

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,360
you are me,

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,360
I am you.

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,440
We're on the same team now.

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,640
Can I ask you something?

44
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,160
What is it?

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
Say it first.

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,480
Should we try bumping our heads?

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Are you insane?

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm not doing that.

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,200
Just once.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,160
We've tried everything, haven't we?

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,280
Mm.

52
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,600
Just once.

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Am I late?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
The bathtub is ready, Miss.

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,320
The bathtub?

56
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,720
Want some?
I bought some for you.

57
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,600
Everything is white!

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Oh!

59
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
This is it!

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,640
This is what I'm looking for!

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,120
From now on,

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,720
I am gonna turn Miss Rey into...

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,680
a fashion icon.

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
You're gonna go do some reforestation
in that outfit?

65
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,400
Reforestation?

66
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,640
Rey,

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,120
be honest with me.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,040
What's going on lately?

69
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,640
You can tell me if you're not okay.

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm fine!

71
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Then, let's get changed.

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,800
Let's go.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,680
I'll give you a recap on the car.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
What reforestation?

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,000
Rey!

76
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
Oh, right.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
Give me my phone.

78
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,640
What do you want it for?

79
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,320
To switch our accounts.

80
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Good idea!

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,880
What if someone called?

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,720
We didn't switch our numbers.

83
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
Well, just text instead.

84
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,240
So, from now on,

85
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,600
we'll text each other to keep up
with schedules and life?

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,400
What freaking reforestation!?

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,400
It's for charity. No big deal.

88
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
It's time to leave!

89
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,080
Okay!

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Print!

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,880
Have you seen our family group chat?

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,280
Nope.

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,800
Our sister got in trouble at school!

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Who?

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,000
Right, what happened?

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
Read the group chat.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,880
Okay.

98
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,040
Frank said your sister
got into trouble at school.

99
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,720
What do I do?

100
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,640
Are you going to her school?

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm not.

102
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm rushing to my internship interview.

103
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,280
- Then...
- You have to go.

104
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,480
Patty is waiting for you.

105
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Didn't someone say
she'd be a better version of me,

106
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,600
one who would wipe out the old me?

107
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,520
I am going to be you.

108
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
I scheduled a meeting with you because,

109
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,280
earlier this morning,

110
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,680
other students said
Patty purposely hosed down Ekkasit.

111
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,200
That's not what happened, Miss.

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,600
I...

113
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,920
I was watering the plants
behind the school

114
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,080
when I saw Ekkasit take money
from another student.

115
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,360
I was just trying to stop them,

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,040
so I sprayed the water
in their direction.

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,400
The real problem is...

118
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,120
the person who was extorting the money.

119
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,560
We don't even know if she's lying.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,880
But one thing for sure is that

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,960
your sister soaked my son
from head to toe.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,760
You okay, my dear?
Hope you're not catching a cold.

123
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,320
How are you going to pay for this?

124
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,640
But Miss...

125
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
We are so sorry.

126
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,000
From what I gathered...

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,920
I think they are both at fault.

128
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,760
Please don't make a big deal out of it.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,760
Uhm...

130
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,160
- Mom, but she isn't...
- Print...

131
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,680
Why didn't you keep that?

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,120
Or don't you trust my decision?

133
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,720
I must apologize on her behalf.

134
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,360
My dear, we've won.

135

[Reforestation Drive:
Protect the Green, Protect Our Planet]

136
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
Could you squeeze in a little?

137
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,680
Here we go.

138
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,800
Smile, please.

139
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,600
Alright.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,400
Three, two, one.

141
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,160
- One more!
- With heart on the cheek pose.

Three, two, one.

143
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,960
- I wanna look young like her.
- One more!

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
Three, two...

145
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,800
Are you sure this is a charity event,
not a fan meeting?

146
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,640
They took way too many pics.

147
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,600
Hm?

148
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Huh?

149
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
Let's go. You need to get changed.

150
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,200
Huh?!

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
There's more?!

152
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,440
Rey!

153
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,200
Are you feeling okay today?

154
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,040
You just said,
"Being me is not all that hard."

155
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
Oh, Rey!

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,280
Your dad took you golfing today?

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Hi, Mister...

158
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Uncle.

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,200
Seeing you here means

160
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,280
you're stepping up
to help your dad, right?

161
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
For the family business...

162
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,680
I think I still have a lot to figure out.

163
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
An acting career would be easy for you.

164
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,480
That's perfect for your pretty face.

165
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't think
there's an easy job out there.

166
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,440
I've put so much effort into acting.

167
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
Even today, I deal with
a lot of disrespectful people.

168
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
I have to act like I'm not offended.

169
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,960
If I were bad at acting,

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
I would have cussed them out.

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,720
Alright...

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
You're being all nice to me.

173
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,320
What do you want?

174
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,600
Who said I was being nice?

175
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,400
I just wanted to kill his vibe.

176
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
What did you say?

177
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,480
Oh...

178
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,840
It's nothing.

179
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
Thank you.

180
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,920
Rey, what are you doing?

181
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,160
I'm hungry, so I'm eating.

182
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,960
It's already 4 P.M.

183
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,560
But you're allergic to shrimp.

184
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,320
Rey!

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,160
Rey!

186
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,960
Rey!

187
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,040
Rey!

188
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Rey!!

189
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
No, Rey!!

190
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
I need some help here!

191
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,960
An antihistamine injection
has been administered.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
She should recover soon.

193
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,640
Thank you.

194
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,520
Rey,

195
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,800
I know you're still awake.

196
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,000
Once I'm back,
I expect you to be ready to talk.

197
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,000
Your body is having an allergic reaction.

198
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,560
Come to the hospital right now.

199
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,560
What? I'm on my way.

200
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,840
Where are you now?

201
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,480
Ugh...

202
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,440
You've finally arrived, Miss Real Rey.

203
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,280
Don't scratch.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Stop scratching!

205
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Don't tell me you ate shrimp.

206
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,880
Who would've known
you're allergic to them?

207
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,880
Why didn't you ask me before having it?

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,520
I don't have time for that.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,120
I had to do some reforestation,
then went golfing.

210
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,320
I was also busy helping out
with your family stuff.

211
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,040
The other student's mom
wasn't giving up that easily.

212
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,760
And your mom was...

213
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,400
She just said sorry
to get it over with, right?

214
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,880
I...

216
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,160
I can never be you.

217
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,040
What do you mean?

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,520
Well, I...

219
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,240
I made your sister
feel disappointed in you.

220
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,200
I can never be you, either.

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,920
What kind of person
has a schedule that packed?

222
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
I don't even have time to eat.

223
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,720
If we tell Fon,
she'll probably believe us.

224
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,960
What about Wanmai?

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,920
Someone like her
would never believe what happened.

226
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,440
Well, what happened?

227
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,240
Shit.

228
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,600
What now?

229
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
She's your person.

230
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,320
So, anything you wanna say?

231
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
Well...

232
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
Print and I...

233
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,560
We swapped bodies.

234
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,600
Wait.

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,200
Mai,

236
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,880
what is she trying
to put in Print's head?

237
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,680
Rey?

238
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Wanmai,

239
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,800
my mom chose you...

240
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,680
out of 200 applicants for this position.

241
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,960
During the interview,

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
you were the only one bold enough
to point out my weakness.

243
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,720
That's why my mom trusted you

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,880
and picked you for this job.

245
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,320
Do you remember
when our car broke down

246
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,800
and we ended up
having a deep talk for two hours?

247
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,160
Print also told this story
during live streams.

248
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,800
But there's one story
Print hasn't told yet.

249
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,760
It's about how you can't move on
from that person.

250
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,400
Want me to let that slip?

251
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
Don't say it!

252
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
That person...

253
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,560
Shh!

254
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,640
- Do you believe...
- Stop!

255
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,800
Do you believe us now?

256
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,200
Alright, I believe you guys!

257
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Hold on...

258
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,080
Are you really Print?

259
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,400
What?

260
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,160
Print?

261
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,160
Oh, Print!

262
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
My sweet girl!

263
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,000
That's why we need your help.

264
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,040
While you're figuring out
how to get back into your real bodies,

265
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,320
you need to live each other's lives
as normally as possible

266
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,920
like you're living your own.

267
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,840
To help the process go faster,

268
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,680
you'll have to move in together.

269
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,160
I think we should stay
at each other's places every other week

270
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,560
to be fair.

271
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,160
Whose place do we start with?

272
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,640
Fair and square,

273
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,120
let's settle this
with Rock, Paper, Scissors.

274
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,000
Good luck, baby.

275
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,080
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

276
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,480
Wow!

277
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,600
Whoa!

278
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,240
What a million-dollar view!

279
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,640
These three drawers are yours.

280
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,240
This space here is mine.

281
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,040
Don't cross the line.

282
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,680
What?

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,080
Why is my space smaller?

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
Because I own this place.

285
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,760
Wow.

286
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
I never thought...

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,160
you'd like something like this.

288
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,120
Hold up.

289
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,360
I'll tell you the rules.

290
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,520
The green scourer is for the plates

291
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,760
and the pink one is for glasses.

292
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,800
Got it?

293
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,800
Do the dishes.

294
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,240

297

Hey,

298
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,960
your spot...

299
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
is over there.

300
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,360
Get up.

301
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,520
Just wait till it's my turn.

302
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,120
Here's your spot.

303
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,360
And this is our working space.

304
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,160
Before you sleep,

305
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,560
have you gone through the script?

306
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,800
Our roles will be switched.

307
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,760
But I've already done the research.

308
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,720
Try to rehearse

309
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,320
with the notes I wrote down.

310
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,040
Thank you, Miss Rey.

311
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,080
If you really want to thank me,

312
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,240
why not work hard on my script?

313
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,520
Hi.

314
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,400
Hello.

315
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Excuse me,

316
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,120
may I check

317
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,480
who entered the building
on the day of Rey's workshop?

318
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,200
Please allow me to refer
to the institution's director.

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,280
Honestly,

320
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
you didn't even have to come

321
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,800
'cause I've got everything under control.

322
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,160
There's no one
resembling your description.

323
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,920
Miss Mangosteen
didn't return to that class either.

324
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,040
Wait.

325
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,720
How is that possible?

326
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,560
That's what she told me.

327
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,600
How about this?

328
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,440
Can I review the security footage?

329
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
I'm deeply sorry.

330
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,000
Our institution does not permit
non-staff to review the security footage.

331
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,080
- But I really need...
- What if we have this?

332
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,240
Can we see the footage now?

I love how the staff here
are following the rules.

In that case,
let's go review the footage.

351

going to file a report?

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
Mm!

374
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,520
[We've found your rider!]

375
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,880
I just got a ride.

376
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm heading out.

377
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,200
What's with you?

378
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,680
Call me if you need anything.

379
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
You got my number, right?

380
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
You just call me if you need anything.

381
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,320
Alright.

382
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,280
Don't worry about the Mysterious Person.

383
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
We'll figure it out.

384
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm gonna find other ways to help them.

385
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,040
Can you lift these?

386
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,000
Is there anyone
who can help me with the setup?

387
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
Can you help move this stuff?

388
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,280
Is the camera ready?

389
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,880
Have you finished the setup?

390
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
We've got to be ready in 10 minutes.

391
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Hello,

392
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
I bought you guys some donuts.

393
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,320
Thank you so much, Rey.

394
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,040
I'll take one.

395
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,280
Everyone, Rey bought us some donuts!

396
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,480
Come grab some.

397
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,440
- Thank you so much.
- Let's take a break.

398
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,160
Rey's bought us snacks!

399
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,760
Let's go.

400
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,480
Thank you so much.

401
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,560
It's nice to meet you.

402
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,760
I promise I'll do my best.

403
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,760
Wow.

404
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,680
Thank you!

405
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,800
Uh...

406
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,840
Hang in there!

407
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
You too!

408
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,440
Thank you.

409
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,560
Care for a donut, Teacher?

410
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,120
Why are you so laid-back?

411
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,560
Stay focused.

412
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
It's time to review your script.

413
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,680
Today's scene is difficult.

414
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,680
I know! I've been rehearsing all night!

415
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,040
Look at my under eyes.

416
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,280
Look.

417
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,360
Here!

418
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,840
It's good that you've rehearsed.

419
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,360
I'll keep an eye on you.

420
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,440
We'll be going to shoot scene 27.

421
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,360
Print will be playing Auer's lover.

422
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,120
Auer, you just realized
you were forced into a marriage,

423
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
so you're sneaking out to meet Print.

424
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,120
That's about it.

425
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,080
- Alright.
- All good.

426
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,280
- I got it.
- Let's give them a room.

427
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,160
- Alright, are you two ready?
- Yes.

428
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Stand by.

429
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,440
Camera,

430
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,280
And action!

431
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,880
Miss Grace,

432
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,960
no matter what,

433
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,160
I want you to know

434
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,040
you're the only one
I want to spend my life with.

435
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,560
But it's impossible for us
to be together, Mr. Prachak.

436
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,520
You're now betrothed to Miss Rin.

437
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,120
Miss Grace...

438
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,440
Please don't make this hard for me.

439
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,800
You told me

440
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,000
to be honest with my feelings.

441
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm gonna break off the engagement.

442
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,840
But if you do that,

443
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,680
your mother won't be happy.

444
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,440
I don't want you to argue with her.

445
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,800
Whoa.

446
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,160
Is this truly her debut acting role?

447
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,400
She's the realness.

448
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Can my body even cry like that?

449
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,160
It's your cue now, Rey.

450
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Miss Rin...

451
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Cut!

452
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,560
Excellent job.

453
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,400
We're moving on to Rey's scene now.

454
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,160
The villain has shown you how it's done.

455
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,520
It's time for the lead.

456
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,000
This is the next scene
after the last one.

457
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,320
Rey's mad
'cause he's in love with someone else.

458
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,440
So, you're gonna slap Auer

459
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,280
and cry out loud.

460
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,960
- Okay.
- That's about it.

461
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,280
Easy peasy.

462
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,520
- Let's do it.
- Ready?

463
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,000
Okay!

464
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,800
Let's get started.

465
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,760
Where do I stand?

466
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,680
Right here on the green mark.

467
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,320
- Okay.
- Alright.

468
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,000
You can really slap me, Rey.

469
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,240
- Alright.
- I'm used to it.

470
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,000
Alright, let's begin.

471
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,680
Camera,

472
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,640
And action!

473
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,320
Mr. Prachak,

474
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,480
I hate you!

475
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,480
Can we start over?

476
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,240
Cut!

477
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Let's start over.

478
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,720
Mr. Prachak!

479
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,880
I hate you!

480
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,440
Cut!

481
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
One more time.

482
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,120
One more.

483
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,040
Let's do it.

484
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,400
Stay focused, everyone.

485
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,120
Camera,

486
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,200
And action!

487
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,720
Mr. Prachak!

488
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,120
I hate you!

489
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,560
Again.

490
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,800
Mr. Prachak!

491
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,280
I hate you!!

492
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,960
Action!

493
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,360
I hate you!

494
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,960
Mr. Prachak!

495
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,560
Mr. Prachak!

496
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,280
I hate you!

497
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,160
Cut!

498
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,360
If this keeps up,

499
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,160
Auer's face is gonna be all bruised.

500
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I'm so sorry.

501
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,240
Can we do it again?

502
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,000
Rey, you never needed more than 10 takes.

503
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,400
This scene...

504
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,920
is not that hard.

505
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm really sorry.

506
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,360
Are you okay?

507
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,280
Stay calm.

508
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,720
Try to stay focused

509
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,520
and close your eyes before you start.

510
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,320
Can I try it my way first?

511
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,560
I know I can do it.

512
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,240
- Right.
- Come on.

513
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Let's do it again.

514
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,800
Alright.

515
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,760
And action!

516
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Mr. Prachak...

517
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,840
I hate you.

518
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,240
Let's go!

519
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,200
Get the tears going!

520
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Tears!

521
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Are the tears coming?

522
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,760
Come on!

523
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,840
I hate you!

524
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,080
Cut!

525
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
Rey, this is...

526
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,480
not your first time acting.

527
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,920
It's not a hard scene, right?

528
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,760
Should we move on
to the other scenes first

529
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,680
and come back to this later?

530
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,480
One of you can't act,

531
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,120
and the other just wants to run the show.

532
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,440
If that's how you want to work,

533
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,520
then do it yourself.

534
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,680
Please calm down.

535
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,040
Hey...

536
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,320
Hey,

537
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,920
you should cry in front of the camera,

538
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,200
not here.

539
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,360
Who cried?

540
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,240
My eyes are just dry
from the contact lenses.

541
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,680
Just memorizing the script

542
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,000
won't get you through the scenes.

543
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,760
What do I have to do, then?

544
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
You wanna know?

545
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,320
Then beg for it.

546
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,760
Tell me.

547
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,280
How should I do it?

548
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,720
First of all,

549
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,400
you need to do as I say.

550
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,280
Everything I say.

551
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,560
Let's start with...

552
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,360
the happiest scene.

553
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,520
Okay...

554
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,400
That's enough.

555
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,360
Your problem is the way
you express your emotions

556
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,720
and act.

557
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
So, what do you think I should do?

558
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,400
Uh...

559
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Alright, try imagining what it's like

560
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,960
to play the happiest person.

561
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,480
What comes to your mind?

562
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Letting myself relax
in a nice Jacuzzi tub...

563
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,600
Wearing pretty clothes...

564
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,320
Breakfast prepared by the maids...

565
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,640
Happiness...

566
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,640
Are you...

567
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,600
enjoying living my happy life?

568
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm not.

569
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,280
It's just my imagination.

570
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,120
Imagination?

571
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,360
Um.

572
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Alright.

573
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,920
That was fine.

574
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,320
How about...

575
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,440
a crying scene?

576
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
I just can't cry no matter what.

577
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,440
In a crying scene,

578
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,720
it's not about forcing the tears.

579
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,560
You have to truly feel it.

580
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,360
Actually,
there's a trick to these scenes.

581
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,080
Try to think of sad experiences
in your life.

582
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,680
That'll help.

583
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,200
Does swapping bodies with you

584
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
count as a sad experience?

585
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,920
Be serious.

586
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,760
Try to think about it.

587
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,680
Are there any sad experiences

588
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,120
you can't forget?

589
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,680
Let me know if you think of one.

590
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Glitter Girl...

591
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,600
If I were you,

592
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,640
I would have felt so hurt.

593
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,920
If you hadn't lost that day,

594
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,680
you would've...

595
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,400
lived in a big penthouse,

596
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,720
lain on a soft mattress,

597
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,840
bathed in a nice Jacuzzi tub,

598
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,680
worn pretty clothes,

599
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,560
and had maids tending to you.

600
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,520
More than that,

601
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,360
you could easily
support your family financially.

602
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,520
If you hadn't lost that day,

603
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,960
today,

604
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,640
you'd be the actress
you've always wanted.

605
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,680
Alright, you ready?

606
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,720
And action!

607
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Mr. Prachak,

608
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,760
I hate you...

609
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,560
Cut!

610
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,680
There you go.

611
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,480
That looks like the Rey we know.

612
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,680
Great job.

613
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,800
Well,

614
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,080
someone was urging her
to rehearse yesterday.

615
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,800
Now she's acting like herself again.

616
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Right...

617
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,600
I'm sorry for the way I talked to you.

618
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,320
No worries.

619
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,720
I really messed up yesterday.

620
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm sorry, too.

621
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Go take a break, Rey.

622
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,320
Come on.

623
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,920
You're awesome.

624
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,440
See?

625
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,920
I can do it if I give it my all.

626
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,040
If you had done it from the start,
we'd be done by now.

627
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Quit crying.

628
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm done reading the script for tomorrow.

629
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,560
I'm off to bed now.

630
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,720
Hold up.

631
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,240
We have a difficult scene to work on.

632
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,280
Check page 27.

633
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,920
But I'm sleepy.

634
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,760
I've been through a lot today.

635
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,400
Can we do it tomorrow?

636
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
[Prachak: But I've never breathed
the word 'love' to anyone but you]

637
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,880
["Prachak makes up with Rin
by kissing her"]

638
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
A kissing scene?

639
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Easy.

640
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,680
Have you ever kissed someone?

641
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,720
Well,

642
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,320
occasionally, yeah.

643
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,120
What tips do you have for this scene?

644
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,640
You have kissed someone?

645
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Why do you ask me that?

646
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,680
What?

647
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,800
Why did you ask me, then?

648
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,360
I've had some experience
with kissing scenes.

649
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,920
If you want it to feel natural,

650
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,400
you have to truly feel it deep inside.

651
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,760
Alright.

652
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,480
For example,

653
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,000
this scene isn't just about kissing.

654
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,880
You need to feel slighted

655
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,160
by the person you're in love with.

656
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,360
Okay.

657
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,120
How hard could it be?

658
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,240
Let's roll.

659
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,640
I'm sleepy.

660
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,280
Come on.

661
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,720
Let's start with blocking.

662
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,080
Try lying down like this, okay?

663
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,880
We'll go with this.

664
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,360
All set?

665
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,560
Mm.

666
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,040
Is there anything else
you want to tell me, Mr. Prachak?

667
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,440
I...

668
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,680
After all this,

669
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,360
you're still going to lie to me?

670
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,160
So,

671
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,880
please listen closely

672
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,240
to what I'm saying.

673
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,160
The first time we met,

674
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,800
I despised you.

675
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,200
Who on earth

676
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,080
could be such a nuisance?

677
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
A nuisance like me

678
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,920
and an insolent person like you

679
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,800
make a perfect match.

680
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,640
I suppose you take pleasure

681
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,200
in making me...

682
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,800
feel this way?

683
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,160
And what way is that, exactly?

684
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,960
Well,

685
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,200
in a way...

686
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,600
I've never felt for anyone before.

687
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
You...

688
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,040
Coming from someone like you,

689
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,560
I bet you say that to all the girls.

690
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,560
But I've never breathed

691
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,000
the word 'love' to anyone

692
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,440
but you.
