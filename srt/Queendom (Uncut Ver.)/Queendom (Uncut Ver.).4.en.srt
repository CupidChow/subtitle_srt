41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,400
Silly girl,

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,160
how could you hug her sister
even before she does?

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
I think she's still upset
about the principal's office.

44
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
Don't hold it against her.

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
Print, why are you scared?

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,200

did these two get so close?

suddenly gets so close.

something important to ask.

even without you.

187
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,480
I mean...

188
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,520
I just don't want you
to get caught up in this.

189
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,680
Since I'm the reason
for him running away...

190
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,840
I should be the one responsible.

191
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,320
Print?

192
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,320
Lifting...

193
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,600
Moving...

194
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,960
Treading...

195
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,720
You're also interested
in meditation, Fon?

196
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,480
Um...

197
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,680
Very much so.

198
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm all about meditation,
spiritual exercise, and precepts.

199
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,120
I've even been to
all those admired temples!

200
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,920
People who speak untruths
break the fourth precept, right?

201
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,800
Please pay no attention to the voices.

202
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,360
Let us continue
with the walking meditation.

203
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,880
Since we're both awakened souls,

204
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,480
could I possibly talk to you more
about spirituality?

205
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you believe in astral projection
and body switching?

206
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
I definitely do.

207
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,640
If you practice enough
spiritual exercise,

208
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,080
you can eventually astral-project.

209
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,040
For real?!

210
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,800
Quiet down.

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,160
Sorry.

212
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,840
- Sorry!
- Alright.

213
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,800
Have you actually done
astral projection?

214
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,200
Good heavens, Fon!

215
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,960
I think this is rather beyond
the scope of meditation.

216
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,840
Why don't we continue our meditation?

217
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,880
Yeah?

218
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,200
I'll be frank with you, ma'am.

219
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,200
We've traveled all the way here
to ask for your help.

220
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
- I don't think it would be immoral,
- Hey!

221
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,200
- asking for 10 minutes of your time.
- Quiet!

222
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,920
Do you know the person in this photo?

223
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,560
I don't think so.

224
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,440
It doesn't ring a bell at all.

225
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,560
Wait,

226
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,080
but you two even embraced
each other so closely in that.

227
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
Like this.

228
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,240
I only remember

229
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,120
how hectic the photo shoot was

230
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,520
that I didn't even notice
if anyone hugged me.

231
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,120
Hold on...

232
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
When you asked me about body switching,

233
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,280
does it have anything to do with her?

234
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,360
Mm...

235
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,840
Yeah, something like that...

236
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,240
Hm...

237
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,520
I'm not sure

238
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,160
if this can help...

239
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,880
I once meditated

240
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,520
until my soul took over
the body of someone I disliked

241
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,640
at this meditation center.

242
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Are you serious, Miss?

243
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,560
So it's body switching?

244
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,200
At the time, I remember

245
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,160
I spent quite some time in their body.

246
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,240
I suspect
what you two are curious about

247
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,840
might be something like this?

248
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,320
Here,

250
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
for the awakened soul.

251
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
You talked about meditation
with her for so long;

252
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,400
you must be thirsty.

253
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,200
Print!

254
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,960
Where are you?

255
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,920
This is not funny anymore.

256
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,320
Didn't you say
you could do it without me?

257
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,560
There, take a water break,

258
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,160
and we can look for Googie after.

259
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,080
I wasn't trying
to mess with you earlier.

260
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,240
I thought you might feel hot,

261
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,680
so I bought you a bottle of water.

262
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
But by the time I got back,

263
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,480
you were gone.

264
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,640
Mm.

265
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,200
Fixed it.

266
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,720
Thanks.

267
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,360
And where next
should we look for Googie?

268
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,480
No clue.

269
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,680
If he's not around our house,

270
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,400
I don't know where he could be.

271
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Should we file a police report?

272
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,320
Look at him.

273
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
A dog sitting patiently for its owner

274
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,480
is adorable, isn't it?

275
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,440
Yeah.

276
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,440
Googie also does this.

277
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,120
Mm...

278
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,880
Come on, boy. Let's go home!

279
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,200
Get on the scooter.

280
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,160
Come!

281
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,400
Come on!

282
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,720
I know where to find Googie!

283
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,720
- Googie!
- Googie!

284
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Googie!

285
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,880
Googie!

286
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,880
There you are, Googie!

287
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,800
Googie!

288
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,960
Come!

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,680
Right,

290
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,000
how did you know he'd be here?

291
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,840
My family used to come here on weekends.

292
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,040
Alright, cheers!

293
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,560
Drink up.

294
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,680
I'll pour you more.

295
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,520
Thanks, Dad.

296
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,000
- Pour it for me, too!
- Here you go.

297
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,320
- This is delicious. Can I have more?
- Drink up.

298
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,640
- For Mommy, too.
- Alright.

299
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
- I even sang the song myself!
- You did?

300
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,800
- Yeah!
- You took after your mom!

301
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,880
And during weekdays,
Dad would take Googie here to play.

302
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,000
We watched the sunset together
almost every day.

303
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,280
But since he passed away...

304
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,480
we never visited this place anymore.

305
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
It just reminds us of him.

306
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
But, coming here today,

307
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm starting to regret it.

308
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,960
Why didn't I come here more often,

309
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,240
even though...

310
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,840
this place holds
remembrances of my dad and me?

311
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,960
I'm not as good as my friend
from the dancing class.

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Look, there are
different types of dancing.

313
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,800
Why don't we try...

314
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
the hilarious, ugly kind?

315
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,160
How, Dad?

316
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,120
I'll show you.

317
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,440
Am I doing it right?

318
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,600
Yeah!

319
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
- Give it your all!
- Alright, Dad!

320
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,320
Be yourself.

321
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,640
Yeah!

322
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,760
What do you think?

323
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,760
You're getting there!

324
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
There!

325
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,760
- Look at you!
- You need to dance along!

326
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,440
- Do I?
- Yes!

327
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
What's this move? Snake?

328
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
This is a snake dance.
You just go...

329
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,400
See?

330
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,640
In high school, I promised my dad...

331
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,760
I'd become an actress

332
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,880
and win Glitter Girl.

333
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,440
But at last...

334
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm the reason why

335
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,480
you couldn't keep your promise.

336
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,520
You also feel bad?

337
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,480
Didn't you say...

338
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,720
you also drew on my face?

339
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
You don't actually hate me
like you always said you did.

340
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,600
Mm...

341
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,760
Why would I hate someone
who got second place?

342
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,040
Hey, Googie,

343
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,360
do you even know I'm not your Print?

344
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,920
Do you?

345
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,720
Try petting him.

346
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,760
He likes to be petted over here.

347
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Don't you, boy?

348
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
No, do this.

349
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Like this?

350
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,040
Auntie, can I leave Googie
with you for a bit?

351
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,120
I'll be back soon to pick him up.

352
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

353
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,680
We'll be right back!

354
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,360
Bye!

355
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,160
Three, two, one!

356
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,240
Why aren't you going up?

357
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,640
- Here's our home!
- Chanthaburi.

358
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,080
[Sukhaphiban Alley]

359
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
- How cute!
- Have a look around.

360
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,400
- Stop!
- Oh!

361
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
You want some ice cream?

362
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,960
This is the province's signature,
Chanthaburi durian!

363
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,800
Come taste how sweet and creamy it is!

364
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,320
I don't eat durians.

365
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,640
Just try a bite!

366
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,120
You won't be able to stop!

367
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,200
Cheers!

368
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,960
Googie!

369
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Patty,

370
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm really sorry,

371
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,840
both for losing Googie

372
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,000
and the principal's office.

373
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
I'm not mad at you;

374
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,120
I'm just a little upset.

375
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,080
Eat however much you want.

376
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
I'll go get more
sesame marinated pork.

377
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,240
Oh, it's alright!
I'll do it.

378
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,880
No, you guys are the guests,

379
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
so let me take care of you.

380
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,680
Patty, come give me a hand.

381
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,600
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you!

382
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
Thank you.

383
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,160
Thanks, Patty!

384
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,120
What?

385
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Why aren't you eating?

386
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,120
Don't tell me you've never eaten
Thai barbeque before?

I have,

388
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,720
but... it's not really healthy for...

From now on,

00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,720
you can use my body

391
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,400
to do or eat whatever you want!

392
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,240
I'll be the one on a diet,

393
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,320
keeping this body in shape.

394
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,960
You don't mind, do you, Mai?

395
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,040
Do I look like that cruel a person?

396
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,800
You do, alright?

397
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,600
I'll call it a cheat day today.

398
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Here's to our friendship.

399
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,680
Let's go.

400
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,360
- Yes!
- Yeah!

401
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,240
Rey, you are still as lovely
as you were the first time we met.

402
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,600
What was that competition again?

403
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,840
The child beauty pageant.

404
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,880
That's right! The child beauty pageant!

405
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
That's right.

406
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,800
Rey is the winner
of the child beauty pageant.

407
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,880
That's not it!

408
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,640
Get the pictures as proof, then.

409
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,240
Do you remember who won the pageant?

410
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
I remember that...

411
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,400
Print did, right?

412
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,800
I don't think that's true.

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,440
The winner was most likely Rey.

414
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,800
Girl, it was definitely you!

415
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,480
It was you,

416
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
wasn't it, Mom?

417
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,160
I remember...

418
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,160
that Rey won that year!

419
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,240
See?

420
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,640
For real?

421
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,040
Do we have any pictures
from the award moment?

422
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,120
We don't.

423
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,920
But if you really wanna know, Rey...

424
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,000
I think the school's activity room
still has the photos.

425
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,600
Wanna check out the school?

426
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,040
Let's confirm the real identity
of the winner.

427
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,680
No.

428
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,440
Why would I?

429
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,040
Just Mom's word...

430
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,800
should be enough.

431
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,080
Nope,

432
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,080
I need to see it with my own eyes.

433
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
It's too late.

434
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,680
So you're not even confident in that?

435
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,760
Where are you going?

436
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,080
Why does it matter

437
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,720
when they're both adults?

438
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,280
What? Get it fired up!

439
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,560
Go on!

Sis,

444
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,920
have you ever considered
touching some grass?

445
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,000
You and I have different ways to relax.

446
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,480
Maybe you like taking in the view,

447
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
the same way I do with working.

448
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,120
Whatever,

under all that work!

Alright, alright.

For the sake of your relaxation,

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,400
I'll lend you my mobile hotspot.

00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,440
Girl...

557
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,120
Then...

558
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,120
let's make things right.

559
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,880
Ms. Radubdao, please have the honor.

560
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,680
Oh...

561
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,480
This is my old classroom.

562
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,040
Huh!?

563
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,000
What the hell were they so pissed about?

564
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,160
[Rey should just drop dead]

565
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,480
What are you doing?

566
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,720
Thanks.

567
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,680
[Rey is drop-dead gorgeous]

568
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,720
Shit!

569
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,720
Why are you so scared?

570
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,920
The winner of this year's
Glitter Girl is...

571
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,760
Print!

572
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,160
Hold on...

573
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,440
And another winner
of Glitter Girl is...

574
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,920
Rey!

575
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,440
Here.

576
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,760
What is it?

577
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,840
Try this.

578
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,040
Take it.

579
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,080
Come on.

580
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,200
Wait...

581
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
Is it explosive?

582
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,840
Uh-uh.

583
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,640
Are you burning the school down?

584
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,280
Look, I can even draw with it!

585
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,920
Do you enjoy it?

586
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,280
Extremely!

587
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,680
You like it that much?

588
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,880
Have you never played it as a kid?

589
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
For real?

590
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,560
Mm...

591
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,840
Ahem...

592
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,040
As a little girl,
I mastered the violin,

593
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,320
the piano, and golf.

594
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,600
I was away for the auditions

595
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,960
but never tried this kind of stuff.

596
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,360
You...

597
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,320
must have missed a lot of childhood.

598
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,960
Mm...

599
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,640
It actually feels like
turning back time today,

600
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,440
thanks to you.

601
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,360
Seems like the guard is gone.

602
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,520
He probably is...
