Shut up!

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
You've got a crush?!

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
Shush!

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,400
Keep it down!

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,800
Who is it?

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,760
Can you tell me?

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,120
Think of it as a trade.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,040
Swear you won't tell anyone this!

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,120
Alright.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
The person I have a crush on is...

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
Print.

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,520
For real?!

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,280
Have you told her how you feel?

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,000
If I had, I wouldn't be able
to look her in the face.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,760
You really like to overthink, huh?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,640
Maybe...

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,360
she's waiting for you to confess.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,160
What if she isn't?

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm not gonna risk it.

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
Guys, get a big round of applause

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,920
for The Doll Mansion,
whose rating's been through the roof.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,360
Print is now the woman of the hour

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,400
with fans massively
keeping an eye on her love life!

Thank you, guys, for giving love
to The Doll Mansion.

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,240
If you think
the first two episodes are spicy,

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,400
wait until you see the rest!

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
Don't forget to stay tuned!

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
I guarantee you the fun's waiting.

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,880
"Your dress is pretty..."

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,880
[She's already sexy in that dress;
imagine her without one]

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,320
[I wanna see you changing clothes]

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,240
I gotta go now.

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,080
Please give me a follow

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,160
on my real channel
"Print's Payday."

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you for today!

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
You blocked them?

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,840
But those are your fans.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,040
With those kinds of comments,

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
it's gotta be done.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,400
Why would I put up with it?

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
I thought you didn't normally care.

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,440
Well...

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,960
it wasn't as bad before,

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,440
but that was full-on harassment.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,200
What's wrong with
protecting myself from creeps?

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,560
My,

55
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,040
for a second there,
I thought you were jealous.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Who's jealous?

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,040
Don't be such a narcissist!

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Hello!

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,400
Alright, let's go.

60
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
Get ready to stand by.

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Please!

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,960
Uh...

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Fon!

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,600
I don't know if my zipper
went up all the way.

65
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,880
Can you help?

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,560
- Hurry up.
- I'll go first, okay?

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,440
Go.

68
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Move.

69
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Scoot your butt over there.

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,680
Rey, you can lead the way.

71
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,440
I'll follow you.

72
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,680
It's fine. Go on.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
Girl, stay still!

74
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,320
I'll make you admit that you like me.

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Just you wait.

76
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,080
What's up with you?

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm uncomfortable!

78
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,280
Why?

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Did you gain weight?

80
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Is it the dress?

81
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
It's not!

82
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,280
It's the comments
from the livestream earlier!

83
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,520
"She's already sexy in that dress.

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,440
Imagine her without one."

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
"I want to see Print
changing clothes."

86
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,360
Ew, that gives me the ick!

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
Yuck, you're right.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,440
But...

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,360
You've always got
those kinds of comments.

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Why are you affected by them
all of a sudden?

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,080
They just pissed me off!

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,160
Alright, calm down.

93
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,560
If you were that pissed,
didn't you already go off on them?

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
I didn't.

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,840
But I did block them.

96
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,400
You need to threaten them
with a lawsuit.

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,200
Those creeps need to be
taught a lesson!

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,960
Uh-huh...

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,240
Starting from the person I blocked.

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,520
Right.

101
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,400
Can I get your autograph?!

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,600
Can you sign this for me?

103
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,000
Hi, Print!

104
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,080
Please excuse us.

105
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Excuse me.

106
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Let's go, Print.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
How did...

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
they follow us home?

109
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,080
This was the first time
someone followed you home.

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
Worst of all,

111
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,720
they now know you live together.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,680
I don't think Print's house
is safe anymore.

113
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
How about this?

114
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,160
Let the girls stay in a hotel
for the time being.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,920
Hotel reservations
are not hard to track for these people.

116
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
How about...

117
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,840
we let Rey move into my condo?

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,320
I'll take care of her.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,360
I agree with that,

120
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,280
but how could you be sure that creep
hasn't been following you, too,

121
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,000
since everyone knows
you're Print's manager?

122
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,920
If we have her move to my condo,

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,240
but I have to live somewhere else,

124
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,560
where exactly
do you expect me to sleep, Miss?

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,840
You can come to my office.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't mind.

127
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,760
Or you can...

128
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,720
stay over at a hotel.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Whatever floats your boat.

130
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,640
So that means

131
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,880
I have to live in Fon's condo...

132
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
alone?

133
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,160
Thank you for keeping me company.

134
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,880
What choice do I have?

135
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,160
We're in each other's bodies anyway.

136
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,160
If we go our separate ways,

137
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,240
we're gonna be cooked.

138
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,320
Damn it!

139
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Since Mai and Fon
have put you in my care...

140
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
just consider me

141
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,280
your acting manager.

142
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
My manager...

143
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,160
Yes, Miss Manager.

144
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
Since I have something to post today,

145
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,320
could you be my camerawoman?

146
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,520
Please?

147
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,240
Pretty please?

148
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,240
Mm...

149
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,520
Turn that way.

150
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,160
Just go change your top!

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,520
It's too revealing.

152
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
This is all I have with me.

153
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,800
Everything was so sudden

154
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
that I didn't have time to pack.

155
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,400
You can...
find something from Fon's wardrobe.

156
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
I...

157
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,920
I don't like seeing myself
with that much skin.

158
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,320
No matter what I wear, it wouldn't
satisfy the body's owner.

159
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,160
Why don't you just...

160
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,920
pick the outfit for me?

161
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,760
This?

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Not it!

163
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
No.

164
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,920
That's a no!

165
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,280
Hey,

166
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
we've almost gone through her closet
at this point.

167
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,040
Just pick the one you want me to wear.

168
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,280
That one.

169
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
- Which one?
- That one.

170
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,600
- This?
- Mm.

171
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Go change.

172
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,240
I'll...wait outside.

173
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,280
Hold on.

174
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
Pick a pair of pants for me.

175
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Whoa,

176
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,440
you haven't changed a bit.

177
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,520
Always a perfectionist.

178
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Right,

179
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,280
I sent my clothes away for dry-cleaning

180
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,680
- Mm.
- and forgot to grab something with me.

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,120
Can I maybe borrow your PJs?

182
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,640
Of course, just...

183
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,640
look in the closet.

184
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,800
- This closet?
- Mm.

185
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,840
Excuse me, then.

186
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,080
I'll go with this one

187
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,000
since it seems the most comfy.

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,360
Someone...happened to leave it here.

189
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,760
But you can wear it if you want.

190
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,920
I don't think she'll ever
come back for it.

191
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
Forget it.

192
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,240
I don't want to wear
random people's clothes.

193
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
You really haven't changed a bit.

194
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,800
These unmatched pajamas

195
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,840
are from completely different people,

196
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
aren't they?

197
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,840
No need to answer, actually.

198
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
I was just asking.

199
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,800
So this is what's been going on...

200
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,800
Ah-hah...

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,160
I guess this one is finally yours,

202
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,320
so I'll just take it

203
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,880
since I'd hate to sleep
in just some girls' clothes.

204
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Mm.

205
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,800
- Mai.
- Hm?

206
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,960
Your shirt looks pretty good on me,

207
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,960
don't you think?

208
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
Anything else you want?

209
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,120
Actually, a scrunchy would be nice,

210
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,120
or just anything
I can use to put my hair up.

211
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,480
I lost mine.

212
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Try looking in that box over there.

213
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,000
This one?

214
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Mm.

215
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,840
Mai.

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,000
Hm?

217
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
Whose is this?

218
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,240
Your lovers are pretty forgetful
with their stuff, aren't they?

219
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,240
You still have this?

220
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,640
I thought you threw it away.

221
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,920
Your crush...
share the same birthday as mine,

222
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,360
don't they?

223
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,880
Are you alright?

224
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,120
I...

225
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,880
I think you're way too drunk.

226
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Just go home.

227
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,320
I used to think that

228
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
if I hadn't kissed you that day...

229
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
what would have happened between us?

230
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,480
How would you like it to happen?

231
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,120
Just anything...

232
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
other than me getting fired.

233
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,600
But when I really think about it,

234
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm glad that I did it.

235
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen
your true color,

236
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,360
and I would've chased after you
until my death.

237
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,960
Hello?

238
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,120
Have you gone to bed?

239
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Almost.

240
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,040
Don't tell me you're so scared
that you can't sleep?

241
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,080
Who is?

242
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm not scared.

243
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm already in bed,

244
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
and my eyes are getting heavy.

245
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,000
You don't have to be scared.

246
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,840
If that creep followed us
all the way here,

247
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,080
he'd have to go through me first.

248
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Are you...

249
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,600
really not gonna sleep by my side?

250
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,680
Right, the couch
could give you breakouts.

251
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,200
Fon's room is much cleaner
than my house.

252
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,960
Plus...

253
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,880
you're a snorer.

254
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,640
What if I don't get enough sleep?

255
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,880
Mm...

256
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,840
Whatever makes you happy.

257
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,840
Print?

258
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,280
Why are you so quiet?

259
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,840
Shh, hang on a sec.

260
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm reading my fortune.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,240
Ugh, so that's why!

262
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,280
It says I'm facing
some serious misfortunes,

263
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,560
but I don't have to be worried.

264
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,720
After my birthday,

265
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,640
all will be well,

266
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
both for my career and my love life.

267
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,440
And when's your birthday?

268
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,640
The 20th of this month.

269
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,520
So, it means that in 2 weeks...

270
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,120
every hardship will pass.

271
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Wait...

272
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,440
About the birthday
you read the fortune for,

273
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
should it be yours,
since you're the body owner,

274
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,320
or mine, since I'm in your body?

275
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,000
This year's gonna be special.

276
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,680
Let's share our birthdays.

277
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
May wonderful blessings
come to both of our ways.

278
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,680
Rey...

279
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,280
do you want to...

280
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
exchange gifts on our birthdays?

281
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,520
Or maybe we can ask each other
to fulfill a birthday wish

282
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,880
without saying no.

283
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,480
Mm...

284
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,720
Then,

285
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
could I...

286
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,160
ask for my birthday gift in advance?

287
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Shoot it.

288
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm scared...

289
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,080
Could you come sleep with me?

290
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,240
Thank you, Print.

291
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,520
Just tell me what you wish
for your birthday.

292
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,680
Shit! There's a fire!

293
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Wake up!

294
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,360
Rey!

295
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,840
Rey, are you okay?!

296
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,160
You're awake?

297
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
I was just done making breakfast.

298
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,640
What do you think?

299
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
Does it look yummy?

300
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,840
Well, if you told me

301
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,280
this was made by Miss Rey,

302
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,440
I'd give an A for effort...
I guess?

303
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,400
There's no need for the sarcasm.

304
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,640
This is my first time doing this.

305
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,720
I think it's quite lovely.

306
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,920
It is, but...

307
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
If you don't know how to cook,

308
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,120
why didn't you wake me up?

309
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,600
Go sit and wait.

310
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
I'll take care of the rest.

311
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,960
I couldn't make sense
of what Fon has in her fridge.

312
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,880
I'm making this
from whatever you saw in there.

313
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,920
Fon's soy sauce ran out,

314
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,600
so this might be a little bland.

315
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,040
Give it a taste,

316
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,440
and if you don't like it,

317
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,080
you can order takeout.

318
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,440
I'll go pick it up for you.

319
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,480
Okay.

320
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,960
Here, take a bite.

321
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,320
Try it.

322
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
It's not bland,

323
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
quite well-balanced, actually.

324
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,400
Delicious.

325
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Rey,

326
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,160
be careful.

327
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,720
The soup's still hot.

328
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
You can slow down;

329
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,400
I won't fight you for it.

330
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
I'll...pour you some water.

331
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,040
Speaking of which...

332
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,080
You and I

333
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,440
kinda look like newlyweds.

334
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,520
Just kidding!

335
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What is that photo?

336
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,800
Wait.

337
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,440
You still keep the photo from that day?

338
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,560
I didn't mean to keep it...

339
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,440
I just...forgot to throw it away.

340
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,800
- I see...
- Since I realize it now,

341
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,160
I'll throw it away.

342
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,760
Throw it in the bin, then.

343
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,480
Why put it in your pocket?

344
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,840
Right! I'd better ask Fon
to buy some soy sauce!

345
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,200
Is there something else you want?

346
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,560
No.

347
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,760
Didn't you mention
you didn't bring enough clothes?

348
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,240
I'll tell Fon that,

349
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,880
so she can bring tons,

350
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,080
or all, of them to you.
Okay?

351
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,960
Okay!

352
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,080
Fon...

353
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,000
Is this too intentional?

354
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
I accidentally ordered extra food.

355
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
If you're hungry,
you can have it.

356
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,360
I didn't hear you.
What did you say?

357
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,560
- I ordered...
- Oh, you want soy sauce

358
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,560
and some clothes?

359
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,320
Alright, I'll go get them for you.

360
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,040
Maybe around 2 P.M.

361
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,000
They are definitely arguing.

362
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Where are you going?

363
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,640
Grabbing some stuff for Print.

364
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,040
She wants some clothes.

365
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,080
I'll be back. See you.

366
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm coming with you.

367
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Why?

368
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,440
I'll be back before you even know it.

369
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,960
I want to see Rey.

370
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
Chop-chop.

371
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Continue with the phone call.

372
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,680
- I'll throw it away for you.
- Nah!

373
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,520
Aren't you gonna throw it away?

374
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
- You said you were.
- Eat your breakfast.

375
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,880
Aren't you hungry?

376
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,560
- I'll...
- Talk to her; I'll take care of that.

377
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,760
I'll take care of it myself.

378
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,720
Wait...

379
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Is something wrong?

380
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,560
[Where are ya?
Couldn't find you anywhere]

381
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,280
[Keep hiding since you're so good at it]

382
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,480
Does that mean...

383
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,440
they got into your house?

384
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,720
Fon!

385
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,240
What did she want?

386
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Some clothes...

387
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,440
Hey,

388
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
what are you doing?!

389
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,840
- Tell me.
- Uh... Well...

390
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,920
Have you seen my cat?

391
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,360
I'm looking for it.

392
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,600
Let go of her!

393
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,560
Let her go!

394
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,640
Fon!

395
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Are you okay?

396
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Are you hurt?

397
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
They still haven't gotten the culprit,

398
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,560
but I already gave the police
my statement about his "P" tattoo

399
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,000
as you told me.

400
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,520
If we can't catch the bad guy,

401
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,720
will Print and I have to keep on hiding?

402
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,440
I won't let the guy roam around.

403
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,400
I'll do whatever it takes to catch him.

404
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,640
I think...

405
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,520
he sneaked in among the fans

406
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,360
since Print has a lot of fanboys.

407
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
Then...

408
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,400
we have to lure him out.

409
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,280
How are we gonna do that?

410
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
A fan meeting!

411
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,440
If...

412
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,760
If we hold a fan meeting
with a chance to meet Print up close,

413
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,240
he's definitely gonna show up!

414
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,560
But isn't a fan meeting
way too big of an event?

415
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,760
Will we ever find the bad guy?

416
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
You're right...

417
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,360
What if we don't make it a huge event,

418
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,400
but maybe a birthday gathering for her?

419
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,760
How about something like this?

420
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,520
A bit higher.

421
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,800
We're gonna limit the maximum capacity
to 30 people

422
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,160
chosen from the winners
who answer Print's super fan quiz

423
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,760
the fastest and most accurately.

424
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,480
I found the venue

425
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,920
that has enough capacity
and still in the budget.

426
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
Good.

427
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,760
Now, let's assign the work.

428
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,360
Just tell me how I can help.

429
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
You?

430
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,240
Just sit still in this room.

431
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,480
Wait, what?

432
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,400
But I can really help!

433
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,520
I know.

434
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,480
But I don't want you
to be more of a target at the event.

435
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,520
Almost time to begin.

436
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,160
Please be on standby, Miss Print.

437
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,280
Print!

438
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,600
I told you

439
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,560
I'd never leave you alone.

440
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,520
What is that outfit?

441
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,720
Well, it's a disguise.

442
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,520
You look like you could use this.

443
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,400
Uh-uh.

444
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,320
Just try it!

445
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,800
Try it on.

446
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,240
There.

447
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,000
It's now time to start.

448
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,520
Let's welcome...Print!

449
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
Thank you, everyone, for coming!

450
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,360
I'm so grateful for today's fan meeting.

451
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,480
Thank you so much!

452
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,920
I'll start with
my very iconic dance moves.

453
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
Print's Payday,

454
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Pay Up Babies,

455
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,920
The Basket Awaits.

456
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
It's 23.

457
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Alright, guys!
Please give her a round of applause!

458
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,440
Next up is the announcement
of the lucky fans

459
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,400
who'll be receiving the benefit
of a one-on-one photo with Print...

460
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
And! And...

461
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,240
getting to talk to her
in a private room!

462
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,200
Alright,

463
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,600
please allow us
to draw the lucky fan's number.

464
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,240
Right, we got it!

465
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,240
And our lucky fan is...

466
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,440
Number 23!

467
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,800
Where are you, Number 23?!

468
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,560
Please show yourself!

469
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,920
Please step forward!

470
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,360
Oh...

471
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Alright, let's hear it for him!

472
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,880
Could you please take No. 23
to the private room?

473
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,280
Please investigate the suspect for us,
Officer Jin.

474
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,320
Of course.

475
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,680
If there's nothing further,
I'll take the girls home.

476
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,920
I think you should stay

477
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,120
since you're our best bet
to identify the culprit.

478
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,280
Fon, you can stay.

479
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,120
Could you give us a ride home?

480
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,520
Then, can I please
leave them to you, Officer Jin?

481
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,160
My pleasure.

482
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,160
Go.

483
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,400
Well, where's Print?

484
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,760
We ask for permission
to examine.

485
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,160
Hey, what are you doing?!

486
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,840
Is that it, Fon?

487
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,200
It's not...

488
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,200
The tattoo I saw
was just a letter P.

489
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Do you have problems
with the tattoo of my own name?

490
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,600
If it's not him, then who?!

491
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,120
We've searched through
everyone in the event.

492
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,600
And what if that guy
didn't come as a fan?

493
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,720
Apart from the fans,

494
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,720
there are only us and the officers.

495
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,400
Mai, I think we have the wrong guy!

496
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,280
Thank you very much, Officer,
for taking care of us today

497
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,840
and even seeing us home.

498
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,680
It's all good.

499
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,080
It's my job, anyway.

500
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Thank you.

501
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,640
But if you really wanna thank me,

502
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,040
can you excuse us two
for a private moment?

503
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,520
Just Print and me.

504
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,680
I've been looking all day
for my time alone with Print,

505
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,240
and you are the only one

506
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,480
taking that perfect moment
away from me.

507
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,080
It was our plan
to catch the stalker through this event.

508
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,480
He knew every single one
of our movements

509
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,320
because he's one of the officers
who supervised today's event.

510
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,280
Have you come to realize his motive?

511
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,600
Excuse me...

512
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Our main focus now
should be on the victims' mental state.

513
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,720
I guess we're done now.

514
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,760
Let's go.

515
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,400
How are the victims feeling now?

516
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,240
Are they okay?

517
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,040
Ow!

518
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,000
Stay still.

519
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,920
Why did you go all that way?

520
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,600
You're lucky to end up
with a scratch on the elbow.

521
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,040
What if you were stabbed by that knife?

522
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
My bad.

523
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,400
I just couldn't help but act cool.

524
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,040
I ended up...

525
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,320
injuring your body.

526
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,280
Don't you ever think
that I'm genuinely worried about you?

527
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,280
I heard

528
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,120
everything you told Auer.

529
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,760
What thing?

530
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,400
Don't tell me

531
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,920
it was about me

532
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,760
stealing the packed meals home?

533
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,520
It was about you telling Auer

534
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
who you were into.

535
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,360
Um...

536
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,800
I told him that the person I like...

537
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
is...

538
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,080
you.

539
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,200
Rey,

540
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,320
do you remember the birthday wish
we talked about?

541
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,360
Mm.

542
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,240
You've asked one for yours that day...

543
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,280
since it's my birthday today,

544
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,360
can I tell you what I wish for?

545
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,480
Mm, sure.

546
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,480
What do you wish for?

547
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,160
I'm only asking for one thing.

548
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,320
You don't have to feel
the same way about me,

549
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,520
but...

550
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,120
can you not distance yourself from me?

551
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,880
Rey,

552
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,520
can we...

553
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,000
still be friends?

554
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,080
What if...

555
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,600
I don't wanna be friends?

556
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,440
