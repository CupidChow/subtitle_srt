The Doll Mansion 2025!

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,800
Long time no see, Rey.

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
[3 hours earlier]

13
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,440
Rey...

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Rey...

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Print's Payday,

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,360
Pay Up Babies,

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,720
The Basket Awaits!

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,680
I've got these freeze-dried strawberries!

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,440
It's rocking, jaw-dropping, slaying,

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
and out-of-this-world!

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,920
It's so good, guys!

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
I gotta go now

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,000
'cause I've got things lined up next.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,440
Catch you later tonight!

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
Bye-bye!

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,560
Traffic's at a dead stop, Print.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
I don't think...

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,880
we'll make it in time.

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,600
- Fon,
- Hm?

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,480
I think it's time for plan B.

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
Let's run through the blocking again.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,400
- You'll be standing at...
- The venue entrance.

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,240
Then, I'll walk along the red carpet,

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,760
down the stairs to the green mark.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
And be sure to smile to get them hooked.

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,960
Could you please
give her a ride to this place?

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Just make a left turn ahead.

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,440
Whoa,

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
I would,

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
but I don't know how to get there.

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
I can ride.

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,640
Um...

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,880
I'll give you 300 baht!

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,120
Please?

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
Alright. Come on.

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,040
- Brace yourself!
- Mm!

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,160
The Doll Mansion 2025!

48
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,320
For the record,
you're not the only one dying to find out

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,440
who'll take on the roles in this remake.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,000
Even our lead actors don't know
who each other are!

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,760
We're all in for a big surprise tonight!

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,600
Let's hear it for our male lead!

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,280
Best Male Actor,

54
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,960
Auer!

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,720
Here comes a double dose of star power
that'll surprise every fan!

56
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,200
It's time to reveal the faces
of these two exceptional talents.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,880
Let's start the countdown
to a moment that will make history.

58
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Five...

59
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,040
Four...

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,160
Three...

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,240
Two...

62
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
One!

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,680
Please take off your masks.

64
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Long time no see, Rey.

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,120
Mm.

66
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,400
Rey, the rising star of the era.

67
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,760
Squeeze together, please.

68
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,720
And Print, the hottest influencer

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,240
making her acting debut.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
One more, please.

71
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
Smile please.

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,360
Oh!

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,480
- Oh!
- Whoa!

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,120
Ah!

75
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,640
Oh!

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,360
Oh!

77
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
Are they okay?

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,520
Get off.

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,880
What's happening?!

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
I can't.
The bracelet's snagged on my dress.

81
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,080
There are lots of people.

82
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,000
- Get off of me
- I'm trying.

83
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
Don't you see I'm trying?

84
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,840
Stop moving.

85
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,360
Hurry!

86
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
- There are too many people!
- I'm trying now!

87
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,360
How about I leave it be?

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
Let's stay stuck like this.

89
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Are the female leads beefing?

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
It looks that way!

91
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,960
Get the mics closer to them!

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Um...

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Here's a sample of the excitement

94
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,640
that awaits in The Doll Mansion 2025,

95
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,880
coming soon exclusively on WeTV.

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,440
Right!

97
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,640
We were shocked!

98
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,320
- Can we take a photo of you guys?
- That was one shocking moment!

99
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,200
Give each other a hug, please.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,880
Can you please look at each other?

101
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,480
Squeeze together, please.

102
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,840
On the stage?

103
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
Oh, Rey and I don't have any beef!

104
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,280
We've known each other
since we were this little.

105
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,360
It's been like 10 years.

106
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,040
Don't forget to follow me
on my real channel.

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
Print's Payday,

108
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,600
Pay Up Babies,

109
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,160
The Basket Awaits!

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,560
Bye-bye!

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,920
What's up, Fon?

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,280
I'm about to call you.

113
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,720
Did you drop Mom and Patty off
at the bus terminal?

114
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Yeah.

115
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,760
They made it in time for the last bus.

116
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,600
They'll probably get to Chanthaburi
around 5 A.M.

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,720
Thank you, sis!

118
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
Thank you so much! Kiss, kiss!

119
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,240
Print,

120
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,080
there's a workshop tomorrow morning.

121
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,240
The director asked me
to schedule that session.

122
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,840
That means...

123
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll have to see that girl again.

124
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Reminder: New House Payment for August

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,560
[House Contractor] Confirm the new house blueprint for me

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,760
Hey, Frank.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Have you looked up
the new house plan for me?

128
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm sorry, sis.

129
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,880
I've been really busy
looking for an internship.

130
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
I haven't had time for that.

131
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,840
No worries.

132
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
I really didn't forget, though!

133
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,760
Here, I'll help you look for it now.

134
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
It's fine.

135
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll handle it.

136
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,120
What about you?

137
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,960
You haven't eaten.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,520
Saifon even got you the meal.

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
I wanna go on a diet today.

140
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,880
Lose some weight.

141
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
Hang in there!

142
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,440
My sister is the best!

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
You're stinky!

144
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Go take a shower.

145
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
Go on.

146
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,640
Alright.

147
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Keep at it!

148
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,600
If I'm not rich now,

149
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,400
when will I ever be?

150
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,240
Please be at ease.

151
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,920
Surprise!

152
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,840
Here you are, my rising star!

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,040
Can you believe it?

154
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,520
The moment I invited my friends

155
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,280
to celebrate my daughter's main role
in The Doll Mansion,

156
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
they all rushed right in!

157
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,200
Congratulations to you, little Rey.

158
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,560
That's Miss Wimol

159
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
from Jo Malene, the perfume brand.

160
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,360
Next to her is Miss Pear,

161
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,880
the wife of the CEO of Thai Star Airways.

162
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,320
Now that we are gathered
to celebrate your new project,

163
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,440
I think it would be appropriate
to introduce you to my friends,

164
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,000
as there may be opportunities for us
to collaborate in the future.

165
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,840
Kindly make yourself comfortable.

166
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,640
Certainly.

167
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,160
Go speak with them to be polite,

168
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
then go upstairs to rest.

169
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,920
You have a workshop
tomorrow morning, right?

170
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,160
A workshop?

171
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,240
If I remember correctly,

172
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,520
the workshop is next week, isn't it?

173
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,000
I wish that were so,

174
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,120
if it weren't for that incident on stage.

175
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,720
Was it that girl

176
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,000
who caused you to misstep?

177
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,120
Be more mindful, Rey.

178
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,320
I don't want a repeat
of what happened that day.

179
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
Of course, Mother.

180
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
Come on.

181
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
Uh, Mrs. Duen?

182
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,320
Could I speak with you briefly?

183
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,520
We are placing an order for the diamond
from the newest collection.

184
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,600
Is that so?

185
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,240
Go on.

186
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,720
Please go and greet them.

187
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,280
- Can I see?
- Please.

188
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Take a look.
Such beautiful clarity.

189
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,000
Wow!

190
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,280
That's a reasonable price, too!

191
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
We'll have to compete for it.

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,360
Indeed.

193
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,120
How gorgeous!

194
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,280
There's only one in the world!

195
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
I wasn't gonna tell anyone at first

196
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,720
but he...

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Rey,

198
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
don't take your mom's words
too seriously.

199
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,080
Aren't you supposed to be playing golf
with your friends?

200
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,800
I can do that whenever I want.

201
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,360
How can I miss your celebration?

202
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,360
Here.

203
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
What is that?

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Congrats, dear.

205
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,760
I asked your grandfather for this.

206
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,600
You don't have to do that.

207
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
I've got my driver.

208
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,960
I don't think I'll drive the sports car.

209
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,960
There.

210
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,640
That's what I thought you'd say.

211
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,760
In that case,

212
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
may I borrow it
for meetings with my clients?

213
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,200
Just tell me if you want it back.

214
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,960
Alright?

215
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,200
Definitely.

216
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,760
I need to take this call.

217
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,800
Let's go!

218
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,680
Where is it?

219
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,720
Let's go.

220
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,600
Print, just make your way in.

221
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,600
I have to reply to this email.

222
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,720
Oh.

223
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,960
By the way,

224
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,920
you look like you're taking your kid
to her first day of school.

225
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,560
Hi, Mommy.

226
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,960
Stay focused at school, my sweet Print!

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
Don't make me regret.

228
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,680
- Now go!
- Alright.

229
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Mind your step.

230
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,600
- See ya!
- Yeah.

231
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,280
Okay.

232
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,640
You look great,

233
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,120
as always.

234
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,520
And you're late, as always.

235
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
Why?

236
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,120
Are you gonna punish me?

237
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,680
Don't forget you're not my boss anymore.

238
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Miss!

239
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,480
Oh!

240
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
- Hello, Miss Mangosteen.
- Hi, there.

241
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,840
- I'm Wanmai.
- Right.

242
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,920
This is a gift from Mrs. Duen.

243
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,080
Goodness!

244
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,360
Please tell her I appreciate it.

245
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,360
Or how about this?

246
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,960
Tell her I'd love to meet for dinner
whenever she has time.

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,920
Of course, I'll pass the message along.

248
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,800
Shoot.

249
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,280
How do you know what I want?

250
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I did some research.

251
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,680
Oh my, how attentive!

252
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,680
Thank you.
Please take care of her today.

253
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
- My pleasure!
- Please.

254
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,880
Hello, Miss Mangosteen!

255
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,600
Here's a little gift.

256
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,640
Please take care of Print!

257
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,000
- Print!
- Oh, right!

258
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,480
Oh my, I'm late.

259
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,240
- See you again, Miss!
- Sure.

260
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,080
You're also close friends with her?

261
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,680
Well,

262
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,280
of course!

263
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,520
What's wrong with that?

264
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,840
Is it illegal or something?

265
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,000
You think you're the only one
she's close to?

266
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,920
If you're her close friend,

267
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,400
you should've known

268
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,480
that she dislikes fruits.

269
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,240
Hey,

270
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
about yesterday,

271
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,880
are you still mad at me?

272
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm not.

273
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,600
I just don't like mistakes.

274
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,120
Hello, girls!

275
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
- Hi!
- Hello.

276
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
Do you guys know

277
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,560
why I have to open
this new session for you?

278
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,520
Let me tell you something.

279
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,440
Acting isn't something you do alone,

280
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,800
and it's not just about
playing your part.

281
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,480
There's a lot more to that.

282
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,080
You need vision.

283
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,880
You need to see it through!

284
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,840
You need to listen closely!

285
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,120
That's what triggers the emotions!

286
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
Otherwise,

287
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,040
it's like you're talking to...

288
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
a wall.

289
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040
You get it?

290
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,480
I do.

291
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,200
Alright, I have an exercise

292
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,440
for both of you to try.

293
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,080
It's called mirror acting.

294
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,080
You'll imitate each other's poses

295
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,640
to learn each other's rhythm.

296
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,560
Take turns to lead and follow.

297
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
Take turns being
the follower and the leader.

298
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
Get it?

299
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
If you do,

300
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,320
close your eyes.

301
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,640
Take a deep breath,
and stay focused.

302
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,760
When you're ready...

303
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,680
Start!

304
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,840
Try to catch me.

305
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,360
Rey!

306
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,560
Stay focused.

307
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,120
- Okay?
- Yes.

308
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,160
Oh my!

309
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,200
Alright, that's enough.

310
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,400
Rey, your turn to lead.

311
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,160
- Yes.
- You might not understand the exercise.

312
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,520
Don't forget to stay more focused.

313
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,080
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's start over.

314
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
Close your eyes.

315
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,640
Inhale and exhale.

316
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
Stay present and focused.

317
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,720
Ready?

318
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,640
Go!

319
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,160
Keep an eye on the details.

320
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,560
Keep calm...

321
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,800
Slowly...

322
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,800
Imagine a rope

323
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,240
stretched between both of you.

324
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,840
That's right.

325
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,840
Yeah, just like that.

326
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,080
Slowly but surely.

327
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,240
Look into each other's eyes.

328
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,200
Communicate through your eyes.

329
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
There!

330
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,840
Goodness!

331
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,840
Are you okay?

333
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,640
Are you ever gonna stop playing?

334
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,560
I wasn't playing.

335
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
It was an accident.

336
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
That's enough!

337
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
Both of you!

338
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,600
You are all distracted.

339
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,160
If this is how you're gonna be,

340
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,440
then we're done for today.

341
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,280
Miss, but...

342
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,440
[Mother: Miss Mangosteen called me
Is there a problem, Rey?]

343
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,360
[Mother: Focus on the workshop
I trust you to do it well]

344
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,960
Excuse me,

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,840
do you have any pads?

346
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,920
Thank you.

347
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Ma'am.

348
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you!

349
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,840
I'll return one to you.

350
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,320
What?

351
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,080
We were nice to each other a second ago.

352
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,160
I wouldn't be if I had known it was you.

353
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Really?

354
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,040
That serious?

355
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,920
You're acting bougie!

356
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Hey,

357
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,880
I was fooling around too much today.

358
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,640
I'll be more focused next time.

359
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,200
You can be as chill as you want.

360
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,640
Just one thing.

361
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,520
Don't drag me down with you.

362
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,360
Hey!

363
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,720
You wanna talk about chill?

364
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,320
Says the girl
who does Pilates in the morning

365
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,520
and ends her afternoon with brunch!

366
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,440
Wait, where did she go?

367
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,080
Who's that?

368
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,480
Hello,

369
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,760
the Moon and the Star!

370
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,160
Did we enter the wrong room?

371
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
You didn't!

372
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,560
I've been watching your little fights
for a long time now.

373
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,160
Those are such a headache.

374
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I hope you both...

375
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,240
become so close

376
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,400
that you feel like the same person.

377
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,720
Is this some kind of candid camera prank?

378
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
What?

379
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,320
Are you scared?

380
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm not.

381
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,800
I just think this is one of
Miss Mangosteen's setups.

382
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,080
Alright.

383
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,680
Let's start our intensive session.

384
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,240
Could you two hold hands
and step into this magic circle?

385
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
Come on!

386
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,480
Don't be afraid.

387
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,280
Come on!

388
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,480
Now, look into each other's eyes.

389
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,480
Thereafter,

390
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,920
hold each other's hands.

391
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,960
Think about what each of you
carries on her shoulders.

392
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,200
Let them connect.

393
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,520
Conflicted souls,

394
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,040
become one, and behold.

395
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,800
You are me,

396
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
I am you.

397
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,720
You are me,

398
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,120
I am you.

399
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,320
You are me,

400
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,760
I am you!

401
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,800
You are me,

402
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,880
I am you!

403
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,360
From this moment forth,

404
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,600
your souls are bound together as one.

405
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,840
Am I going crazy?

406
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,240
Are you...

407
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,960
really in my body?

408
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,400
Print?

409
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,040
Are you really in my body?

410
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,520
Rey?

411
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,640
Damn!

412
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,280
This is the first time
I've seen my whole body!

413
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,800
I look so hot!

414
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,320
Does it mean...

415
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,880
we've switched bodies?

416
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,320
Just like in the movies!

417
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,400
Is this really the time to be thrilled?

418
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,280
We need to figure out

419
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,760
what caused us to switch bodies

420
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,080
I remember nothing.

421
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,800
We need to go find
the Mysterious Person now.

422
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,920
Hey!

423
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
"Temporarily closed: away on an outing."

424
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Does that mean
I'll be stuck in your body for a while?

425
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,040
Cannot!

426
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,920
Do you have a credit card?

427
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,200
Why do you need it?

428
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
Do you think this is a crime movie
or something?

429
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,600
But if we're gonna do
the ritual ourselves,

430
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,200
who's gonna be the ritualist?

431
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
That'd be you.

432
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,000
You're a drama queen.

433
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,040
I'll pass.

434
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Maybe you should be.

435
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,560
Yesterday in the bathroom,

436
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,280
you were really good at doing voices.

437
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,400
I was still in my body at the time.

438
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,320
Alright, I'll do it.

439
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,360
Conflicted souls,

440
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
become one, and behold.

441
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,520
You are me,

442
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,200
I am you!

443
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,000
You are me,

444
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,640
I am you!

445
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,120
I've seen tons of body-swap movies.

446
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,880
Should we try their methods?

447
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,560
What methods?

448
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,720
Have you seen that movie
starring Mai Davika?

449
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,720
She took a photo and then swapped bodies?

450
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,800
She reverted to her younger self
in that movie.

451
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,480
This is the last time
I will ever believe you.

452
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,120
If people switched bodies by drowning
like in the novels,

453
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
then let's get diving!

454
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,200
Just do it!

455
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Rey!

456
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Rey!

457
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Rey.

458
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Rey!

459
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Rey!

460
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,360
Wake up, Rey!

461
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Rey!

462
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,560
What do I do?

463
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,520
One, two, three,

464
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,680
four, five, six,

465
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,000
seven, eight, nine, ten...

466
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Rey!

467
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,200
What should I do?

468
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,280
Why didn't you tell me
you couldn't swim?!

469
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,320
Who asked you to drag me into the pool?

470
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
Excuse you,

471
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
this is my body,

472
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,680
and I didn't make a fuss about it.

473
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,120
How unfortunate it is

474
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,840
to be stuck in this body.

475
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,680
Do you think
I wanna be stuck in your body?

476
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm so short now!

477
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,640
Teeny-tiny body.

478
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,840
Then just go our separate ways

479
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,360
in each other's body!

480
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,000
Where are you?

481
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,480
I need to pick you up
for the La Lune launch event tonight.

482
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,360
Print, where are you?

483
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I brought the mineral water
you need to review,

484
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,920
but you're not home.

485
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,920
Wanmai,

486
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,840
we really can't cancel the event today?

487
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Rey, are you alright?

488
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
You feeling sick?

489
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
No.

490
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,160
I'm just...

491
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,440
I have to take this call.

492
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,600
Go ahead and go inside.

493
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,960
- Hey, wait!
- Hello?

494
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,800
You got this, diva!

495
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,320
On the occasion of the launch of
La Lune's latest jewelry collection,

496
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,240
it is my honor to present to you
our esteemed brand ambassador,

497
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,560
Rey!

498
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,880
As the brand ambassador of La Lune,

499
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,960
in what ways do you think
this collection reflects you?

500
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,680
The placement of the diamonds
in a floral motif

501
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,680
reflects my profession as an actress,

502
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,200
where the ability to portray
a range of characters is essential.

503
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,400
You may think this has been easy.

504
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,520
In truth, I, Rey,
have devoted my time and efforts

505
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,480
with equal passion to La Lune,

506
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,040
who has meticulously crafted
this collection

507
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,920
into an unrivaled, exquisite,

508
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,760
and unforgettable masterpiece.

509
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,920
We can all agree that her beauty
and charm truly reflect our jewelry.

510
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,760
And tonight, she will grace us
with a special performance

511
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,080
that embodies our unique charm

512
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,160
and creates a lasting memory.

513
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,120
Hello, Saifon.

514
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,400
Print, why haven't you started
live streaming yet?

515
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,080
Is there a problem
with your Internet connection?

516
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,120
It's not that. I can't find the briefing.

517
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,360
What? If you can't find it,
you'd better check your email.

518
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,760
You won't let me live in peace, will you?

519
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,720
Today, I'm not only here
to sell mineral water,

520
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,040
but also to give away these model cars!

521
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,160
This is my way of thanking you all
for your continued support.

522
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,240
Mr. SunnyDay, you've won this one.

523
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,720
Ms. PinnyPop, this one is for you.

524
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,400
This one goes to Miss Orange.

525
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,760
We've got our lucky winners
for all the giveaways.

526
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,760
They'll be right at your door soon!

527
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,280
Thank you, everyone.

528
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,160
Bye-bye!

529
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,000
Sis, let's have dinner!

530
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,480
We are...

531
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,080
siblings… right?

532
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,720
What kind of question is that?

533
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,600
You lost your memories or something?

534
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,200
Wait, where are my cars?!

535
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,120
Uh, um...

536
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,920
Where are my model cars?!

537
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,680
The cars are yours?

538
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,960
Uh...

539
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,320
I sold them.

540
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,440
Don't tell me you sold them off
to pay for the new house?

541
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,320
That's right!

542
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,760
I really needed the money.

543
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,760
Don't you know

544
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,240
how much they mean to me?

545
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,400
They're all gone!

546
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Frank...

547
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,440
I'm...

548
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,560
I'm sorry.

549
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,320
I'll buy you the new ones.

550
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm really sorry.

551
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,760
Mai,

552
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,360
I don't think it was that bad.

553
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,200
I'm even trending now!

554
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,000
'Rey, The Dancing Queen.'

555
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,000
Good evening, Miss Duen.

556
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,960
Good evening, Mom!

557
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
It's 'Mother.'

558
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,000
What?

559
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,840
'Mother.'

560
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,080
I'm sorry, Mother.

561
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,760
I never knew
you were this good at dancing.

562
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,280
But that's not what we agreed on.

563
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,480
Didn't Wanmai tell you
what you were supposed to do there?

564
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,520
She did.

565
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,880
Why didn't you keep that?

566
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,360
Or don't you trust my decision?

567
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,240
That's not it.

568
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,640
I just wanted to try something new.

569
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,120
La Lune reached out to me

570
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,840
and said they would be holding off
on next year's brand ambassador contract.

571
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,080
Mai, handle this for me.

572
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,200
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,160
You didn't do anything wrong.

574
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,280
I'll just have to find you new clients.

575
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,280
Go take a bath and rest.

576
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,040
I need to go over
some business with Wanmai.

577
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Alright.

578
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,520
It was my failure
to communicate with her.

579
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,280
I'll take full responsibility.

580
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,600
Tomorrow, I'll go talk to the client
at their office.

581
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,160
Do not let this happen again.

582
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,320
I don't want to get Rey a new manager.

583
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,720
There you are.

584
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,640
You wanted to see me

585
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,560
because of what happened
at the event?

586
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,520
I'm sorry for last night.

587
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,680
I didn't think it would be as bad
as putting the contract on hold.

588
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,080
That's fine.

589
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,440
I wasn't into that brand anyway.

590
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,400
I'm not really a violin girl.

591
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,680
Only if it were the guitar...

592
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,720
I'm sorry.

593
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,280
I thought...

594
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,560
the model cars were yours.

595
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,440
So, I wanted to get back at you.

596
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,000
What are you saying?

597
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,360
I...

598
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,640
gave away all your brother's model cars.

599
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,520
Huh?!

600
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,440
Print...

601
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,760
Shall we try jumping into the pool again?

602
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,360
I don't want to live
in your body anymore.

603
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,520
Let's do it.

604
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,080
There's no point.

605
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,960
Aren't you...

606
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,920
mad at me?

607
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,680
I am!

608
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
If you want to make it up to me,

609
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,680
you need to keep up with me for a day.
