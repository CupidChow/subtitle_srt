Rey!

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
Print!

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,480
We...

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,040
switched back?!

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,080
Please give a round of applause
to Miss Print and Miss Rey

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
for their exclusive show!

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,120
Hey!

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,640
Print, you okay?

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,360
Rey?

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,960
Mai, I...

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,240
She's not Rey.

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,680
Don't tell me that you guys...

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,640
Switched back?

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,440
Rey.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Mother!

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,560
I miss you so much.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,000
We just met last night, didn't we?

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
Come home with me today, then.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,440
I have some updates for you.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,400
I got a call from a Chinese agency.

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,520
With one condition:

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,280
you need to cancel
all your work in Thailand.

30
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,960
What about the project
I just took on with Print?

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,840
I'd better schedule a meeting
between you and the agency.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,280
That way you'll know
it's truly for the best.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Rey!

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,080
Uh...

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm going home.

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
Let's go home.

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,960
I'll be waiting in the car, Miss.

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,960
Do you like these flowers?

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,160
Thank you.

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,040
Is there good news
you haven't told me?

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm just happy
the event today went smoothly.

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,360
Speaking of which,
what news do you have for me?

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
I've scheduled a meeting
with the Chinese agency.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,800
They'll be flying here
to have a talk with you soon.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,920
The Chinese agency?

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,720
The one we discussed last night, dear.

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
Hello, my beloved brother, Frank.

48
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Hey, are Mom and Patty with you?

49
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,840
Come on, turn on the camera.

50
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
- Patty.
- Hm?

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,920
Frank, why would you turn it on?

52
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,040
I told him to.

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,120
I want to see your lovely faces.

54
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
That's odd of you.

55
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,200
Is there something going on?

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,400
I just really miss you guys

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
and Thai barbeque!

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,640
Since Jake's flying here
the day after tomorrow,

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
should we eat Thai barbeque again?

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,240
Jake?

61
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,240
Jake who?

62
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,480
What's the matter with her?

63
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm sorry

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,520
I haven't told you this from the start.

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm afraid you'd be worried.

66
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,680
Why would I be?

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,560
It's your happiness, after all.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
I'll take you to meet him sometime.

69
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,080
This is not how yesterday went.

70
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,800
Didn't we
already talk to her about this?

71
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,560
Is there anything
you haven't told me, Rey?

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,520
Is there anything

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,760
you haven't told me, Print?

74
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
About the Chinese agency,

75
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
why did you decide on your own

76
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
without even asking me?

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,720
It's your future, Rey.

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,560
How could I even say no?

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
You don't even have to.

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,240
All it took was to discuss it with me,

81
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,760
and let me be the one
making the decision.

82
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,000
Is that so hard?

83
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,840
This is my life.

84
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Rey, you didn't tell me
about my mom either!

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
That's my family.

86
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,400
I've been trying to find
the right time to do so!

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,080
It's not the end of the world

88
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,120
if your mom has a new boyfriend!

89
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
It might be nothing to you, Rey,

90
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,960
but not for me.

91
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,560
That's my mom we're talking about.

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,600
She's not a child!

93
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,760
She knows what she's doing!

94
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
If she's found real love,

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,880
shouldn't you be happy for her?

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,400
What if it's not real love, Rey?

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,600
What if her heart is broken again?

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,280
You'd never understand

99
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,880
how I have to be
the main pillar of the house,

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,480
carrying everything on my shoulders.

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,920
You could never imagine
how guilty I'd feel

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,560
seeing my family heartbroken!

103
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,480
But do you have any clue

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,720
how uncomfortable
everyone in your family is

105
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,680
because of
your so-called good intentions?

106
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
All this time,

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,800
you must've really been
uncomfortable with me.

108
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,040
I heard that loud and clear.

109
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,800
I believe I saw you
driving off somewhere last night.

110
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,400
I have some business to take care of.

111
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,800
Try not to get sick during this time.

112
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Mother,

113
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm...not so sure
about the Chinese agency.

114
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,480
Have my decisions
ever wronged you, dear?

115
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Print!

116
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,320
Come talk this out with me now!

117
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Print!

118
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Print!

119
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,360
Print?

120
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Print!

121
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,520
Rey, don't get any closer,

122
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,240
or you'll catch a cold.

123
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,520
You have the energy
to worry about others now?

124
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,360
Whoa, you're burning up.

125
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,480
It's cold!

126
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Just bear with it.

127
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,760
This will cool you down.

128
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,760
Isn't this too soon?

129
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Why?

130
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,720
I'm a grown woman.
I can do whatever I want.

131
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
I'm not gonna
dance around it like kids do.

132
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Plus, I don't think
you'd invite me here for dinner

133
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
without making me your dessert.

134
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,600
What kind of person am I in your eyes?

135
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,960
It's a genuine dinner.

136
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
Nothing else?

137
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,000
Mm-hm,

138
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,640
I have something important to discuss.

139
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,400
- Mai...
- Hm?

140
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,320
You don't have to do all this.

141
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,160
It's just a dinner date at home.

142
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,040
You made it feel like
a fine dining restaurant...

143
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,760
This is how I normally do it.

144
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,240
I'll dig right in, then!

145
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,360
Yum!

146
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,760
What's with the staring?

147
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,760
I just wanna know how you feel

148
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,520
dining with a disciplinarian like me.

149
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,880
I'm not uncomfortable or anything.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Just don't complain if I make a mess.

151
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,680
What if it's not just dining together?

152
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
If you woke up
to the sight of me every day,

153
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
what would you say?

154
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,960
Are you asking me to move in with you?

155
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,560
Whoa, isn't it...

156
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,240
too soon?

157
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,280
It's your own words,

158
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,120
"I'm a grown woman.
I can do whatever I want.

159
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm not gonna
dance around it like kids do."

160
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Well,

161
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,400
if a disciplinarian like you

162
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,960
sees me spilling water
all over the table every day,

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,360
can you handle it?

164
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
One more kiss, please?

165
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,960
I didn't even know you cared.

166
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
I thought you were uncomfortable.

167
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,720
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,400
I never once feel
uncomfortable around you.

169
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,640
Could we please make up?

170
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,160
"Babe."

171
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,440
I feel really bad.

172
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,280
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Babe?

174
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,760
So you're not gonna drop it?

175
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,760
Okay,

176
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,840
I guess I'm leaving.

177
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,400
Ah, wait a minute!

178
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,200
I really am!

180
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm really, really sorry!

181
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
I'm sorry, babe.

182
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,720
I'm sorry!

183
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
What are you doing?

184
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,560
I'm making it up to you, Rey.

185
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Don't you like it?

186
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,800
I suppose your fever's gone now.

187
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Well, I've got a good nurse

188
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,160
scaring the fever away.

189
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,800
Now that we've switched back,

190
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,480
why don't you
take good care of yourself

191
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,520
like you did in my body?

192
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
Be mindful of your health,

193
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,200
and don't ever get sick again.

194
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Do you hear me?

195
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
I do!

196
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,640
But I'm not saying

197
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,040
that I'll only take good care of myself

198
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,640
because I...

199
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,520
will also take good care of you.

200
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,240
It's nice that we switched back.

201
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,120
I get to adore your face this closely.

202
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,080
Do you remember how I told you

203
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,960
I was jealous of your beauty?

204
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,600
I no longer feel that way.

205
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,640
I've come to really like it.

206
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,240
Your eyebrows...

207
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Your eyes...

208
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Your nose...

209
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,520
And your lips.

210
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,120
I love everything

211
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,440
you said you didn't like about yourself.

212
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,440
Look who's burning up now.

213
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Are you teasing me?

214
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,480
You'll regret it!

215
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,480
Waking up to you in my arms

216
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
is a hundred times better
than waking up alone.

217
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,920
Then...

218
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,920
don't get mad at me again, Print.

219
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,640
Mm.

220
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,240
Could we promise

221
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,400
we'd never fight like we did again?

222
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,760
Mm, I promise.

223
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,200
I won't keep
any more secrets from you,

224
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,520
and I won't ever
run away from problems again.

225
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
Sis, are you really not gonna meet him?

226
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
I think...

227
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,000
you should go meet him for a bit.

228
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,560
No way.

229
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,920
If I do,

230
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,000
it's gonna be such a pain.

231
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,840
Ow!

232
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,720
That hurts!

233
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
You just promised a second ago

234
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,560
you wouldn't run away
from problems.

235
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,880
You said it yourself

236
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,960
I should be happy for her new love.

237
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,680
But I just...

238
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,560
couldn't be happy

239
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,480
that someone's gonna replace Dad.

240
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,120
If he really was an awful man,

241
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,040
would you just let him get away with it?

242
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,680
Nuh-uh! No way!

243
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Not in a million years I'd let him live.

244
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,840
I appreciate you coming, Print.

245
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,520
Where's the guy?

246
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,400
Your foreign boyfriend?

247
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,080
Did he know I was coming,

248
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,000
so he cried back to his home country?

249
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Good thing Jake didn't fall over.

250
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,080
Why didn't you help him, Frank?!

251
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,480
Uh...

252
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
Print, this is Jake.

253
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,840
Hello, my name is Jake.

254
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Thank you.

255
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,400
Mom,

256
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,560
where is he from, anyway?

257
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,040
How did you meet him?

258
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Oh,

259
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,240
I met Jake
when he traveled here three years ago.

260
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,520
He worked in the States,

261
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,680
but he's now retired.

262
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,640
Oh!

263
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,120
I...will get a new pair myself.

264
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,280
Retired?

265
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,280
How would he take care
of his living expenses?

266
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,520
Don't tell me
he's gonna be asking you for money.

267
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,720
He has his own savings, sweetie.

268
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,760
Plus, he wants to move here.

269
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,280
"That's right,

270
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,720
because I wish to be close to Rapee."

271
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,120
"I want to take care of Rapee."

272
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,880
I guess
all your worries are gone by now.

273
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,640
Someone's taking care of your mom.

274
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,800
Sorry! Sorry...

275
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,600
I will take care of this!

276
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,600
Don't worry.

277
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,000
Don't worry.

278
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,160
Look at him.

279
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,240
Can't even take care of himself.

280
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,520
I'm guessing the person
who changed her mind

281
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,960
is you, isn't it?

282
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,200
Why do you think so?

283
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Well, Print is the kind
who never changes her mind,

284
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,680
except when someone talks her out of it.

285
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Gossiping about me?

286
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,040
Nope, never.

287
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,320
- Right, Patty?
- Mm! Who'd do that?

288
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,680
Frank, Patty, just go.

289
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,520
Mom's calling you guys
from the outside.

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,320
I'll take care of this.

291
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
That's awesome, Sis.

292
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,960
I was just starting to feel a cramp.

293
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,320
Let's go, Patty.

294
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Shoo!

295
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,760
After we wipe all these dishes,

296
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,040
let's go home.

297
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
Already?

298
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,360
But you've only been here
for a few hours.

299
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,040
Long enough to know he's tacky!

300
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,520
He looks like a good-for-nothing.

301
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,600
How could I trust my family with him?

302
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,800
Print,

303
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,720
are you sure that is enough

304
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,880
to judge his worth for your mom?

305
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Hm...

306
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,600
Look at us.

307
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,200
We've known each other for years,

308
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,200
but it took a long time for us

309
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
to really get to know each other.

310
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,560
Everyone,

311
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,480
Print cut up some fruit for you.

312
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Thanks, dear.

313
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
I did cut some for Jake.

314
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,440
Where is he?

315
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,280
He's probably over there.

316
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,680
Grab him for me, would you?

317
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,080
Okay.

318
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,440
- Here, take a seat.
- Let's eat.

319
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,480
- Eat with us.
- Thank you.

320
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,760
Here, Rey.

321
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,800
Hey!

322
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,280
What are you doing
with my dad's motorbike?

323
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,400
Uh...

324
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,840
I just thought
it's probably out of order...

325
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,680
You don't have any rights
to touch things around my house!

326
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,760
Print!

327
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,760
What's wrong?

328
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,800
Ask your boyfriend

329
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,600
who he thinks he is,

330
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,200
messing with Dad's stuff.

331
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,480
Do you know how important
that motorbike is to me, Rey?

332
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,360
Dad saved up money for it

333
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,000
to take us to school,

334
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,440
take us to different places,

335
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,680
and bring us to camp.

336
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,280
Nowadays,

337
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,320
whenever I ride
that motorbike to places,

338
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,480
I feel as though Dad accompanies me,

339
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,880
as if he's still right next to me.

340
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,760
I don't get a damn thing.

341
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,360
Why does Mom
feel the need to replace Dad?

342
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
No one could ever replace anybody.

343
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,080
I don't like this at all!

344
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,560
I believe

345
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,440
Auntie, Jake, and your siblings

346
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,600
are also on the same page.

347
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,240
Auntie once told me

348
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,960
she still missed your dad every day,

349
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,120
so she came to this place

350
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,000
where she met Jake.

351
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
He was here when she did

352
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,760
because he missed his late wife.

353
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,880
He and his spouse
promised they'd take a trip here,

354
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,680
but they never made it together.

355
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,640
You're saying that...

356
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Jake also lost his wife?

357
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,080
Mm.

358
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,720
Do you know

359
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,360
what two people
who can't forget their lost lovers do?

360
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,800
They share those memories
with each other,

361
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
instead of letting them fade away.

362
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,680
Rey, do you think Jake can comfort her?

363
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm not saying that.

364
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,560
I think you should see it for yourself.

365
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
All done!

366
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,280
Jake!

367
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,600
Oh, you're back?

368
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,760
Just in time, I fixed the motorbike.

369
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,520
Didn't you disassemble it?

370
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,200
I was trying to fix it up,

371
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
but seeing how old it is,

372
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,320
I took it apart to get a better look.

373
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,960
Have you two eaten anything?

374
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,400
Not yet, Auntie.

375
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,480
Okay, then, let's eat.

376
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,120
- Mm!
- Come on, honey.

377
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Let's go eat.

378
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,400
I'm getting hungry.

379
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,480
Come on.

380
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Here you go!

381
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,680
It's absolutely delicious, Auntie!

382
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,360
Print!

383
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm not gonna save any for you.

384
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,960
Fine.

385
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
How is it?

386
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,480
Is it as good as you remember?

387
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,400
Mm, it's heavenly.

388
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Jake even helped me out in the kitchen.

389
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Print...

390
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,120
Jake,

391
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,840
do you really love my mom?

392
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,840
Say it in front of Dad

393
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,280
because if you dare to lie,

394
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,760
I'll have Dad haunt you

395
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,960
back to the States.

396
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,120
Alright.

397
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,560
I love Rapee,

398
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
and I want to take care of her.

399
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,960
I swear in front of your father

400
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,240
that I won't ever hurt her.

401
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,240
If I break my words,

402
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,800
he can come and haunt me,

403
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,520
and you can curse at me
for 7 days and 7 nights.

404
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,040
Gosh,

405
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,520
with all that yapping,

406
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,840
you must be Thai.

407
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,640
Your Thai is really good.

408
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,400
Who's your teacher?

409
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,280
He learned it all by himself

410
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
so that he can talk to you guys.

411
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Pretty fluent, right?

412
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,320
Thank you so much

413
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,040
for moo chamuang

414
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,640
and for fixing the motorbike.

415
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,520
From now on, please take care of Mom.

416
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,040
I will.

417
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
Welcome, Jake.

418
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,840
Jake!

419
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,920
Thank you!

420
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,800
Yay!

421
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,360
Thank you so much, Print.

422
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,400
Guys, should we go camping together?

423
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,760
Bet!

424
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,400
We haven't done it since Dad passed.

425
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,840
Mm, let's go.

426
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,080
Yes!

427
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,240
Jake, would you come with us?

428
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,440
I'd love to.

429
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,920
Yay!

430
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,320
Another reminder:

431
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,600
I snore in my sleep.

432
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,680
If you get annoyed
in the middle of the night

433
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,240
and kick me out,
just know I'm not leaving.

434
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
Okay!

435
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,840
Since this is your first night
moving in with me...

436
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,840
what'd you say
if we do something pleasurable?

437
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,040
I'd say I'm down.

438
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,400
This?

439
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,880
Your definition of pleasure?

440
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,240
And what did you think it was?

441
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,600
Hm...

442
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,440
I don't know.

443
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Maybe...

444
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,320
meditation?

445
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,840
With you lying next to me,

446
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,640
I don't have the heart to meditate.

447
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
No need to turn it off.

448
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,840
I like it like that.

449
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,960
Well, well.

450
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,760
You've always made Thai barbeque,

451
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
but now that you're dating a foreigner,

452
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,360
you're making real barbeque, Mom?

453
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,040
Woohoo!

454
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,600
Aw...

455
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
You also have something here.

456
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Sis,

457
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,760
Patty has something to ask.

458
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,360
Wait, aren't you
the one wanting to know?

459
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,720
You ask!

460
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,680
No, you ask!

461
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,920
Alright, just shoot
whatever questions you have,

462
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,240
and stop arguing!

463
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
So...

464
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,560
You and Rey...

465
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
What is your relationship?

466
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,640
Why did you just blurt it out like that?

467
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,960
Well, she took Rey home,

468
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,320
and yesterday, I saw...

469
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,520
Gosh, just say it.

470
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,400
You saw them kissing!

471
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,320
My, my!

472
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,960
Rey and I...

473
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,560
We...

474
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,040
We're...dating.

475
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,000
What, Mom?
Why are you so surprised?!

476
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,120
Nothing! I just...

477
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,440
never knew you liked girls.

478
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,360
It's nothing strange, Mom.

479
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,120
I also...like girls.

480
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,240
- Huh?
- What?!

481
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,400
For real?!

482
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Alright,

483
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,520
I'm gonna love whoever you guys love.

484
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,080
So that means
all my children like girls, right?

485
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,440
I'll have three daughters-in-law!

486
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,400
Nothing's set in stone, Mom.

487
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,440
Right?

488
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,480
Right.

489
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
What do we have here?

490
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Tell me!

491
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Nope.

492
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,280
It's a secret.

493
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,880
Guys,

494
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,960
here's my boyfriend, Auer.

495
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,560
Hi, Auer!

496
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,120
Whenever you have time,
come with Frank to meet me, alright?

497
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,720
Let's have Thai barbeque!

498
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,320
Of course, Mom.

499
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,640
I appreciate it.

500
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,240
It's very nice to meet you.

501
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,880
You're a handsome young man!

502
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,120
See you guys soon.

503
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Bye!

504
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,640
That's Orion.

505
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
His head...

506
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,040
Here, look!

507
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
You see that?

508
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,600
How pretty!

509
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
The stars?

510
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,480
Uh-uh.

511
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,440
Do you know
when I told them about us,

512
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
my heart was beating out of my chest!

513
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Why so?

514
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,440
Were you afraid
they wouldn't accept me?

515
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,960
Uh-uh, it's not that.

516
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,840
Bringing a partner home
for the first time

517
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
always gets people nervous, doesn't it?

518
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,880
For real, though, when I realized
how accepting my family was,

519
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,520
I was on cloud nine!

520
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,920
This must be how Mom felt

521
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,080
when she knew I opened up to Jake.

522
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,160
Aren't you afraid
I'm gonna be her new favorite child?

523
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,880
I'll just give up now.

524
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Only if...

525
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,480
you're titled
"The Best Daughter-In-Law."

526
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,880
Silly you!

527
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,560
We have a meeting with
the Chinese agency tomorrow evening.

528
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,720
Are you good?

529
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,120
Do you want me to go to China, Print?

530
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,760
Hm...

531
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,840
Honestly, I don't want you
to go to China or anything.

532
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,680
The thought of being far from you

533
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,400
makes me wanna tear up!

534
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,640
Waa!

535
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,560
But I don't wanna be
that one selfish person

536
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,480
who ruins your future.

537
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,000
So, I want you
to be the one who decides.

538
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,520
Though, no matter what your decision is,

539
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,440
you have my full support.

540
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,000
No matter how far you go,

541
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,400
no matter how long you take,

542
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,480
I'll be right here for you.

543
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,400
I think I have the answer.

544
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
Hi, Auntie!

545
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,040
Rey,

546
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,360
why didn't you tell me
that you invited Print home?

547
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,680
You're gonna have to take
a shower and get dressed.

548
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,960
I don't think we have time for guests.

549
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,800
It's alright.

550
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,800
I'm just here to give you my answer.

551
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Mother,

552
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I've been carefully contemplating this.

553
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm not going to China.

554
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
Rey,

555
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,600
I told you to meet them first;

556
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,360
otherwise, I won't consider
this a proper answer.

557
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,280
My answer
won't be any different from now.

558
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,320
The reason you're refusing

559
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,360
is that you want to be
with Print, isn't it?

560
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,880
I can tell

561
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,200
that you two aren't just friends.

562
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,440
If this is how much
you've changed after being with her,

563
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,520
I don't think she's the one for you.

564
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,720
Print has nothing
to do with my decision.

565
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,840
She only supports me
to choose my own path,

566
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,320
but that path of mine
doesn't lead to China.

567
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,240
I'd better go wait outside...

568
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,880
Now, if you'll excuse me.

569
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,120
Rey,

570
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,560
I think you should go back
to talk it out with Auntie.

571
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,360
I've thought this over, Print.

572
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,440
But are you sure
you decided for yourself,

573
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,000
and not for me?

574
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,920
Trust me.

575
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,000
I decided to be here truly for myself.

576
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,360
Mm!

577
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
Rey!

578
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,920
If you walk away any further,

579
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,360
I will disown you.

580
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,920
Please return this to Father.

581
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,400
Rey!

582
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,040
I want you to find something for me.

583
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,480
Anything that can stir the media.

584
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,160
What made you wake up
to prepare the flowers now?

585
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,280
I just realized

586
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,320
that I haven't paid respect to your dad.

587
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,160
Dad,

588
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,920
my name is Rey, Print's girlfriend.

589
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,440
Your daughter's
always worried about others,

590
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,800
so much so that she sometimes
forgets about herself, right?

591
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,560
Are you paying respect to my dad,

592
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,080
or are you actually snitching?

593
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Shh!

594
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,560
From now on,
please have no worries.

595
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,160
I'll take care of Print.

596
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,480
No matter what the future holds,

597
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,520
I won't ever let go of her hands.

598
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,440
I'm blushing in front of Dad.
