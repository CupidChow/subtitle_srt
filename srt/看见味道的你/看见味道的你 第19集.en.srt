1
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,380
- Cheers!  - Cheers!

2
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,580
That was close!

3
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,180
I’m surprised you two

4
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,220
went through that together.

5
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,020
What did I say?

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,060
You need me.

7
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,340
I can be

8
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,420
your human shield.

9
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,180
Thank God he wasn’t there.

10
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,259
Otherwise, we’d have to rescue him.

11
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,220
Am I a burden in your eyes?

12
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,940
Yes.

13
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,009
Hey,

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,100
why are you sitting there alone?

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,420
I have a question.

16
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,100
Do you regret

17
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,900
pushing me out

18
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,030
and going with them?

19
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,780
Come here, Weixun.

20
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,510
I'd like to have a word with you.

21
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,670
She isn’t like herself.

22
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,140
Still hasn’t recovered from the shock?

23
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,060
I’m going back to France.

24
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,510
I've booked the ticket.

25
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,200
It’s tomorrow.

26
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,700
Stop eating.

27
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,940
Don’t pretend you’re OK.

28
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,500
I’m not pretending.

29
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,420
I’m totally fine.

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,820
Stubbornness is even worse.

31
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,620
Can’t you take a break?

32
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,020
I’m done wasting time on you.

33
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,020
You don’t love me.

34
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,000
Bai Jing...

35
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,740
Enough. Say no more.

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,000
I don’t want to hear it.

37
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,540
The reason why I’m here today

38
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,100
is only to tell you

39
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,500
I have many wooers.

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,660
I don’t need you

41
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,740
a small bit

42
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,510
Alright.

43
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,470
I’m leaving.

44
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Let me give you a ride.

45
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,540
No need.

46
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,980
Why is she leaving?

47
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,580
She left?

48
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,790
Back to France.

49
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,020
Buzui,

50
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,340
you won this round.

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,900
She left without paying.

52
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,300
Hey,

53
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,720
take your eyes off money for a second!

54
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,980
Don’t be so stingy.

55
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,950
What do you know?

56
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,860
Money doesn’t grow on trees.

57
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,980
Relax,

58
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,980
you’ll get paid.

59
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,020
Bai Jing’s fiancé

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,100
is right here.

61
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,140
Ask him

62
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,060
for the money.

63
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,020
So have you guys

64
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,700
finally reconciled?

65
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,830
Not before they pay for the drinks.

66
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,700
Remember to pay for hers, too.

67
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,340
I’ll help him with the bill.

68
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,020
Sorry,

69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,740
I hurt your feelings before.

70
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,140
It’s all in the past.

71
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,180
Only the future matters.

72
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,820
You're right.

73
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,060
Life is short.

74
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,940
I remember you once said

75
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,860
to expand my possibilities.

76
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,500
I shouldn’t wait anymore

77
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,190
or waste my time.

78
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,580
What’s your point?

79
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,500
It might be a rough road tomorrow.

80
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,860
You want company?

81
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,780
I was simply making a statement.

82
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,020
Did I invite you?

83
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,120
Walk your lonely road.

84
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,300
Let go. What are you doing?

85
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,700
Where are you going?

86
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,460
Wanna escape?

87
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,440
I’m not afraid.

88
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,820
What is this?

89
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,060
PDA?

90
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,700
Get a room, OK?

91
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,940
Others are

92
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,420
still single.

93
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
This is outrageous.

94
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,060
You jealous?

95
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,020
You always pick on me.

96
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,940
No.

97
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,300
Not at all.

98
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,780
I’m happy for them.

99
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,700
Oh, please!

100
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,800
Isn’t Yi Beidao the love of your life?

101
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,380
No matter who he is,

102
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,860
I’m happy that he can be with

103
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,660
someone he loves.

104
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,550
Cheer up.

105
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,720
You’ll find your love.

106
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,120
Be patient.

107
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,420
Fine.

108
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,900
A toast to you two.

109
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,340
I’ll leave you alone.

110
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,220
Love might still be far away,

111
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,700
but you can always drink.

112
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,990
I’ll mix one for you.

113
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,720
You should also be happy for me

114
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,190
because I, too, have found my love.

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,380
I left in a rush

116
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,750
before giving you this.

117
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,140
It’s...

118
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,980
Pear Blossom.

119
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,460
When we were locked up in the winery,

120
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,380
I stole some.

121
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,820
It’s all here.

122
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,980
I thought it’d spill.

123
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,740
Looks like

124
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,700
you glued it well.

125
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,010
Thank you,

126
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,220
Buzui.

127
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,059
Actually...

128
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,980
Drink morning coffee

129
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,059
When I’m thinking about you

130
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,180
Close my eyes and enjoy the aftertaste

131
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,300
Thank you for showing up in my life.

132
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,060
A glass of old wine would make me drunk

133
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,020
I relive the past over and over

134
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,180
And start missing you more and more

135
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,900
Give me another chance

136
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,900
To be with you

137
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,980
One in a million chance

138
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,980
To be paired up with you

139
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,820
We're meant to be

140
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,900
Caught me unprepared

141
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
Your beauty enchanting

142
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,900
Even bland water tastes sweet

143
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,820
Words can’t express my love

144
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,980
Love songs break your heart

145
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,900
Let me comfort you

146
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,180
We can cuddle

147
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,500
Love is mysterious

148
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:50,460
I love you more than you know

149
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,860
Try it.

150
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,620
What do you think?

151
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,880
Better than Lu Weixun?

152
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,940
The soup

153
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
or you?

154
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,340
I know he’s better than me in your heart.

155
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,060
Why would I ask for an insult?

156
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,680
I mean the soup, of course.

157
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,620
Good or not,

158
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,580
I no longer care.

159
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,540
I’ve decided to leave

160
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,190
and abandon my attachment.

161
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,140
His cooking or whatnot

162
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,460
means nothing to me anymore.

163
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,510
You know you still love him.

164
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,020
Stop pretending.

165
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,180
I’ll forget eventually.

166
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,620
I deserve to be loved,

167
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,780
so I don’t want to waste my time

168
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,310
on people who don’t love me.

169
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,860
I deserve better.

170
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,460
Am I right?

171
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,580
You're clearheaded.

172
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,300
Truth be told,

173
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,180
I admire you.

174
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,660
I mean it.

175
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,580
You have a knack for wine tasting.

176
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,020
No need to copy Lu Weixun.

177
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,420
If you want to join WSA,

178
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,360
I can write a recommendation letter.

179
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,220
Thanks,

180
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,420
but no.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,620
Thank you for the dinner.

182
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,830
When is your flight?

183
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,680
Tomorrow morning.

184
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,350
I can give you a ride.

185
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,460
No need.

186
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,190
I don’t like bidding farewell at the airport.

187
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,860
Tomorrow is a new day.

188
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,620
Yeah.

189
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,140
Say goodbye to the past.

190
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,340
Congrats on turning over a new leaf!

191
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,540
Thanks.

192
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,500
Hope we can meet again.

193
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,860
You bet.

194
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,060
Farewell.

195
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,060
Mr. Lu.

196
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,540
The price needs to be set soon

197
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,140
to pacify the shareholders.

198
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,700
Let’s do it.

199
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,100
Mr. Lu,

200
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,320
everything is set.

201
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,880
Do you need anything else?

202
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,180
That’s it.

203
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

204
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,430
Sure. I’ll leave you alone.

205
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,900
Relaxation

206
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,420
can help cure

207
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,320
Lu Weixun’s hysterical ageusia.

208
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,300
It’s a little bit smelly.

209
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,620
Is it bad?

210
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,300
If it were before,

211
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,700
I’d give it up already.

212
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,620
Now,

213
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,180
I’ll give it a second chance.

214
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,300
Sulfur compounds,

215
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,140
once exposed to air,

216
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,220
are a part of this wine,

217
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,500
endowing it with aroma and richness.

218
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,500
That’s sort of a surprise.

219
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,700
What’s its price?

220
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,700
Retail price,

221
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,460
198 Yuan.

222
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,380
Really?

223
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,740
Bai Jing said

224
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
red wine produced by Rose Winery

225
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,220
was sold at least 700 Yuan.

226
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,540
All Rose Winery’s entry-level wine in the future

227
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,900
will all be priced under 300 Yuan.

228
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,200
Only by expanding the customer group

229
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,790
can the brand awareness be increased.

230
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,140
If positioned as luxury wine,

231
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,380
Rose Winery

232
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,140
would be dead soon.

233
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,500
300 is too much already.

234
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,680
What are you mumbling?

235
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,780
I said

236
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,700
you’re a genius.

237
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,060
What’s the name of this wine?

238
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,600
Irresistible.

239
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,620
I mean

240
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,910
the name of this wine is Irresistible.

241
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,340
I want people who taste it

242
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,860
to feel the same way.

243
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,900
I do.

244
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,060
I’m feeling it now.

245
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,180
What do you feel?

246
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,860
You can’t taste anything. Stop lying.

247
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,660
I’m wondering how long

248
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,500
your palate will stay this time.

249
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,220
Don’t worry.

250
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,020
We’ll soon be able to find

251
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,780
where Pear Blossom is.

252
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,180
Hold on. It's freezing.

253
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,740
It is?

254
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,580
Yes.

255
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,940
So cold.

256
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,060
So?

257
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
At this point,

258
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
you should give me your coat.

259
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,940
Only fools would do that.

260
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,980
Cliché.

261
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,660
Have you ever dated a girl?

262
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,940
Now it’s warm.

263
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,940
Do you

264
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,140
always do this to girls?

265
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
Just one girl.

266
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,500
Now it’s two. Is it not enough?

267
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,340
I mean you're the only one.

268
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,940
You...

269
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,260
You mean

270
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,060
you’re still a virg...

271
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,380
Wait.

272
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,260
Are you?

273
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,540
Yes or no?

274
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,060
Wine Consultant, that public account of yours,

275
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,580
should be reopened.

276
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,060
I’m serious.

277
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,380
I read your articles

278
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,340
on it.

279
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,580
- I know.  - That public account

280
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,980
allowed you to express your real thoughts.

281
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,980
So are you?

282
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,340
Hold on.

283
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,120
- No!  - Yi Nanke.

284
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,340
- I’m not!  - Are you?

285
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,580
- No!  - Yes!

286
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,300
- I’m not!  - I know you are.

287
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Lucky me!

288
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,460
I’m not.

289
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,540
Come here.

290
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,540
What?

291
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,260
I’m doing experiments.

292
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,380
More kisses?

293
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,580
Problem?

294
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,220
You’re the boss.

295
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
You call the shot.

296
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,220
I think

297
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,300
kissing is unnecessary.

298
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,340
This is work.

299
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,790
You have to listen to me.

300
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,700
Wear your coat. Let’s go out.

301
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,480
Where are we going?

302
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,100
Out for a walk.

303
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,820
It’s cold outside.

304
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,260
This is the place you like?

305
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,780
Yeah.

306
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,620
I used to come here all the time.

307
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,300
What do you think? Good, huh?

308
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,060
Not really.

309
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,300
So picky!

310
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,780
You came here often?

311
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,420
Whenever I was upset,

312
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,780
I’d come here.

313
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,300
When I was happy,

314
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,100
I’d also come here.

315
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,940
So are you happy or upset now?

316
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,020
Neither.

317
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,700
You’re

318
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,260
so pretty.

319
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,460
Nobody can

320
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,780
take advantage of me.

321
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,820
You can take advantage of me.

322
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,580
So this is the real you!

323
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,340
Look.

324
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,700
Look at that girl.

325
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,660
She’s a lamb.

326
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,060
You can date her.

327
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,830
What a coincidence!

328
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,020
I withdraw my last sentence.

329
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,300
So do I.

330
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,340
Nanke said he liked this place,

331
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,070
so he brought me here for a walk.

332
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,390
This is also my favorite place,

333
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,620
so I came with He Buzui.

334
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,380
We’re like-minded.

335
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,380
He Buzui came here with me, too.

336
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,900
Right?

337
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,020
I’ll leave you two alone then.

338
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,460
Bye.

339
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,600
What's wrong with you?

340
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,260
Why did you say that?

341
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,740
I was helping them.

342
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,380
More like stirring up trouble.

343
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,320
You don’t understand.

344
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,740
Jealousy

345
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,980
can produce chemistry.

346
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,340
Is that from your experience?

347
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,380
You know

348
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,060
the best way

349
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,820
to shut a girl’s mouth?

350
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,100
Don’t think you can scare me.

351
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,580
You...

352
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
She stays by your side

353
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,580
But you appear in front of me again

354
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,340
We pass by each other

355
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,620
Our thoughts start spreading along the coast

356
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,620
What’s on your mind?

357
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,620
So

358
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,140
you and your first love used to date here.

359
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Are you mad?

360
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,420
I’m not.

361
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,620
I won’t get jealous.

362
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,940
Jealous?

363
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,220
Yi Nanke only said that

364
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,580
to make me jealous.

365
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,700
You’re a wise man.

366
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,750
Does he still hold a grudge?

367
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,180
I guess so.

368
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,940
When we were

369
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,420
locked up in the winery,

370
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,900
he told me

371
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,460
he’d never forgive me.

372
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,780
I won’t blame him.

373
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,480
If it makes him feel better to hate me,

374
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,060
then let him be.

375
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,420
But you...

376
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,620
I’m fine.

377
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,020
Hatred is a heavy burden.

378
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,900
I’d rather be happy.

379
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,620
He Buzui.

380
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,420
You’re smarter

381
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,900
than I think.

382
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,780
You praised me.

383
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,660
What are you up to?

384
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,900
Nothing.

385
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,740
Don’t overthink it.

386
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,380
Everyone,

387
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,660
this year is ending.

388
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,340
Our list of Top 10 Wines

389
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,400
has always been highly anticipated.

390
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,860
This time, with the help of Mr. Mu,

391
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,280
we must make it better.

392
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,820
So,

393
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,060
any idea?

394
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,700
We’ve discussed

395
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,500
the selections.

396
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,960
This is the preliminary list.

397
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,660
Irresistible.

398
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,740
Isn’t it Lu Weixun’s...

399
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,300
The price wasn’t set

400
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,180
until he came back

401
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,620
from the south.

402
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,940
Do you have a problem with it, Mr. Mu?

403
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,940
Did you play favorites?

404
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,420
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

405
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,260
The wines on the list

406
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,740
were selected after blind tasting and voting.

407
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,300
Yes.

408
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,140
We might not be wine experts,

409
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,200
but we abide by professional ethics.

410
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,980
Sir,

411
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
your words aren’t fair.

412
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,780
Since Irresistible entered the market,

413
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,240
it’s been well-received,

414
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,460
especially among young people,

415
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,140
for its fruity flavor and affordable price.

416
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,940
Considering its taste,

417
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
brewing process,

418
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,020
culture,

419
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,660
and market value,

420
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,980
it’s qualified

421
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,580
for the Top 10 Wines.

422
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,380
It seems to be irresistible.

423
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,380
Lu Weixun,

424
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,900
is your palate back?

425
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,500
idol

426
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,940
Are you OK?

427
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,860
You sick?

428
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,960
Where’s Buzui?

429
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,020
I’m going to tell her I love her.

430
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,500
What?

431
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,540
Are you sure you aren’t sick?

432
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,300
You serious?

433
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,780
I need your help

434
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,580
not your doubt.

435
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,460
Buzui

436
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,980
is really something.

437
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,260
This kind of thing can only happen to her.

438
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,620
My idol is gone.

439
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,780
You aren’t my idol anymore.

440
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,840
You broke my heart.

441
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,820
Enough.

442
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
As far as you know,

443
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,100
what does she like?

444
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,060
Money.

445
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,220
And?

446
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,700
She’s into

447
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,140
gentlemen.

448
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:14,940
Tell me

449
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,340
the general idea

450
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,780
of what a gentleman is.

451
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,670
Gentle and attractive.

452
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,430
Charming and romantic.

453
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,720
Anything else?

454
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,030
Sincere and caring.

455
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,740
Do you know

456
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,260
her favorite place?

457
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,780
Favorite place?

458
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,260
Well,

459
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,580
you’ve been sharing an apartment for so long,

460
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,300
you of all people should know

461
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,270
her likes and dislikes.

462
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,860
In my opinion,

463
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,700
your best choice

464
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,660
is to play it straight.

465
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,820
Straight?

466
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,220
Be frankly

467
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,620
and tell her your feelings.

468
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,080
That nonsense of being sincere and romantic

469
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,910
is too complicated for her.

470
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,500
If she doesn’t get it

471
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,380
or mistakes it,

472
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,960
that’ll be a disaster.

473
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,420
You have a point.

474
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,700
OK.

475
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,580
Hello.

476
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,180
Hi.

477
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,540
I’m here to visit the winery owner.

478
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,200
ID, please.

479
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,500
Yang Feng, the winery owner.

480
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,620
What’s your relationship with him?

481
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,790
I’m the victim of this case.

482
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,200
He’s already dead.

483
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,060
Dead?

484
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,980
When the police got to his place,

485
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,340
he had already committed suicide.

486
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,820
Where is his family?

487
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,620
Haven’t been able to reach them.

488
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,900
Thank you.

489
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,980
My idol is the best.

490
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,280
Not only is he a top-notch sommelier,

491
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,940
but the wine he made is also of high quality.

492
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,580
That new neighbor across the street

493
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,060
seems weird.

494
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,100
Whoa,

495
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,820
gotcha ya!

496
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,690
100 hours again.

497
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,980
It’s Pear Blossom.

498
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,650
Pear Blossom

499
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,780
in exchange for 100 hours.

500
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:23,900
Open up.

501
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,980
I know you're here.

502
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,940
It's you, Mu Chunfeng!

503
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,989
Come with me.

504
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,170
What are you doing?

505
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,820
I know

506
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,690
what you’re doing inside.

507
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,949
What's wrong with you?

508
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,230
- Let go of me.  - Come.

509
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,860
Let go of me. Let go.

510
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,420
Hurry!

511
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,460
What are you doing?

512
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,020
Come.

513
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,060
Let go.

514
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,130
It is Pear Blossom.

515
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,170
Pear Blossom.

516
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,300
Yi Nanke called this morning,

517
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
saying Yang had committed suicide.

518
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,700
He killed himself?

519
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,300
That’s unexpected.

520
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,220
I don’t think

521
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,700
everything happened is a coincidence.

522
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,540
Careful.

523
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,580
Come in.

524
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,820
Weixun,

525
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,820
this bastard was watching your every move

526
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,180
through the telescope.

527
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,240
Even I know that was wrong.

528
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,710
That’s an invasion of privacy.

529
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,470
What do you mean?

530
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,040
Something is wrong with your palate.

531
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,420
No.

532
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,980
You two are looking for a cure.

533
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,700
What?

534
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,140
Guess I’m right.

535
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,870
Come back to Lu Group

536
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,380
as your father hoped

537
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,740
and draw an end to everything.

538
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,980
Lu Group.

539
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,750
I should've known you two were in cahoots.

540
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,680
He’s concerned about you.

541
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,820
You should leave.

542
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,580
Good day.

543
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:14,700
You...

544
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,190
You let him leave like that?

545
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,060
Or what?

546
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,860
You want to arrest him

547
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,960
and make the headlines again?

548
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,820
idol

549
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,740
is it true?

550
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,380
You can't taste anything?

551
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,460
No wonder.

552
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,140
Dad.

553
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,300
Hey, you.

554
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,260
Why are you here?

555
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
I brought you

556
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,600
freshly picked pears.

557
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,860
I can have others pick them up.

558
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,180
You are still weak.

559
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
How is your heart?

560
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,580
I’m not that fragile.

561
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,380
Besides, I heard about Mr. Yang’s winery.

562
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,640
I’m worried about you.

563
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,940
Thank you.

564
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,380
Have a seat.

565
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,960
How are you?

566
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,680
Not too bad.

567
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,500
Dad,

568
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,260
Mr. Yang was always nice to others.

569
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,980
How could he...

570
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,940
Perhaps he acted on impulse.

571
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,860
Are those friends

572
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,660
of yours OK?

573
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,740
They managed to get out eventually.

574
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,180
Thank goodness.

575
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,660
I’m glad they're safe.

576
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:56,980
Zhong,

577
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,340
bring him some water.

578
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,860
Yes.

579
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,620
Master.

580
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,540
Have you found the answer?

581
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,140
Not yet.

582
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,870
But I found something else.

583
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,540
What is it?

584
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,900
Lu Weixun seems to have lost his palate.

585
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,420
Don’t make me guess.

586
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,140
I don’t want to upset you.

587
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,060
Are you sure?

588
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,100
Sorry, I’m late.

589
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,220
You asked me here on such short notice.

590
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,100
Is it an emergency?

591
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,100
You...this...

592
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,100
What’s the occasion?

593
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,460
You have guests coming?

594
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,340
Tonight, this place is ours,

595
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,760
just you and me.

596
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
So,

597
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,980
do you have something important to tell me?

598
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,260
It is important.
