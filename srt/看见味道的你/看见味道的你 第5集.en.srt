1
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,160
Excuse me,

2
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,220
your John Collins.

3
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,900
Thanks.

4
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,140
Why do you think Lu Weixun still

5
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,979
makes no response?

6
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,180
Many people guess that

7
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,620
he doesn’t accept my challenge for fear of losing.

8
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,550
I don’t think so.

9
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,100
To be honest,

10
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,500
I’m the one who fears Mr. Lu’s

11
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
talent for taste.

12
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,460
Also,

13
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,300
I’ve been curious about something.

14
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,740
He said...

15
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,660
It’s you.

16
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,600
Aren’t I the psycho who followed you?

17
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,820
My apologies.

18
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,680
I misunderstood you that day.

19
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,200
Is this cup of wine made by you?

20
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,940
Is there anything wrong?

21
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,579
John Collins

22
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,980
is a drink with whisky base

23
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,500
plus lemon, syrup and soda.

24
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,680
Bartenders often focus on

25
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,540
the proportion of lemon and soda,

26
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,900
in order not to cover the mellow taste of whisky.

27
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,820
On the contrary, you added more lemon

28
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,100
and hid the mellow taste of whisky

29
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,620
behind the sour taste of lemon

30
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,720
and let it permeate the throat

31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,000
when it reached there.

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,060
Am I right?

33
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
I just added one more piece of lemon.

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,820
Then make another one for me, please.

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,390
Since you know wine so well,

36
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,100
this one will be my treat.

37
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,780
Thank you.

38
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,380
What’s going on between

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,020
Lu Weixun and his dad?

40
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,640
How could one father trap his own son?

41
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
To be honest,

42
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,500
I’m the one who fears Mr. Lu’s

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,820
talent for taste.

44
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,020
Also,

45
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
I’ve been curious about something.

46
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,100
He said he wanted to be independent of his father,

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,760
but isn’t his talent for taste

48
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,540
exactly from his father?

49
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,940
Here and here.

50
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,660
Take it to my office after you correct them.

51
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,060
Okay.

52
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,860
Mi Ya,

53
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,660
this is the article I just edited

54
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,900
for tonight’s game.

55
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,420
Take it to my office

56
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,630
after you correct the places I marked.

57
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,380
Okay.

58
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,110
Why did you just write one article?

59
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,700
What’s wrong, Mi Ya?.

60
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,140
You only wrote articles for Lu Weixun’s victory.

61
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,470
We’ll have nothing to publish if he loses.

62
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,820
Guys,

63
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,190
are the articles ready?

64
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,060
Mi Ya wants us to prepare articles

65
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,740
for Lu Weixun’s defeat.

66
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,140
Get back to your work first.

67
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,540
Mi Ya.

68
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,740
What do we do?

69
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,700
Write them now?

70
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,380
But there’s not enough time.

71
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,260
I have no idea.

72
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,420
Mi Ya,

73
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,980
I know you are

74
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,830
considering for our magazine,

75
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,820
but it’s really not necessary.

76
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,500
Chief Editor,

77
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,860
I’m well aware of Mu Chunfeng’s strength.

78
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,260
He’s not that simple.

79
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,220
Okay.

80
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,960
Hello, all fans of Weixun,

81
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,780
today our idol

82
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,659
will formally battle with Mu Chunfeng.

83
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,740
Are you excited?

84
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,940
Yes!

85
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,580
Now we’re at the door of Wanjia Hotel,

86
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,960
waiting eagerly for the magnificent entrance of our idol.

87
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,540
He’s here.

88
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,860
Lu Weixun! Lu Weixun! Lu Weixun!

89
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,700
Mr. Lu,

90
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,100
what’s your opinion

91
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,070
about this game?

92
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,420
Except for hoping it’ll end soon,

93
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,750
what opinion can I have?

94
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,460
Folks,

95
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,220
isn’t our idol handsome?

96
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,500
You didn’t open the door for me. I’ll deduct your salaries.

97
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,780
Are you disabled?

98
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,260
Can’t you do it yourself?

99
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,900
Lu Weixun is the focus

100
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,460
of attention at all times.

101
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,420
I hope he won’t be after this game.

102
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,800
I don’t want him to be always the focus of attention.

103
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,620
I’ll definitely make your dream come true.

104
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,750
May it be a happy collaboration, then.

105
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,900
What are you doing?

106
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,540
I’m nervous.

107
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,300
Are you having the game or me?

108
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,980
I’m being nervous for you.

109
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,900
Are you sure you’re gonna do that?

110
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,620
Why am I having a foreboding feeling?

111
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,430
Just don’t make trouble for me.

112
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,659
Can I go out for breath?

113
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,780
I’m short of breathing in this room.

114
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,780
Don’t be long.

115
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,220
I’ll feel dizzy if you keep walking around here.

116
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,820
Yes.

117
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,820
Zhong,

118
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,540
it’s dirty here.

119
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,400
Brush it later.

120
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,180
Okay.

121
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,420
Mr. Wan. Mr. Wan. Mr. Wan.

122
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,280
What happened?

123
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,220
Are you alright?

124
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,180
I’m so sorry.

125
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,740
How could you run

126
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,500
on the hallway?

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,620
I’m okay.

128
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,220
I’m okay.

129
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,380
Mr. Wan.

130
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,940
You know me?

131
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,140
It’s me,

132
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,980
He Buzui.

133
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,780
My dad

134
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,940
is He Wangyou.

135
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,380
Buzui.

136
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,060
You’ve grown up.

137
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,190
You know her?

138
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,620
This is my old friend’s daughter.

139
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,900
You’re a big girl now.

140
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,500
Mr. Wan, I’m sorry.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,220
It’s my mistake.

142
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,020
Never mind.

143
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,900
I’m to blame.

144
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,420
I went up there myself.

145
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,940
Mr. Wan,

146
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,100
leave things of this kind to me, please.

147
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,780
Okay.

148
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Oh God,

149
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,460
is this hotel yours?

150
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,660
I couldn’t do other things so I opened this small hotel.

151
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,540
I’m the same as I used to do

152
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,460
and prefer doing things myself.

153
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,700
Why are you here?

154
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,140
You’re staying here?

155
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,180
I’m here for the game.

156
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,420
I’m Lu Weixun’s assistant.

157
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,820
I’m kind of lost now.

158
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,740
You’re looking for the waiting room, right?

159
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,540
Walk straight

160
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,800
and turn right.

161
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,440
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

162
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,620
By the way,

163
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,440
go to see my dad if you’re free.

164
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,740
He misses you.

165
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,380
Okay.

166
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,180
Goodbye, Mr. Wan.

167
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,980
Mr. Wan, are you really okay?

168
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,740
Yes, I’m okay.

169
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,740
Mr. Lu.

170
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,100
Mr. Lu.

171
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,840
It’s almost time for the game.

172
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,620
Mr. Lu.

173
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,660
Yong.

174
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,620
Buzui.

175
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,540
You’re here.

176
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,510
I’ve been worried sick.

177
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,790
You’re thinner.

178
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,660
You’ve suffered in your confinement, haven’t you?

179
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,540
I’m fine.

180
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,980
Everything is fine.

181
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,310
You don’t need to worry.

182
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,140
Where’s he?

183
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,140
Is he gonna molest Buzui again?

184
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,900
Up yours.

185
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,860
What nonsense.

186
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,780
That won’t happen even in TV plays.

187
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,980
Who’s the man inside?

188
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,020
Lu Weixun,

189
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,780
the son of the boss of a group.

190
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
How could he take a fancy to He Buzui?

191
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,380
Boss,

192
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,580
I don’t like that sort of remark.

193
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,560
Alright, alright,

194
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,380
she’s safe.

195
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,740
Don’t worry.

196
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,340
Only she will harass him but not the other way round.

197
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,900
Go.

198
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,620
That makes sense.

199
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,220
Wait for me.

200
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,980
Well,

201
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
there are two chances left after this one, right?

202
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,480
You think it’s too many or too few?

203
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,780
I...

204
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,300
Of course I hope we can break away soon.

205
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,260
Is it so painful to be kissed by me?

206
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,950
Certainly it’s awkward to be kissed by someone I don’t like.

207
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,820
You hate me so much?

208
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,580
Not much.

209
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,980
You bit me.

210
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,980
Are you a dog?

211
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,320
You wanna be fired?

212
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,100
Are there better ways

213
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,760
to deal with rascals like you?

214
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Miss He,

215
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,980
you gotta understand.

216
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,340
People should have self-knowledge.

217
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,340
Whether it’s the process or the result of

218
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,340
the exchange of our senses of taste,

219
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,400
you are the one who get the advantage.

220
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,110
Keep the time when I’m on the stage.

221
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,620
My idol is here. My idol is here.

222
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,220
Lu Weixun! Lu Weixun is here!

223
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,260
Is that the manner of a top sommelier?

224
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,260
The temperament of a winner.

225
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,220
The chosen one.

226
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,220
Folks,

227
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,640
hit on the little heart

228
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,980
and I’ll give you prizes

229
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,510
after my idol wins the game.

230
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
This way, please.

231
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,040
Welcome our distinguished guests

232
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,400
and all media persons here.

233
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,240
I feel glad to gather here with you

234
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,040
to attend a feast

235
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
of wine evaluation industry,

236
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,080
the game between the excellent sommelier at home,

237
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,400
Mr. Lu Weixun, and Mr. Mu Chunfeng.

238
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,960
Let me introduce

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
the rules of this game first.

240
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,320
As you see,

241
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,080
there are fifty cups of wine

242
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,400
in front of each sommelier.

243
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,320
Next,

244
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,600
the sommeliers will taste them and

245
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,620
write their information on cards

246
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
which includes

247
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,880
their vintages and ingredients.

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
Whoever finishes first

249
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,320
will win the game.

250
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,480
Gentlemen,

251
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,840
are you ready?

252
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,480
Okay,

253
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,400
I announce that

254
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,240
our game begins now.

255
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,580
It’s a tight match.

256
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,280
Yes.

257
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,280
Look at them.

258
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,440
Their styles of tasting wine are in contrast to each other.

259
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,080
Mr. Mu is unhurried and steady.

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,120
Lu Weixun is quick and decisive.

261
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Although Mu Chunfeng is slower,

262
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,120
on their scores,

263
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,560
he’s as accurate as Lu Weixun.

264
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,040
In games like this,

265
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
when the accuracy is the same,

266
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
what counts is the speed.

267
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,480
My idol drinks it.

268
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,780
Is it because it’s particularly good

269
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,020
or are there special reasons?

270
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,960
Cigar.

271
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,040
The tannin is strong.

272
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,560
The structure is huge and distinct.

273
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,600
This is it.

274
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,380
What’s the matter with Lu Weixun?

275
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,100
Lu Weixun slows down.

276
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,320
Mu Chunfeng is still steady.

277
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
He’s so consistent.

278
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,600
Cherry,

279
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,640
rose,

280
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
raspberry,

281
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,160
plum,

282
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,840
violet,

283
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,840
pepper.

284
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
How’s that possible?

285
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,520
It’s the third sip.

286
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,800
What are you doing?

287
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,760
You’re so close to victory.

288
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
How’s that possible?

289
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,800
How’s that possible?

290
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
There are two contrasting flavors.

291
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,580
No one has ever made blends like this.

292
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,120
What on earth is it?

293
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
What is it?

294
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,360
What on earth is it?

295
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,320
Wrong.

296
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,040
Wrong.

297
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,280
Not it.

298
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,600
Not it.

299
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,240
Two contrasting flavors.

300
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,060
No one has ever made blends like this.

301
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,960
What on earth is it?

302
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,600
Thank you.

303
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,600
I announce that

304
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,440
the winner of this game

305
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,600
is Mr. Mu Chunfeng.

306
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,740
Congratulations.

307
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,280
Mr. Mu.

308
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,440
Here, Mr. Mu.

309
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,560
It has been rigged!

310
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,380
It’s absolutely been rigged!

311
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,040
Where the hell are you from?

312
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,160
How could you possibly defeat the sommelier of genius?

313
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
How much did your sugar daddy pay you?

314
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
I’ll double it!

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
Let go of me. Let go!

316
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,840
Don’t pull me.

317
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,000
I’ll double it!

318
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,760
Lu Weixun!

319
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,260
Lu Weixun, how could you lose?

320
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,780
It’s such an important game. How could you lose?

321
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,340
Watch out. Watch out.

322
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,640
It’s okay. You have my support.

323
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,840
Yes, mine, too.

324
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,840
We’ll always like you, Lu Weixun.

325
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,360
Let go of me. Let go!

326
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,290
Lu Weixun is gonna fall from the altar.

327
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,340
Mi Ya, let’s go.

328
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,720
We only prepared

329
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,200
articles for Lu Weixun’s victory.

330
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
Now Mu Chunfeng wins.

331
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,080
If we don’t go back and write another one now,

332
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,760
we’ll fall behind others.

333
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,840
I’ve prepared one in my mailbox.

334
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,180
You need to work hard tonight.

335
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,690
Stand there.

336
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,410
Learn that from her.

337
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
Can you be of use to me?

338
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,720
You’ll work overtime tonight.

339
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,280
Go.

340
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,280
Okay, Chief Editor.

341
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,800
My victory over Lu Weixun

342
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,320
is within expectation,

343
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
but it makes me...

344
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
it makes me

345
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,920
a bit surprised, too.

346
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
I believe you’ll have more and more fans.

347
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,010
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,440
You’ll do better in the future.

349
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:58,960
Thanks.

350
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,680
Thank you, everyone here.

351
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,540
See you around.

352
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,560
Hello.

353
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,600
The magazine.

354
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,360
Mr. Lu,

355
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,400
a call from the magazine.

356
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,920
Okay.

357
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,800
Hello.

358
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,240
You’re welcome.

359
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,560
It’s within expectation.

360
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,400
Make arrangements as we’ve agreed.

361
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,440
Okay.

362
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,800
Mr. Lu,

363
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
isn’t it a little bit...

364
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,160
What?

365
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,120
Cruel?

366
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,160
To be honest,

367
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,090
I didn’t want to do that.

368
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,000
He’s my son, after all.

369
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
But one day,

370
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,440
he’ll understand why I did it as his father.

371
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
I had to do it.

372
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,450
Go and tell Mu Chunfeng that

373
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,920
he doesn’t need to worry about that matter.

374
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,240
Yes.

375
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,000
Buzui!

376
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,200
Buzui!

377
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,680
Buzui.

378
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,480
Mr. Wan.

379
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,000
You’re leaving already?

380
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,460
I haven’t had a good chat with you yet.

381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,260
I have work to do today.

382
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,600
Let’s chat later.

383
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
-Okay.  -See you, Mr. Wan.

384
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,560
I told you that

385
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,300
you are mean and bad-tempered

386
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,680
and you’d be taught a lesson sooner or later.

387
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,680
I advise you to change them quickly,

388
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,400
but I bet you can’t.

389
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,890
Why do you follow me?

390
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,600
Now you’re following me.

391
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,800
This is my home.

392
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,360
You lost the game

393
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,960
and I kindly stay here to keep you company.

394
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
You are too ungrateful

395
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,490
to those who try to help you.

396
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,680
I know you hope I lose

397
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,440
like they do.

398
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes.

399
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,340
I hope you lose.

400
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,880
You’re so petty and suspicious.

401
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
It serves you right.

402
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,530
Then why are you still here?

403
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,120
Go away right now.

404
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,520
Go.

405
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Go!

406
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,240
Okay, I’ll go now!

407
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,920
I’ll be a dog if I stay here!

408
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Weixun,

409
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I’m leaving.

410
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Where are you leaving for?

411
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,160
Aren’t you going home with me?

412
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,760
Why are you leaving?

413
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,720
Aren’t you proud of me?

414
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,320
Is it because I lost?

415
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,920
Are you leaving me behind?

416
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,560
Mom!

417
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,280
Mom!

418
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,320
Hello,

419
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,360
my lady.

420
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,160
How could

421
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,800
someone be so hateful?

422
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,680
He’s so hateful,

423
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,610
but you still risked your life to protect him.

424
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,480
He hired me.

425
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,240
I did that for my salaries.

426
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,700
Do you get the money, then?

427
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,360
Not yet.

428
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,600
So

429
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,880
it isn’t because of money, is it?

430
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,160
Oh, then is it because

431
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
I like him?

432
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,800
You’re kidding me.

433
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,920
Are you really gonna leave him now

434
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,460
when he’s so dejected?

435
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
He kicked me out.

436
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,280
I didn’t ask to leave myself.

437
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,480
Besides, that’s what I wished.

438
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,040
Okay.

439
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,040
Then I’ll congratulate you on your escaping from the devil’s world.

440
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,680
Wait for me to return in triumph.

441
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,160
Okay, bye-bye.

442
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,490
Why are you here?

443
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,360
You asked me to.

444
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,360
Me?

445
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,560
I heard you calling me.

446
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,400
You need friends.

447
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,040
You need help.

448
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,160
I need no one.

449
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,720
No one can help me

450
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,080
except myself.

451
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,940
Get out of here.

452
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,120
You’re drunk.

453
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,820
Mi Di.

454
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,640
The world is big.

455
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,540
I will never see you again.

456
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,320
He doesn’t even say goodbye.

457
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,160
So unfeeling.

458
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,600
Oh no,

459
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,810
he didn’t kill himself, did he?

460
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,360
Lu Weixun!

461
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,570
You said you wouldn’t be drunk.

462
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,960
I catch you.

463
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,440
It was she who pretended not to pay attention.

464
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,960
Get up.

465
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,280
It stuck in my mind and then sprouted.

466
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,440
Words said a long time ago

467
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,040
enlarged slowly in my memories.

468
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,120
Promises and silence mingled.

469
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,690
It’s too cold on the ground.

470
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,520
Here, let me help you.

471
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,800
You’ll catch a cold.

472
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,840
Scenes that I hugged you

473
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,240
I’ll get you a quilt.

474
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,320
are just a variety show between two people.

475
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,920
Don’t leave.

476
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,120
I didn’t lose.

477
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,200
Dad hasn’t come back yet.

478
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,320
Don’t leave, Mom.

479
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
After being loved, hurt and pained,

480
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,480
I forgot and was soothed and healed.

481
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,880
But the scar was still there when things restarted.

482
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,920
I’m pursuing, protecting and fantasizing.

483
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I promise you.

484
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,200
I won’t leave.

485
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,760
But I said

486
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,120
I’d be a dog if I stayed here.

487
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,880
Don’t go.

488
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,690
Forget about it.

489
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,280
Dogs are cute,

490
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,010
aren’t they?

491
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,510
Chief Editor.

492
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,710
Doctor Wine will terminate

493
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,510
the cooperation with Lu Weixun.

494
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,360
I have sent you the notice.

495
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,219
Print it for me.

496
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,520
Okay.

497
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,190
Come in.

498
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,880
What’s up?

499
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,920
Have you received my resignation?

500
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,320
I wanna know the reasons.

501
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,200
Lu Weixun’s failure led to his loss of value.

502
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,080
As his editor,

503
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,060
I should take responsibility

504
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,680
for the sake of the company.

505
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,460
How about this?

506
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,440
You can take a month’s leave.

507
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,200
We’ll talk again after you think it over.

508
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,440
I’ve made up my mind.

509
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,900
That’s not sure, is it?

510
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
Today will be the first day of your vacation.

511
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,220
Go.

512
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,060
Thanks, Chief Editor.

513
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
It’s a rare chance. Have a good time.

514
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,280
We disowned Mr. Lu?

515
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Yes.

516
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,880
In that case,

517
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,840
this is

518
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,840
great news!

519
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
Something big happened.

520
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,770
Mi Ya offered her resignation.

521
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,680
Chief Editor didn’t agree

522
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,800
and let her take a month’s leave.

523
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,640
Paid.

524
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,000
Do you think

525
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,160
it’s too late for me to offer my resignation now?

526
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,320
Of course not.

527
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,400
But perhaps

528
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,680
you’ll be fired immediately.

529
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,280
Miss Mi,

530
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,320
you’re finally back.

531
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,400
The competition

532
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,680
had such an unexpected winner.

533
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,120
We hope you can deliver an article

534
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,080
to your official account.

535
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,920
Wine of our winery

536
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,480
would never be identified by Lu Weixun.

537
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,440
He’s no longer the sommelier

538
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,800
of genius that he was before.

539
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
We hope you can

540
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,560
make use of his defeat

541
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
and recommend our wine to the public.

542
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,480
Sorry.

543
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,140
I don’t advertise.

544
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
That’s alright.

545
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,360
You cannot recommend our winery.

546
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,220
But as long as you blacken Lu Weixun’s name,

547
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,420
I think we can negotiate over the price.

548
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,460
Sorry.

549
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,840
I don’t want to write that sort of stuff.

550
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,060
Miss Mi,

551
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,580
please consider it again.

552
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,880
Morning.

553
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,180
Break news.

554
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,700
The magazine, Doctor Wine, announced that it had ended

555
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,220
its cooperation with the sommelier of genius, Lu Weixun.

556
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,920
It is learned that the day before yesterday

557
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,320
the sommelier of genius, Lu Weixun,

558
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,200
was defeated by the up-and-coming star, Mu Chunfeng,

559
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,280
which broke Lu Weixun’s

560
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,320
unbeaten record.

561
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,880
The magazine, Doctor Wine,

562
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
is the barometer of sommeliers’ world.

563
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,640
Does its move mean

564
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,260
the age of Mu Chunfeng has come

565
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,120
and Lu Weixun’s name has been something of the past?

566
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,600
The media love exaggerating.

567
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,700
Don’t take it seriously.

568
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,360
You’ll lose if you do.

569
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,600
I’ve lost whether

570
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,940
I take it seriously or not.

571
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,560
Actually,

572
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,600
I’m at fault, too.

573
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,840
Maybe it’s because

574
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,400
I didn’t take care of your sense of taste.

575
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,560
Definitely.

576
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,680
I didn’t expect you would be so upset.

577
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,180
You said you were leaving.

578
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,040
Why are you still here?

579
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,600
Go away.

580
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,360
Go away.

581
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,800
I’m leaving

582
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,080
but not now.

583
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,650
What do you mean?

584
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,320
Don’t leave.

585
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,200
I didn’t lose.

586
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,640
There’s a contract between us.

587
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,640
I have to do my jobs accordingly.

588
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,900
Besides, I haven’t got the money yet.

589
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,560
I drafted the contract.

590
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,100
I have rights to change it.

591
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,770
Still, I’m not leaving.

592
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,420
I haven’t paid off my debts yet.

593
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,920
I don’t need that.

594
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,880
I’ve lost.

595
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,700
You mean nothing to me.

596
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
You’re talking nonsense.

597
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,600
You just lost a game.

598
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,120
Must you be like this?

599
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,460
I don’t allow failure in my life.

600
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,820
Can you pull yourself together?

601
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,380
Being defeated by

602
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,060
a small fish whom no one knew before,

603
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,460
can you really accept it?

604
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,220
You lost

605
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,400
just because of too much pressure and shortage of time.

606
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,800
Can’t you give yourself another chance?

607
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,300
As I reckoned,

608
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,660
Ricard is the real French taste.

609
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,260
Mr. Lu.

610
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,160
Thanks for your hard work.

611
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,260
Good job.

612
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,960
You flatter me, Mr. Lu.

613
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,060
There’s something that puzzles me.

614
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,860
You mean that cup of blended wine?

615
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:22,980
Yes.

616
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,820
-Is it...  -It’s my order.

617
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,910
Are you feeling pity for me?

618
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,220
Have I ended up

619
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,420
like that already?

620
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,080
I don’t need your pity.

621
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,460
Know something about yourself.

622
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,980
Go away.
