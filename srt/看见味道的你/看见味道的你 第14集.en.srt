1
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,750
What should we do, Mi Ya?

2
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,660
We’ve looked everywhere around the bar.

3
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,660
No sign of Beidao.

4
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,620
The bar has been closed for days.

5
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,220
I called him a million times

6
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,420
but he didn’t pick up.

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,240
Others all say he took the money and left.

8
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,820
He wouldn’t do that.

9
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,820
Where was he staying lately?

10
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,020
At the bar.

11
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,940
Other than going to the grocery,

12
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,259
he seldom left.

13
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,979
Did he say

14
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,310
or do anything strange?

15
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,580
Nothing unusual about his words,

16
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,900
but he did play old songs over and over

17
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,340
as if he was reminiscing about the past.

18
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,259
Mi Ya...

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,580
I see. Gotta go.

20
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,620
How did you know I’m here?

21
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,180
I took a guess.

22
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,940
I thought you’d be like this forever

23
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,280
and never see me again.

24
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,620
I thought so at first.

25
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,300
Mi Ya,

26
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,860
thank you.

27
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,340
I should thank you.

28
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,460
Thank me?

29
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,340
Seeing you here

30
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,260
is a relief.

31
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,300
What’s wrong?

32
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,740
Nothing.

33
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,380
Comforting words.

34
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,839
Comforting words?

35
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,320
Lu Weixun’s credibility was being questioned.

36
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,100
Everything about him

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,340
was dug up,

38
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,300
including me writing articles about him

39
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,620
on my public account.

40
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,100
My company was affected

41
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,030
and lost the compensation.

42
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,220
My boss was furious

43
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,080
and asked me to delete my account.

44
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,740
After I did it,

45
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,220
I felt my years of efforts

46
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,350
went down the drain.

47
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,260
You two are reporters?

48
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,430
Reporters with nothing to report.

49
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,340
I accidentally heard you mentioned Lu Weixun.

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,140
Yes.

51
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,420
My customers said something about him.

52
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,740
It seems Rose Winery

53
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,660
isn’t his first winery.

54
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,500
Sorry,

55
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,820
I told the reporters

56
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,190
about Lu Weixun’s double identities.

57
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,860
I thought so.

58
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,740
You did?

59
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,950
Others all assumed it was Mu Chunfeng.

60
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,780
He knew about it long ago.

61
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,860
He wouldn’t wait so long to expose it.

62
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,340
Also,

63
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,220
Mu Chunfeng and I talked about it

64
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,140
at your bar.

65
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,510
How could you be so sure I did it?

66
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
Because of Buzui.

67
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,340
You don’t blame me?

68
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,180
It’s my fault.

69
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,660
I deserve it.

70
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,030
You know I disagree with you

71
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,260
seeking revenge.

72
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,220
I don’t need

73
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,940
anyone’s agreement on that.

74
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,340
Why don’t you and He Buzui

75
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,660
talk everything out?

76
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,340
How could I?

77
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,860
You still won’t quit?

78
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,190
I don’t know.

79
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,260
All I know is

80
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,420
I’m the only one left.

81
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,560
After all these years,

82
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,220
I still can’t

83
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,500
forget about those things.

84
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,700
Mi Ya,

85
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,020
I can’t, I can’t let it go.

86
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,940
I just want a result.

87
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,180
Is that wrong?

88
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,900
Fine.

89
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,540
It’s not wrong.

90
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,220
Don’t wrong a good man

91
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,700
and never let a bad man go.

92
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,980
But

93
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,600
you need to take care of yourself.

94
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,140
Hey, Nanke,

95
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,260
don’t be afraid.

96
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,180
Continue.

97
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,300
People and things come and go

98
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,860
Experienced love and hurt

99
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,460
Pain might be gone

100
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,740
But

101
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,580
The scar is still there

102
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,700
Keep chasing after the desire

103
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,740
It vanished

104
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,300
Can you be yourself again

105
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:23,500
Love is a reality show

106
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,260
People and things come and go

107
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,539
Experienced love and hurt

108
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,980
Pain might be gone

109
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,179
But

110
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,100
The scar is still there

111
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,940
Keep chasing after the desire

112
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,980
It vanished

113
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,580
Can you be yourself again

114
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,660
Why don’t you and He Buzui

115
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,020
talk everything out?

116
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,580
No way.

117
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,340
You still won’t quit?

118
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,540
I can’t, I can’t let it go.

119
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,580
I just want a result.

120
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,220
Hello?

121
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,500
Buzui.

122
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,420
Beidao.

123
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,380
Beidao, help!

124
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,460
Get lost!

125
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,780
Beidao,

126
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,240
my sister is in danger.

127
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,340
Speak.

128
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,700
If I can’t pay off my debts,

129
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,660
they will take my sister.

130
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,700
Don’t you dare lie to me!

131
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,460
I swear

132
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,940
I’m telling the truth.

133
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,830
Who's the creditor?

134
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,620
Some loan shark.

135
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,620
What’s it to do with your sister?

136
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,060
If they can’t catch me,

137
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,780
they’ll go after my sister.

138
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,860
Does she know about this?

139
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,340
Not yet.

140
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,980
That’s why she’s in danger.

141
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,040
They say they’ll take her away today.

142
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,320
Bring me to see the loan shark.

143
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,660
Let's go.

144
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,100
You have company.

145
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,300
So,

146
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,540
is he gonna pay for you?

147
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,540
No money.

148
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,340
Then why are you here?

149
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,340
To mess with me?

150
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,540
Why did he borrow money from you?

151
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,900
Why?

152
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
To gamble.

153
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,260
Who owns the casino?

154
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,860
He owns it.

155
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,620
It’s...

156
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,900
It’s mine. So what?

157
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,100
So he lost money to you,

158
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,070
and then borrowed from you.

159
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,860
If he can’t pay you back, you’ll take his sister.

160
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,140
You came here just to tell me nonsense?

161
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,700
Pay up.

162
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,820
No.

163
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,060
Guys,

164
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,860
kick him out.

165
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,720
Leave him here.

166
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,580
How dare you touch me!

167
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,780
Nice move.

168
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,590
The IOU note.

169
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,500
I don’t have it.

170
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,220
Give me.

171
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,580
Here, here, here.

172
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,940
Beidao,

173
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,300
that was impressive.

174
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,380
Your moves were too fast for me to see clearly.

175
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,860
Hey,

176
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,900
you know kung fu?

177
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Where’s the note?

178
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,460
This?

179
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660
I’ll tear it up.

180
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,660
Now, you owe me.

181
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,020
What?

182
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,860
Beidao,

183
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,220
we’re family.

184
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,660
If my sister knows...

185
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,990
Don’t bother her again.

186
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,540
What?

187
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,900
Come to me.

188
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,180
Beidao...

189
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,200
Sorry for the wait.

190
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,940
It’s OK.

191
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,060
I just arrived.

192
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,180
What’s wrong?

193
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,860
Nothing.

194
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,460
Mi Ya,

195
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,660
you asked me out...

196
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,460
For Yi Beidao.

197
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,700
There are certain things you need to know.

198
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,580
The man who came back

199
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,180
isn’t Yi Beidao.

200
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,900
He’s Yi Nanke,

201
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
Yi Beidao’s twin brother.

202
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,620
Twin brother?

203
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,740
Impossible.

204
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,820
I never heard about him.

205
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,020
- Back in high school...  - In high school,

206
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,820
they shared one identity.

207
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,180
Why?

208
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,200
After their father went missing,

209
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,950
they couldn’t afford to pay for their education.

210
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,820
Yi Nanke

211
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,350
blamed your father for everything happened.

212
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,580
My...my father?

213
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,260
That’s impossible.

214
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,900
What did you think of?

215
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,700
Yi Beidao.

216
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,380
Yi Nanke.

217
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,940
Buzui,

218
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,060
who is this?

219
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,740
Mr. Yi.

220
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,060
Mi...

221
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,020
Missing.

222
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,060
The deputy manager of my father’s winery,

223
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,580
that missing man.

224
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,020
So that’s what happened.

225
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,180
I actually met

226
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,820
two persons back then?

227
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,100
Where’s Yi Beidao?

228
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,700
Where is he?

229
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,480
He passed away 7 years ago.

230
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,380
He died?

231
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,500
What happened back then?

232
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,020
It’s not like what Yi Nanke said, right?

233
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,100
Buzui,

234
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,900
I want you to talk to Yi Beidao.

235
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,140
He and you mean the most to Yi Beidao.

236
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,700
I’m sure he doesn’t want to

237
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
see you like this.

238
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,540
He hates me.

239
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,060
He’d rather see me gone.

240
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,780
There’s nothing I can do.

241
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,140
You should at least know

242
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,460
what really happened.

243
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,220
You’re back.

244
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,700
Dad.

245
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,380
You don’t look well.

246
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
You must be tired.

247
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
I had a lot of work.

248
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,619
Here, have an apple.

249
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,060
Here.

250
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,660
I just peeled it.

251
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,190
Open your mouth.

252
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,660
You look skinny recently.

253
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,220
Do I?

254
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:17,579
Here.

255
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,260
One more.

256
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,780
What do you want for dinner?

257
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
I’ll cook for you.

258
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,380
Dad,

259
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,619
you know...

260
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,900
Sweet and sour ribs.

261
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,340
Fine.

262
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,140
We’ll have ribs.

263
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,180
Take it.

264
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,380
I’ll go buy some ribs.

265
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,340
Be back soon.

266
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,140
OK.

267
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,040
Have some rest.

268
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,500
What happened back then?

269
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,660
Bai Jing,

270
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,420
your work here is done.

271
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,980
You should go back to the WSA.

272
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,540
I don’t want to.

273
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,940
The total lunar eclipse is tonight.

274
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,300
Watch it with me.

275
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,300
I can ask Patrick for a few days off.

276
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,100
Problem solved.

277
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,620
I’m too busy

278
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,820
to be with you.

279
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,150
What about He Buzui?

280
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,760
What about her?

281
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,300
Isn’t she your assistant?

282
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,620
Give your work to her.

283
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,220
I need to handle these things on my own.

284
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,300
I’m your fiancée.

285
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,980
I want your company.

286
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,340
- Also...  - Bai Jing,

287
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,980
stop!

288
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,870
Where are you going?

289
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,640
Emergency.

290
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,140
Mr. Ma will give you a ride.

291
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,340
Once you’re back in France,

292
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,070
bring my greetings to Patrick.

293
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,740
I don’t need a ride.

294
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,780
You like it?

295
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,300
Yeah!

296
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,460
Buzui,

297
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,620
how's your work?

298
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,420
Good.

299
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,580
Buzui, look,

300
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,820
you've recovered

301
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,260
and our life is getting better.

302
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,860
I’m so happy.

303
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,580
Dad,

304
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,180
I saw that old photo in the living room.

305
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,420
Who's that man

306
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,660
next to you?

307
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,540
Yi Jianguo.

308
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,060
Your Uncle Yi.

309
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,220
You know,

310
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,420
he's a capable man.

311
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,620
He helped me a great deal.

312
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,500
Where is he now?

313
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,380
Where is he?

314
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,580
To make Pear Blossom.

315
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,220
The formula is gone,

316
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,180
so is he.

317
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,460
A cursed wine.

318
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,900
It’s cursed, you know?

319
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,700
Forget it.

320
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,820
Let’s eat.

321
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:50,980
Dad,

322
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,940
did you shut down the winery

323
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,820
because the formula is missing?

324
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,060
Buzui,

325
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,940
listen,

326
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,900
no wine

327
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,900
is more important than people, got it?

328
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,940
Hi, Buzui.

329
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,980
Mr. Cui.

330
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,100
Let’s go play.

331
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,220
Isn’t the game tomorrow night?

332
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,300
Changed to tonight.

333
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,030
Gotta fly lanterns tomorrow during the eclipse.

334
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,940
Flying lanterns during the eclipse.

335
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,820
For what?

336
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,340
You can make wishes.

337
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,020
Hurry up, Wangyou. I’ll wait for you outside.

338
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,740
- OK.  - Be quick.

339
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,620
Give me a minute.

340
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,060
Hurry!

341
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,860
Mr. Ma, I don’t need the ride.

342
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,140
I can go there myself.

343
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,860
Mr. Lu ordered me

344
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,540
to escort you to the airport.

345
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,660
Also,

346
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,700
that shows he cares about you.

347
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
Here, let me.

348
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,100
Pen.

349
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,460
Here. Right here.

350
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,100
All done.

351
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,420
This is the last payment.

352
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,760
We’re even.

353
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,140
We are.

354
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
I admire you.

355
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,660
You’re in trouble yourself

356
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,500
and still willing to pay off her debts.

357
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,180
Bravo!

358
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,700
People like you

359
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,940
also read news?

360
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,940
I didn’t get it from the news.

361
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,580
You know,

362
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,980
last time, that chick barged in,

363
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,300
all enraged,

364
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,780
and asked me to give her money back.

365
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,380
How could I do that?

366
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,340
Not in a million years!

367
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,860
She was collecting money for me.

368
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,500
I know.

369
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,340
Why would I give it back?

370
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,380
You know what,

371
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,860
she even tried to beat me.

372
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,700
I had to slap her.

373
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,980
You hit her?

374
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,190
You’re worried?

375
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,380
I was joking.

376
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
I simply drove her out.

377
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,380
How could I hit a girl?

378
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,500
You...you’re leaving?

379
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,580
Take care.

380
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,740
You’re back.

381
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,260
I’ve watered the orchid

382
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,190
and fed the fish.

383
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,180
Files you gave me

384
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,420
have also been sorted out.

385
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,680
They're on your table.

386
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,580
What else do you need me to do?

387
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Fire away.

388
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,420
Thank you for everything.

389
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,820
Are you drunk?

390
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,580
The partial lunar eclipse

391
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,300
will begin around 18:51 Beijing time

392
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,180
on September 30th.

393
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,580
The moon will rise at 19:48,

394
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,100
and then it’ll

395
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,580
enter penumbra.

396
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,380
People will first see

397
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,300
the partial eclipse.

398
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,060
Come.

399
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,220
Let’s go out.

400
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,500
Where are we going?

401
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,430
Somewhere nice.

402
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,020
He Buzui.

403
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,060
This is...

404
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,710
A Kongming lantern.

405
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,020
How did you get this?

406
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,500
A fan gave it to me.

407
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,420
I knew you wouldn’t buy it yourself.

408
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,420
I couldn’t give it back.

409
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,300
Had to take it.

410
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,900
I heard that

411
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,580
wishes made tonight will come true.

412
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,660
I doubt it.

413
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,580
Let’s try.

414
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,480
Did you bring the lighter?

415
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,420
Oh, no,

416
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,220
I forgot.

417
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,460
A lighter is necessary, Mr. Lu.

418
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,380
You have no common sense?

419
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,420
I’ll go buy one.

420
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,100
Wait here.

421
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,100
I’ll go.

422
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,380
Just stay. You’re slow.

423
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,060
I don’t want to miss the time.

424
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,700
OK.

425
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,340
Be careful.

426
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,540
Sir,

427
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,310
may I have a lighter?

428
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,180
Sure.

429
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,060
Hold on.

430
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,020
Matches, please.

431
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,660
Aren’t they the same?

432
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,140
I’m going to fly the lantern.

433
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,380
It feels more pious to use matches.

434
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,060
OK.

435
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,860
Wait a minute.

436
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,990
Few people buy matches now.

437
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,520
I need to look for them.

438
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,100
Sorry for the inconvenience.

439
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,620
It’s OK.

440
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,220
Young lady,

441
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,260
you’re lucky.

442
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,740
My store is here for long.

443
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,540
I bought matches some years ago.

444
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,980
Let me see.

445
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,660
Sir,

446
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,020
this is...

447
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,540
He’s Yi.

448
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,500
He worked for me

449
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,540
a few years ago.

450
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,140
He was nice

451
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,940
but disappeared all of a sudden.

452
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,660
You know him?

453
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,060
Are you still in contact with him?

454
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,420
How is he now?

455
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,100
Not anymore.

456
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,540
But I believe

457
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,980
he’s living a happy life.

458
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,180
That’s good.

459
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,780
He isn’t from a good family

460
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,100
and his younger brother is quite a handful.

461
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,420
I’m worried about him.

462
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,500
Found it.

463
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:03,900
Miss,

464
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,620
you must be in trouble,

465
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,540
so you’re so eager to make the wish.

466
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,860
You’ll be fine.

467
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,020
Let go of the past.

468
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,060
Take the matches as a gift.

469
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,700
Thank you, sir.

470
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,740
Let me know

471
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,340
if you hear from Yi.

472
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,980
OK.

473
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,940
Where did you go?

474
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,980
You didn’t answer your phone.

475
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,180
What took you so long?

476
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,540
I’m sorry.

477
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,900
I ran into a friend

478
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,440
and we chatted for a while.

479
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,460
It's my fault.

480
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,820
Let me light it.

481
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,220
It’s over.

482
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,460
The moon is out.

483
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,180
Ever since you met me,

484
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,140
you seem to have been in bad luck.

485
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,780
I guess so.

486
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,380
Nothing good happened.

487
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,300
You do have a gift.

488
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,220
My gift?

489
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,020
Such as

490
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,740
you can make others feel like hell easily,

491
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,220
and when they're desperate,

492
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,860
they’ll find that it’s not as bad as they think.

493
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,320
There might still be hope.

494
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,780
Making the worst thing look not so bad

495
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,140
is probably your gift.

496
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,700
You’re good enough.

497
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,780
Don’t change yourself

498
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,590
because of others’ judgments.

499
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,500
Never deny yourself

500
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,310
because of anyone or anything.

501
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,020
You mean

502
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,780
I’m good?

503
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,780
Lu Weixun,

504
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,500
thank you for showing up that night.

505
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,230
Here, a toast to you.

506
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,900
Cheers!

507
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,660
Cheers!

508
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,700
So bitter.

509
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,380
Your palate is back!

510
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,080
I’ve lost my palate

511
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,740
since the day I saved you.

512
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,500
What’s happening?

513
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,100
I didn’t notice it's back.

514
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,710
Depression can affect your taste bud.

515
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,380
Oh, I see.

516
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,340
I’m sorry

517
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,140
your palate has to suffer all this.

518
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,460
I am already used to it.

519
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,590
Hey, let’s fly the lantern.

520
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,020
Hope we can find a way

521
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,660
to regain our taste soon!

522
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,940
Again?

523
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,260
Or how could we find the truth?

524
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,940
And all our previous efforts

525
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,020
would be in vain.

526
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,500
How about we try something different?

527
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,780
Like what?

528
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,190
What comes to your mind?

529
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,460
Nothing.

530
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,700
Really?

531
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,820
I guess

532
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,580
we must’ve had special drinks

533
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,300
the night before confronting Mu Chunfeng

534
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,630
that affected our taste

535
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,980
Our taste

536
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,620
at 22:30 on the 23rd.

537
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,460
Then

538
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,020
it stayed for quite some time

539
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,380
till...

540
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,060
till 23:00 on the 27th.

541
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,420
I got it!

542
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,140
It was at Yi Beidao’s bar.

543
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,590
Can physical reasons be the cause?

544
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,860
The doctor once said to me

545
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,980
lack of certain element or psychological factors

546
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,139
could induce taste disorder.

547
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,699
It's called hysterical ageusia.

548
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,100
If that's the case,

549
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,949
special drinks I had these days

550
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,820
must’ve affected my palate.

551
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,139
No change.

552
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,820
Lu Weixun,

553
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,540
is this how you make efforts?

554
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,140
Enhancing your palate

555
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,940
by dopamine and hormone?

556
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,860
Hello?

557
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,540
Mr. Mu,

558
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,460
I’m sorry

559
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,540
but I need to take my apartment back.

560
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,100
May I ask why?

561
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,620
Another client’s offered me twice the money.

562
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,020
That’s a breach of lease.

563
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
Here’s the thing,

564
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,700
that client is willing to

565
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,660
double the penalty

566
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,990
stated in the contract.

567
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,420
This is it?

568
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,940
I won’t give this place to others.

569
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,420
Mr. Mu...

570
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,340
How about this?

571
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,460
The three of us can meet and discuss it.

572
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,590
I’m eager to find out

573
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,980
why someone is willing to

574
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,140
pay such a high price for this place.

575
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,400
Let’s cut to the chase.

576
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,060
I want this apartment

577
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,660
to protect my fiancé from some evil woman.

578
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,500
Miss Bai,

579
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,860
first come, first serve.

580
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,140
Also,

581
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,180
the best way to protect your fiancé

582
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
is to stay at his place, isn’t it?

583
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,070
Why do you have to stay here?

584
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,230
What do you want?

585
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,220
My fiancé and that woman

586
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,980
live across the street.

587
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,460
I need to watch them.

588
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,880
They’re living together?

589
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,540
I can watch them from here.

590
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,420
Watch them?

591
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,300
Miss,

592
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,940
you have a big heart.

593
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,940
I want this place no matter what.

594
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,540
Really?

595
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,420
So do I.

596
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,380
Why?

597
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,380
The truth is,

598
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,980
your fiancé is my biggest opponent.

599
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,310
I also need this place to watch him.

600
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,660
Who are you?

601
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,460
Mu Chunfeng.

602
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,380
It’s you!

603
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,340
My fiancé defeated you.

604
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,600
You’re ill-intentioned.

605
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,420
There’s no way I’ll let you stay here.

606
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,980
Sir,

607
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,940
I’ll pay you triple. Kick him out.

608
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,820
Triple?

609
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,260
I can pay you the same.

610
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,980
Let me make it clear,

611
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,340
I have no ill intentions.

612
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,670
I only want to stay here and find out

613
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,180
what makes him improve so fast.

614
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,540
I can tell you.

615
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,180
Talent.

616
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,060
I disagree.

617
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,060
That’s because you can’t accept your failure.

618
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,100
In my opinion,

619
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,980
that “evil woman” you said is the reason.

620
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,300
Impossible!

621
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,940
According to my observation...

622
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,180
Your observation is wrong.

623
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,260
Then how should I observe?

624
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,180
I can teach you.

625
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:51,900
OK.

626
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,390
In that case,

627
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,420
we can share this apartment

628
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
if you don’t mind.

629
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,350
I’m fine with it.

630
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,660
Fine.

631
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,620
We can share.

632
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,470
We’ve reached an agreement

633
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,140
to share this apartment.

634
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,980
Yes, that’s right.

635
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,580
What?

636
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,540
Cut the crap.

637
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,060
Let’s sign the contract.

638
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,590
Divide this place into two.

639
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,180
Triple price?

640
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,300
Deal.

641
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,060
Young people’s relationships

642
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,780
are confusing.

643
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,260
Who on earth lives across the street?

644
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,260
Don’t catch a cold.

645
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,580
From now on,

646
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,300
we’ll be focusing on replay.

647
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,220
Forget it.

648
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,820
I’m exhausted.

649
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,340
You proposed it.

650
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,780
How come you've changed your mind?

651
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,740
You can’t.

652
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,420
I simply want to kiss...

653
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,520
Never mind.

654
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,900
You don’t understand.

655
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,340
Kiss...kiss what?

656
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,220
I heard it.

657
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,140
No change.

658
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,390
Margarita and Bloody Mary are the only ones left.

659
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,660
Our last choice

660
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,110
is to ask Yi Beidao to mix those two drinks.

661
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,300
No way.

662
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,620
I won't go.

663
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,460
You can’t go either.
