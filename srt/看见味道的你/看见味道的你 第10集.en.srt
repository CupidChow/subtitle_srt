1
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,340
Wait!

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,540
Give me.

3
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,870
You get changed?

4
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,220
Your muscles are good!

5
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,100
My image is ruined by you.

6
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,700
Thank you.

7
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,510
I’m leaving.

8
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,220
What if Lu Weixun found this?

9
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,220
Try to stop him then.

10
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,820
I...

11
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
You wanna

12
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,660
watch over me?

13
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:46,990
He Buzui.

14
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,760
It has been 20 minutes.

15
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,420
Come out now.

16
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,640
Or else, I’ll deduct your salary.

17
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,500
He Buzui!

18
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,940
He Buzui!

19
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,500
Pervert!

20
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,100
Hello, Mr. Lu.

21
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,140
I’m Hao Buzui.

22
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,980
Boring.

23
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,220
Mr. Lu.

24
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,580
Cheers!

25
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,440
Be careful.

26
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,980
Luckily, I am not late.

27
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,740
Here.

28
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,310
It’s specifically for you.

29
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,620
The wine looks like Bloody Mary.

30
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,740
I changed the base wine.

31
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,070
The taste is different.

32
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,660
Give me the same wine.

33
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,460
Lu Weixun!

34
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,980
You come here again!

35
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,540
What on earth do you want?

36
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,860
It’s so good!

37
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,140
The base wine is spirit.

38
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,380
Impressive.

39
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,860
This taste is

40
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,860
familiar to me.

41
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,420
What else did he add?

42
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,380
He also added

43
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,220
lemon, tomato and citronella.

44
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,380
You are so bold.

45
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,580
I’m gonna compete tomorrow.

46
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,100
How dare you have drinks here?

47
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,700
Can’t I have drinks here?

48
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,300
Mr. Lu.

49
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,420
You are not welcomed here.

50
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,820
She is silly, but I’m not.

51
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,240
Go back with me.

52
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
You disobey me?

53
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,060
I don’t wanna go back.

54
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,340
You have to.

55
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,540
Lu Weixun!

56
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,340
Please respect me!

57
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,340
This bottle

58
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,980
is broken.

59
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,800
I can give you a new one.

60
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,620
It is just a bottle.

61
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,300
I will buy a new one for you.

62
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,700
How come you are so mad?

63
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,100
I just want this one!

64
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,540
Are you crazy?

65
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,520
Don’t touch me.

66
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,060
You are bleeding.

67
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,120
Was it given by him?

68
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,940
What do you want?

69
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,580
Lu Weixun!

70
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,100
Beidao!

71
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,380
Don’t fight!

72
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,420
Lu Weixun! Stop!

73
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,220
Get away!

74
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,360
Miss. Are you alright?

75
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,500
Or else, I’m gonna kiss him!

76
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,500
Beidao.

77
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,480
I didn’t do anything with her!

78
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,060
You threaten me!

79
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,620
How dare you threaten me?

80
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,940
Are you insane?

81
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,980
I am not.

82
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,460
I know what I am doing.

83
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,900
Why did you do this?

84
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,540
Because...

85
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,940
Because you are mine.

86
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,580
I have been cooperating with you,

87
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,180
whether in the work

88
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,820
or in life.

89
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
I can do anything you want.

90
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,660
Why did you treat me like this?

91
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,260
He is up to no good.

92
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,940
Can’t you see it?

93
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,020
Beidao is good to me.

94
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,700
I know Beidao

95
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,620
better than you do.

96
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,220
You...

97
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,500
You are a fool!

98
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,740
Yeah.

99
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,740
I’m a fool.

100
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,700
You treat me like this,

101
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,900
but I still

102
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,960
think about the competition for you.

103
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
Did you think about it yourself?

104
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,420
Can you think about the competition?

105
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,460
I feel you’re just thinking about

106
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,700
your schoolmate?

107
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,900
Lu Weixun.

108
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,260
Listen.

109
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,580
You are right.

110
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,140
I have always been thinking about him.

111
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,740
No matter when I have meals

112
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,700
or when I sleep,

113
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,260
I always think about him.

114
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,860
I’m afraid that

115
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,780
he is lonely.

116
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,100
When he stays home alone,

117
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,520
I’m worried about his safety.

118
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,060
I’m afraid he gets drunk

119
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,740
and cries alone in the room.

120
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,380
I’m afraid he is bullied by villains.

121
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,460
He’s gone.

122
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,260
Beidao.

123
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,820
I’m fine.

124
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,780
I know what you said.

125
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,260
It’s late.

126
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,060
Go back now.

127
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,260
Late?

128
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,220
Beidao.

129
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,620
Lu Weixun has gone too far today,

130
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,660
whether to me

131
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,020
or to you.

132
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,100
I apologize to you on his behalf.

133
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,060
But

134
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,940
I have to look for him now.

135
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,820
He has nothing but me.

136
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,780
I’ll explain it to you later.

137
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Schoolmate?

138
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,550
He is more important for you, isn’t it?

139
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,020
Beidao.

140
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,140
Is she your girlfriend?

141
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,380
Go to work.

142
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,460
I’m sorry!

143
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,940
Lu Weixun!

144
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,660
You are proud

145
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,900
of your acute taste.

146
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,140
But there are some tastes that you’ve never tried.

147
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,300
Lu Weixun!

148
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,220
Here.

149
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,900
Try it.

150
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,380
A common but extraordinary delicacy.

151
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,580
Is it good?

152
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,860
Cheap gratification.

153
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,100
It’s cheap and convenient.

154
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,340
A delicacy for ordinary people.

155
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,220
A delicacy for ordinary people?

156
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,100
I’m afraid

157
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,100
I can’t even taste these cheap foods.

158
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,860
But food

159
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,540
can give people happiness.

160
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,820
Happiness given by food?

161
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,300
I didn’t have the sense of taste either.

162
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,540
But I still felt happy

163
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,100
when I ate food.

164
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,780
You can feel the taste of food by tongue.

165
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,870
But the sense of gratification

166
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,740
is from the stomach.

167
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,420
The stomach feels warm,

168
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,420
and you will feel safe.

169
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,000
I didn’t expect

170
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,340
my taste ended

171
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,100
in the instant noodles.

172
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,540
You went too far today.

173
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,820
I hate people threatening me.

174
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,220
You hate so many things.

175
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,620
I know you hate me.

176
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,320
You have self-knowledge.

177
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,100
Now that you hate me,

178
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,430
you can choose to leave.

179
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,980
What?

180
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,230
I won’t compete.

181
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,760
No need to exchange the taste.

182
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,340
I can still be your bodyguard or cook.

183
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,180
Don’t bother.

184
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
There is no chance

185
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,780
to win without taste.

186
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,780
My life is a failure.

187
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,340
I can’t

188
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,860
give you what you want.

189
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,700
You should believe everything will be alright.

190
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,980
I believe you.

191
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,100
I’m not omnipotent.

192
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Not all the things

193
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,060
can go as I wish.

194
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,900
What do you plan to do?

195
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,100
Try to make money.

196
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,060
I have no taste, but I have a smart brain.

197
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,620
I’ll make money and buy the winery back.

198
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,700
It’s half past nine!

199
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,260
So what?

200
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,300
You still have your taste!

201
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,500
I was so scared!

202
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,180
I thought you would definitely lose!

203
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,380
I thought I must leave you!

204
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,460
How come I always have a bad luck?

205
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,380
I paid the instant noodles.

206
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
It’s 13 Yuan with the sausage and pickles.

207
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,100
Time to drink.

208
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,700
Don’t sleep.

209
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,780
Don’t sleep.

210
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,020
What if

211
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,420
my taste is gone when we sleep?

212
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,420
I didn’t sleep.

213
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,060
Buzui!

214
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,220
Buzui!

215
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,620
Come on in!

216
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,620
He Buzui!

217
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,420
Mr. Lu!

218
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,740
I’m coming! Wait a second!

219
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,100
Buzui.

220
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,160
You open the door finally.

221
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,500
Are you ready?

222
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,760
I’m here to pick you up.

223
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,540
Oh, right.

224
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,900
Get up, Lu Weixun!

225
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,740
Are you ready so soon?

226
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,980
Go to prepare yourself.

227
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,860
We’ll be late.

228
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,040
They haven’t come yet.

229
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,820
They are here.

230
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,980
- Mr. Lu!  - Mr. Lu!

231
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,740
We will win it!

232
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,390
- What if...  - We won’t lose.

233
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,620
We will do our best.

234
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,420
Mr. Lu!

235
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,740
You suffered a fiasco last time.

236
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,820
And you come back to challenge it again.

237
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,660
Can you tell me your feelings?

238
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,300
Mr. Lu!

239
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,740
Do you have confidence for the competition?

240
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,300
Mr. Lu!

241
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,620
People said it was a desperate fight.

242
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,820
Do you have any comment on it?

243
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,460
- Mr. Lu!  - Mr. Lu!

244
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,020
Remember it.

245
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,620
Be sure to depict every detail

246
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,020
of Mr. Mu’s performance.

247
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,080
- Remember it.  - OK.

248
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Hello, everyone.

249
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,420
It’s time to cheer

250
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,700
for our idol.

251
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,300
Unafraid of gossips

252
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
and pressure,

253
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,060
our idol will challenge Mu Chunfeng again.

254
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,940
He fights for the faith,

255
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,140
for the honor,

256
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,100
for the spirit of Dionysus.

257
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,340
Lu Weixun is the best!

258
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,220
Lu Weixun will win!

259
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,820
Lu Weixun is the best!

260
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,700
All the best!

261
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,940
- Weixun!  - Weixun!

262
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,940
OK.

263
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,780
- Weixun! - Weixun!

264
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,700
Distinguished guests, friends from media,

265
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,580
This is the live

266
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,460
Popular Sommeliers Competition

267
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,340
of Chinese Wines.

268
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,500
Welcome the domestic professional sommeliers,

269
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,060
Lu Weixun and Mu Chunfeng

270
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,040
for the second blind taste match.

271
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,460
Are you ready?

272
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,940
The competition starts.

273
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
Lu Weixun

274
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,820
performs so well today.

275
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,180
Don’t worry.

276
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,580
It’s just the beginning.

277
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,300
How could I not be worried?

278
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,140
Lu Weixun leads so much.

279
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,180
The result was also

280
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,220
unexpected last time.

281
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,260
What’s wrong with Mr. Mu?

282
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,020
He is off form today.

283
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,900
It’s weird, isn’t it?

284
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,800
He is kinda panicking.

285
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
Well.

286
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,780
Do you have plan B?

287
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,700
Plan B?

288
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,300
I’d like to announce

289
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,220
the winner is

290
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,460
Mr. Lu Weixun.

291
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,060
The king of wine is back!

292
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,300
- Weixun! - Weixun!

293
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,460
Good job!

294
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,940
I deserve it.

295
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,860
Mr. Lu.

296
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,180
It’s said that the stake

297
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,220
is Mu Chunfeng’s Rose Winery.

298
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,900
What do you plan to do with it?

299
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,020
I’ll operate it well.

300
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,580
As a sommelier,

301
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,660
how will you do?

302
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,060
Will you be impartial to operate it?

303
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,800
I hereby announce that

304
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,220
I give up the identity of sommelier.

305
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Mr. Lu Weixun.

306
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,900
You just came back to the pinnacle.

307
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,940
Why do you

308
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,380
make this decision?

309
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,260
Mr. Lu.

310
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,020
You left Lu Group.

311
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,140
Was it related with your mother’s three wineries?

312
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,380
Can you explain it?

313
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,980
Right. Please explain it.

314
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,040
Please explain it.

315
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,900
Whether to be sommelier or to operate the winery,

316
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,820
my aim is always to

317
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,420
protect my mother’s wineries.

318
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,940
Thank you.

319
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,900
Youzhang.

320
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,020
Our family

321
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,180
has kept the same

322
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,680
since you passed away.

323
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,820
Our son

324
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,030
hasn't changed either.

325
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Did you hear that?

326
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,580
It is hot news.

327
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,980
Go back to write article. Hurry up.

328
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,500
- OK.  - Let’s go.

329
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,680
Congratulations!

330
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,700
Lu Weixun.

331
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,620
You are a real talented sommelier.

332
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,500
I lost it.

333
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,140
Do you think I won by talent?

334
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,500
Didn’t you?

335
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,220
Many sommeliers are more talented

336
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,200
and hardworking than you.

337
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:57,420
- Weixun!  - Weixun!

338
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,060
Master.

339
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,190
I watched the competition.

340
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
This matter is over.

341
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,460
I keep my promise

342
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,700
and give you Buck Winery.

343
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,820
Master.

344
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,020
Under the circumstances,

345
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,780
I don’t want to stop here.

346
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,260
My idol was so awesome today.

347
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,260
The rival didn’t get any chance to win.

348
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,620
It’s so exciting!

349
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,100
Though Weixun announced

350
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,160
to give up the identity of sommelier,

351
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,680
it doesn’t matter.

352
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,940
His legend will be widely spread

353
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,660
in the community.

354
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,500
Right?

355
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,860
Right!

356
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,460
So,

357
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,300
we should drink and celebrate it.

358
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,460
Right?

359
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,980
Right!

360
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,160
Lu Weixun. Shall we drink?

361
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,580
We are so happy today.

362
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,500
OK.

363
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,580
How about we go to

364
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,500
a new bar?

365
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,380
The boss is my friend.

366
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,100
Your... Your friend?

367
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,260
Let’s go!

368
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,740
Beidao!

369
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,140
We triumphed!

370
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,350
Listen to me.

371
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,060
My idol was very awesome today.

372
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,420
The rival didn’t get any chance to win.

373
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,020
It was so exciting!

374
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,060
Though he announced

375
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,120
to give up the identity of sommelier,

376
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,280
it doesn’t matter.

377
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,420
His legend will be widely spread in the community.

378
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,980
Your wines are on me!

379
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,660
All of you!

380
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,620
Beidao!

381
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,700
This is my idol.

382
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,540
Isn’t he handsome?

383
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,780
Beidao.

384
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,740
Bai.

385
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,310
Take care of guests.

386
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,860
This way, please.

387
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,860
Thank you.

388
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,860
I treat you tonight.

389
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,670
What would you like to have?

390
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,660
Weixun.

391
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,740
All the wines are on you?

392
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,750
I’m happy today.

393
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,280
You can have any wines.

394
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,700
Any wines?

395
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,780
I want...

396
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,740
All of the wines.

397
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,670
All of the wines?

398
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,820
Some wines are very strong.

399
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,420
It doesn’t matter.

400
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,100
OK.

401
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,740
He Buzui.

402
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,660
Do you wanna get drunk?

403
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,540
No, she won’t get drunk.

404
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,460
You must be kidding.

405
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,060
She ever drunk up

406
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,220
half of my wines in the cellar.

407
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,540
Is He Buzui

408
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,580
the legend who won’t get drunk?

409
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,820
I am drinking with a legend!

410
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
- He Buzui! I admire you!  - Let her go!

411
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,380
I’m going to the washroom.

412
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,110
Beidao. Give me a drink.

413
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,580
Weixun. Please autograph it for me!

414
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,860
Do it for me first!

415
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,860
Have a rest here.

416
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,460
What’s wrong?

417
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,179
Go to check it.

418
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:50,739
He Buzui!

419
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,340
He Buzui!

420
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,940
He Buzui!

421
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,860
The phone!

422
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,340
Little rabbit

423
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,940
Open the door

424
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,260
Hurry up

425
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,180
Let me come in

426
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,780
I won’t open the door

427
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,620
Mom hasn’t come back

428
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,060
I won’t open for anyone

429
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,660
Turn on the light.

430
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,020
Anyone here?

431
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,140
It’s fine.

432
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,260
Fine.

433
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,540
It’s fine.

434
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,860
Beidao! Turn on the light, please.

435
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,780
Is it dark?

436
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,140
It’s fine.

437
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,470
It’s fine. I’m here.

438
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,070
Are you alright?

439
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,380
Thank you, Beidao.

440
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,460
Let’s go.

441
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,180
Don’t hold me. I’m not drunk.

442
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,940
I love Lu Weixun! I love Lu Weixun!

443
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,780
Take care!

444
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,260
Do you love her?

445
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,820
I came here for her.

446
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,900
I mean,

447
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,000
do you really love her?

448
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,220
Do I have to answer you?

449
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,300
It has nothing to do with you.

450
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,660
Beidao.

451
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
We’re leaving.

452
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,020
Take care.

453
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,180
Beidao.

454
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,780
That day, I left

455
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,100
because...

456
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,260
It doesn’t matter.

457
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
I understand you.

458
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,180
I’ll settle all the matters.

459
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,860
Rest assured.

460
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,580
Take care.

461
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,060
Hey.

462
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,440
How can you don’t look happy for your win?

463
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,860
Lu Weixun.

464
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,980
I want...

465
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,940
Talk to me tomorrow.

466
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,300
You know.

467
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,580
Our tastes have recovered.

468
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,720
And you also won the competition.

469
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,120
How about we terminate the contract?

470
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,940
OK.

471
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,100
I agree.
