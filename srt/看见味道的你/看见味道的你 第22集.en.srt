1
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,979
Mr. Wan.

2
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Do you know

3
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,020
someone was buried here?

4
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,580
Chap.

5
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,820
Don’t talk nonsense.

6
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,740
This is the evidence.

7
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,620
Collect it.

8
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,340
Whether it’s true or not,

9
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,820
the police will investigate it.

10
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,620
Don’t leave

11
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,380
before we figure it out.

12
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,980
All of you go to the police station

13
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,460
to make a record.

14
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,620
We’re doomed.

15
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,220
Wake up.

16
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,660
Where was the spade from?

17
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,620
You asked me the question just now.

18
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,060
The warehouse

19
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,420
has a backyard.

20
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,100
There is a mound of earth in the yard.

21
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,660
There is a small house beside the mound.

22
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,420
And there are a spade and a hoe

23
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,620
beside the house.

24
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,420
How long

25
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,020
will the record take?

26
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,700
It depends.

27
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,900
It involves a man lost twenty years ago.

28
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
The information is complicated.

29
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,140
My colleagues are collecting evidence on site.

30
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,140
It may

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,940
take a long time to finish it.

32
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,300
Can I make a call?

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,860
No, you can’t.

34
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,820
Wait a while.

35
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,540
He Buzui.

36
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
He Buzui.

37
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,540
What’s wrong?

38
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,660
The contests are about to begin.

39
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,500
She doesn’t answer me.

40
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,180
How about using the key card?

41
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,700
Hello.

42
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,300
Yi Nanke and I

43
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,940
found his father’s corpse.

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,020
We are making a record in the police station.

45
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,700
Can the contests be delayed?

46
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,180
Be careful then.

47
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,180
I can do it alone.

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,980
Rest assured.

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,140
Bye.

50
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,980
How is it?

51
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,930
Will you compete?

52
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,180
Yes.

53
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,460
OK.

54
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,780
Mr. Lu.

55
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,540
Where is your partner?

56
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,700
She has something else to do.

57
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,740
You are versus the two of them.

58
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,460
It’s not fair.

59
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,300
Yeah.

60
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,180
It should be one versus one.

61
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,420
Well, I won’t take part in the final contest.

62
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,740
Mr. Lu.

63
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,060
Do you agree with it?

64
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,020
Yes.

65
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,700
Mr. Lu, please have a rest nearby.

66
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,660
The third contest.

67
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,860
It is still the blind taste you are familiar with.

68
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,900
Only one glass of wine.

69
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,940
After you taste it,

70
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,060
please write down relevant information.

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,340
The one who writes more will be the winner.

72
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,100
Got it?

73
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
You ready?

74
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,420
- Yes.  - Yes.

75
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,300
Ready?

76
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,460
Go.

77
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,380
You look upset.

78
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,420
You can’t tell other wines understandably.

79
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,820
But how come you can’t tell this wine?

80
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
What do you mean?

81
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,060
You do lose the sense,

82
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,060
but you shouldn’t

83
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,340
forget this taste.

84
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,380
Weixun.

85
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,620
Wine brewing has something to do with fate.

86
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,340
Fate?

87
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Yeast is

88
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,340
a creature of great vitality.

89
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,740
Even if you don’t do anything,

90
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,060
fruits will ferment slowly

91
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,740
in the natural environment.

92
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,700
Will it rot?

93
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,220
Yes, it will.

94
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,580
It will rot in a wrong environment.

95
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,620
So, we should do our part well.

96
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,660
Do our part?

97
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,980
It means

98
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,660
to do your work well first.

99
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,140
Listen.

100
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,260
Firstly, the raw materials

101
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,020
should be clean.

102
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,580
Only clean grapes

103
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,540
have sound yeast.

104
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
Why not use the yeasts

105
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,540
cultured in the laboratory?

106
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,620
Those yeasts are stronger.

107
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,620
Good question.

108
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,700
You know.

109
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,980
Each kind of yeasts has its own characteristics.

110
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,460
If a winery carries out

111
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,980
a long-term natural fermentation,

112
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,220
the winery can culture

113
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,540
its unique yeast population in the air,

114
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,620
and bring a distinctive flavor to the wine.

115
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,820
Are the tastes different?

116
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,900
Yes, they are different.

117
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,660
Among thousands of wines,

118
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,580
you will be able to distinguish

119
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,900
the effect of natural yeasts

120
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,100
and the commercial yeasts on the wine.

121
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,860
You should continuously try

122
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,500
until you find your favorite taste.

123
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,220
Don’t worry.

124
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,220
When you grow up

125
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,100
and taste various wines in the world,

126
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,780
you will understand it.

127
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,220
I’m looking forward to it.

128
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,420
I want to know

129
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,940
there are how many tastes of wines.

130
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,300
Don’t forget

131
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,980
to take me with you.

132
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,740
Pinkie promise!

133
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,580
Pinkie promise!

134
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,220
Remember.

135
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
The yeast which you find

136
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,860
only belongs to us.

137
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,860
Why do you do this?

138
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,100
It’s 9 o’clock. Hurry up.

139
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,220
I’m gonna be late.

140
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,220
Buzui.

141
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,420
Mr. Wan.

142
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,820
I’m going to the hotel too.

143
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,620
Let me give you a ride.

144
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,780
No need.

145
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,100
I will drive her.

146
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,900
Mr. Wan.

147
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,700
I’m leaving.

148
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,820
I have something to do.

149
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,460
Did Mr. Wan

150
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,220
work in the winery before?

151
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,780
Yes.

152
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,940
He was the partner of the winery back then.

153
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,740
To treat my illness,

154
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,980
my dad sold the winery

155
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,700
under Mr. Wan’s help.

156
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,540
Is it just a coincidence?

157
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,140
Excellent.

158
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,140
Your cards combined

159
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,380
are all the answers.

160
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,940
You didn’t write the taste that Mr. Lu sensed.

161
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,900
But you wrote more wine information.

162
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,700
Mr. Lu only wrote one answer.

163
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,300
So,

164
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,660
the winner of the contest is Mu Chunfeng.

165
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,140
Well.

166
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,860
All the contests are over.

167
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
You won two contests

168
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
of the three.

169
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,060
So,

170
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,420
the final winners are Lu Linong and Mu Chunfeng.

171
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,700
Congratulations!

172
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,780
Congratulations.

173
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,260
Buck Winery is yours.

174
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,620
Thank you, sir.

175
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,180
Congratulations!

176
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,380
Though you lost the sense of taste,

177
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,460
you recognized the flavor which I can’t do.

178
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,620
Lu Weixun.

179
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,340
I admire you.

180
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,460
So do I.

181
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,460
Don’t you feel angry that I won Buck Winery?

182
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,860
You won the contests.

183
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,700
I lost.

184
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,020
And,

185
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,340
you will operate it well, won’t you?

186
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,660
Mr. Lu.

187
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Don’t be upset.

188
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,020
Though you failed,

189
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,140
I believe in your ability and talent.

190
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,540
Good luck.

191
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,820
Thank you.

192
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,660
Goodbye.

193
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,220
Sorry.

194
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,580
I’m late.

195
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,620
Was the competition over?

196
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,780
Yes.

197
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,980
Did you lose?

198
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,580
Yes.

199
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,740
But I gained something else.

200
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,740
What about you?

201
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,980
I...

202
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I gained something too.

203
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,580
But I handed it over to the police.

204
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,060
It’s good that you came here.

205
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,580
But I came late.

206
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,060
The competition is over.

207
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,820
It doesn’t matter.

208
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,780
There are always wins or loses.

209
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,780
Right?

210
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,619
What should we do then?

211
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,100
I'm gonna visit my dad tonight.

212
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,500
Don’t worry.

213
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,780
Hello. I’m gonna sit here.

214
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,500
Hello.

215
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,020
Boss. A bottle of beer, please.

216
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,860
OK.

217
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,340
I’ll have yours.

218
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,220
Suit yourself.

219
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,620
Thanks.

220
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,580
It’s the same as

221
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,180
the first time we met.

222
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Seems it happened yesterday.

223
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,140
Also seems it happened long time ago.

224
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,180
Let me ask you.

225
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,980
Why did you sigh?

226
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,940
How is he?

227
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,020
I don’t know.

228
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,260
But I don’t think

229
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,700
he is well.

230
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,500
What’s wrong with him?

231
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,740
We found his father’s wedding ring

232
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,140
in the ruins of the winery.

233
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,900
Maybe the matter

234
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,820
isn’t as simple as we thought.

235
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,620
No wonder he can’t let it go.

236
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,540
I shouldn’t persuade him to let it go.

237
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,820
How could he let it go?

238
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,740
Mi Ya.

239
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,980
Do you know what he said to me?

240
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,220
He said

241
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,460
he loathed me,

242
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,900
and didn’t want to see me again.

243
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,500
He asked me to leave.

244
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,620
I think he was afraid to lose you.

245
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,500
He was afraid to lose you,

246
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,660
so he drove you away.

247
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,420
He drove me away

248
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,300
because he didn’t need me.

249
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,060
Stop talking about me.

250
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,540
Tell me.

251
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,580
Why did you sigh?

252
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,020
Because Lu Weixun lost his winery, right?

253
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,060
Do you know it?

254
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,540
I was late for the contests.

255
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,140
If I hadn’t gotten there late...

256
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,980
If you hadn’t gotten there late,

257
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,500
Lu Weixun wouldn’t

258
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,060
have lost the contests.

259
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,500
But,

260
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,060
if Lu Weixun hadn’t lost,

261
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,620
his father couldn’t have known

262
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,180
his son is so obsessed with wines.

263
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,060
Mu Chunfeng said that.

264
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,460
You,

265
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,180
don’t bring troubles to yourself.

266
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,900
You are

267
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,860
troubled by love. It’s not your style.

268
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,420
Now that you miss him, why not go to him?

269
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,700
Little girl.

270
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,700
Do you think you know everything?

271
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,260
I don’t know things,

272
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,660
so I’m trying to figure it out.

273
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,140
You old woman,

274
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,740
it’s more worrisome to drink wine.

275
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,820
It’s in vain to evade it.

276
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,620
Don’t prod me. It doesn’t work.

277
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,980
Isn’t it effective to you?

278
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,260
The supper is on me.

279
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,260
Why did you send me the message?

280
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,660
What?

281
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,900
Would you send message to me?

282
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,220
It would be a long time to wait.

283
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
Not really.

284
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,900
I have been thinking to send you messages.

285
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,900
Finally, the message was sent by me.

286
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,100
Well.

287
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,940
Do you still think you are a loser?

288
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,740
Loser or not,

289
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,460
I should still go on with the life.

290
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,540
You are right.

291
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,500
Maybe it isn’t

292
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,780
as bad as you thought.

293
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,220
Maybe the ring

294
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,020
was just a coincidence.

295
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,860
Maybe we can find your dad.

296
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,300
Hello.

297
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,500
Is it Yi Nanke?

298
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,420
This is Liu in charge of your case.

299
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,660
Come to the police station now.

300
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,220
OK.

301
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,060
Come with me.

302
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,540
We haven’t had dinner together for a long time.

303
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,940
I lost.

304
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,620
I will do as you wish.

305
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
No need.

306
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,580
Do what you want to do.

307
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,700
Weixun.

308
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,660
Where’s dad?

309
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,180
Mom. He’s arriving soon.

310
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,740
Don’t go to sleep. Please wait for him.

311
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
Weixun.

312
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,740
Remember to water the orchids at home.

313
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,860
But don’t soak the roots in water.

314
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,380
It’s the most important to protect the roots.

315
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Mom. Don’t talk.

316
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,380
Weixun.

317
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,180
You are a talented boy.

318
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,220
Do what you like to do in the future.

319
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,100
Sorry.

320
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,660
I can’t accompany you anymore.

321
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,380
Mom!

322
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,780
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

323
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,140
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

324
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,980
Mom!

325
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,260
Mom!

326
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,620
Mom!

327
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,020
You were late!

328
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,420
Did you finish your deal?

329
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,820
Tell me!

330
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,500
My mom had been waiting for you.

331
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,340
Do you love mom?

332
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,180
Of course.

333
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,500
She is the love of my life.

334
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,660
How could you

335
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,460
get the wines withered in the winery?

336
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
How could you sell her winery?

337
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,980
I have things I don’t want to face.

338
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,660
I supported

339
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,380
your mom’s winery.

340
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,660
After she passed away,

341
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,020
no one operated it.

342
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,180
It took a big price

343
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
for the cost recovery.

344
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,700
You know

345
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,660
your mom didn’t want to commercialize it.

346
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,500
She loved the natural brewing

347
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,300
as you do.

348
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,100
Rather than the winery was deserted,

349
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,300
I sold it to someone who can operate it well.

350
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,780
You can do what you want to do.

351
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,380
But freedom comes at a price.

352
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,940
You have to take the responsibility.

353
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,460
Of course.

354
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,780
That’s good.

355
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,180
I hope you choose the right way.

356
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,940
It’s not the end.

357
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,700
There is no right or wrong.

358
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,580
What your mom said was right.

359
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,380
What did she say?

360
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,340
She said

361
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,660
you were like me.

362
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,780
Maybe.

363
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,700
But more often than not,

364
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,100
I’m not like you.

365
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,940
Oh, right.

366
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,940
Are you dating the girl from He Wine Distillery?

367
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,580
Do you know He Wine Distillery?

368
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,380
Your mom loved Pear Blossom

369
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,700
from He Wine Distillery.

370
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,620
It should be mom’s favorite flavour.

371
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,420
Right.

372
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,740
Are there wines in Buck Winery?

373
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,060
Yes.

374
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,460
You can get some at any time.

375
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,740
Is it good?

376
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Frankly,

377
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,020
I can’t sense the taste at all.

378
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,100
But,

379
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,300
I can get something else.

380
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,660
The pictures in the past?

381
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,300
You haven’t talked to dad like that

382
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,340
for a long time, right?

383
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,540
Yeah.

384
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
How did you feel?

385
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,780
Like the wine,

386
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
I don’t feel anything.

387
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,220
But,

388
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,460
it’s not bad.

389
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,940
Alright.

390
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,220
I feel relieved to hear that.

391
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,580
Congratulations, Lu Weixun. You’ve grown up.

392
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,060
Finally, I can go back.

393
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,420
Where to go?

394
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,700
To your memory.

395
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,340
Mr. Wan.

396
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,420
Last night,

397
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,340
the police dug out the corpse at Warehouse No. 9.

398
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
Yi Nanke went to identify the corpse.

399
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,740
It was Yi Jianguo.

400
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,660
You...

401
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,460
Do you have questions?

402
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,860
Mr. Wan.

403
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,060
Did you know it before?

404
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,180
No, I didn’t.

405
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,500
I’m surprised too.

406
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,210
Now that it happens,

407
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,020
don’t do anything

408
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,780
to Yi Nanke and He Buzui.

409
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,100
Don’t make any trouble.

410
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,580
Yes.

411
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
How is Zeze?

412
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,500
Not good.

413
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,860
Zeze seems to find something.

414
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,690
Keep an eye on him.

415
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,020
Tell him.

416
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,130
I’m gonna see him later.

417
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,940
Yes.

418
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,100
Leave.

419
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,500
How come you can move so many steps at once?

420
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,660
I only took one step just now.

421
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,380
Because my piece was queen.

422
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,980
Your piece is king.

423
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,780
Why can queen take many steps at once

424
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
while the king can only move one step?

425
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,900
Because...

426
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,820
Because

427
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,380
girls like going shopping.

428
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,500
I don’t care.

429
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
My king can move many steps.

430
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,660
The rule is that the king moves one step once.

431
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,220
My king is shopping with the queen.

432
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,900
So, he takes the same steps as the queen.

433
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,140
You don’t follow rules.

434
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,980
Will you accompany me when I go shopping?

435
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,740
Yes.

436
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,060
That’s it.

437
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,300
I’m opening the door.

438
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Hello. What are you doing?

439
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,940
Playing chess.

440
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,940
You must be good at chess.

441
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,900
I want to broadcast it live.

442
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,300
Put it back.

443
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,740
You are not allowed to do so.

444
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,580
Alright.

445
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,540
Why did you come here?

446
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,980
I come here to see you.

447
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,220
I heard that you lost your winery.

448
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,060
We are your fans.

449
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,860
You need us to stay with you

450
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,340
support, encourage

451
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,300
and cheer you up.

452
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,180
Idol

453
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,700
We hope you can

454
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
face the loss,

455
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,260
and forget it from now on.

456
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,660
It sounds like a pyramid scheme.

457
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,780
I see.

458
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,220
I appreciate it.

459
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,940
You can go now.

460
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,700
Idol. Don’t drive me away!

461
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,580
Don’t feel upset!

462
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,700
I’m always at your side.

463
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,820
I...

464
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,300
I’m gonna go shopping with my girlfriend.

465
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,300
We were playing chess.

466
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,740
Do you want to go shopping?

467
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,900
You talked about going shopping

468
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,780
while we were playing chess.

469
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,660
Didn’t you want me

470
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,740
to go shopping with you?

471
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,100
It’s rare to see my idol show love towards his girlfriend.

472
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,020
Let me.

473
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,140
How come so many people come to our home?

474
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,300
You bastard! What do you want?

475
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,500
Thanks for your kindness.

476
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,740
I had a good time these days.

477
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,540
You pervert!

478
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,260
When you do personal business,

479
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,340
remember to draw the curtains.

480
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,980
No drinks in the refrigerant.

481
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,780
What would you like to drink? I’m gonna buy it.

482
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,660
Whatever.

483
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,340
Thank you.

484
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,260
You’re welcome.

485
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,740
I want cola,

486
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,860
and crisps.

487
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,860
Don’t stay here. Go with me.

488
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Be careful.

489
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,060
I’m going back to the winery.

490
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,740
You are capable.

491
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,580
I count on you for Buck Winery.

492
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,260
I heard that you wouldn’t go back to Lu Group.

493
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,740
You lost your sense of taste.

494
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,500
What will you do?

495
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,140
Just like now.

496
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,540
I don’t think I’ve lost anything.

497
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,900
Instead,

498
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,540
I gain more from it.

499
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,420
We left Weixun at home alone.

500
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,220
What if he is bullied by Mu Chunfeng?

501
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,300
And

502
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,500
it’s raining.

503
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,060
Why do we go to the market?

504
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,020
To buy some vegetables.

505
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,740
Will you cook tonight?

506
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,380
Yes, I will.

507
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,860
With my idol?

508
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,420
Yes.

509
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,620
I’m gonna have dinner with you.

510
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,540
Give it to me.

511
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,260
It’s heavy.

512
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,380
Good boy.

513
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,740
Ms. He, Mr. Lu wants to see you.

514
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,540
Who are you?

515
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,460
Mr. Lu?

516
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,380
Who is Mr. Lu?

517
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
I only know

518
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,660
my idol Mr. Lu.

519
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,060
If you don’t make it clear,

520
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,980
I will call the police.

521
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,260
Mr. Lu Linong, the chairman of Lu Group.
