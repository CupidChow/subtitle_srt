1
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,940
I’m

2
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,420
back?

3
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,020
He’s back.

4
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,579
Beidao.

5
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,020
Hey, Miss.

6
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,500
Yes. You.

7
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,100
Come and do me a favor.

8
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,620
Coming.

9
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,260
You’re He Buzui, aren’t you?

10
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,400
I hear your family had a winery before

11
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,560
but it went out of business later.

12
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,900
I even hear that someone died

13
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,140
and trouble was stirred up at their house.

14
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,020
Nonsense.

15
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,720
Nobody died because of us.

16
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,780
My dad closed the winery

17
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,140
because I was ill and needed to be cured.

18
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,060
You’re ill?

19
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,060
Beat it. Stay away from me.

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,250
You carry germs.

21
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,700
Yes,

22
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,140
I’m ill.

23
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,940
I’m even infectious.

24
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,640
Don’t bully her again.

25
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,020
You can turn to me if you’re bullied again.

26
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,420
Class Eight, Senior Two.

27
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,260
Yi Beidao.

28
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,460
You’re back?

29
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,940
When did you get back?

30
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,339
Where are you now?

31
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,340
Boss,

32
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,860
if there is anything,

33
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,240
I’ll get back to sleep.

34
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,260
I had a sleepless last night

35
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,060
and now I’m too sleepy.

36
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,300
Get up.

37
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,900
Get up!

38
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,980
Make it clear.

39
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,940
What’s going on downstairs?

40
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,660
What?

41
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,500
The flavorings, snacks,

42
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,740
pots and pans, my fish

43
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,300
and that cat.

44
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,380
I couldn’t sleep last night.

45
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
Originally I wanted to chat with you

46
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,260
but you had been asleep

47
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,980
so I didn’t disturb you.

48
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,500
I bought those snacks.

49
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,100
You always have to work so hard

50
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,100
and stay up late. Surely you’ll be hungry.

51
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,660
We can eat them together.

52
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,220
It’s my treat.

53
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
But if you insist on reimbursing me,

54
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,980
I’ll not reject it

55
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,140
I’m still keeping the invoice.

56
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,660
I never eat junk food

57
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,060
and I don’t allow you to eat them.

58
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,190
Throw them all away.

59
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,700
Fine.

60
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,820
You know what?

61
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,460
I’m a good cook.

62
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,840
I was hungry last night

63
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,260
and made myself noodles.

64
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,910
If you’re worrying,

65
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,700
I can prepare a meal for you.

66
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,500
I’ve bought the flavorings, anyway.

67
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:11,980
You just need to

68
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,900
pay me for cooking.

69
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,940
I’m afraid I’ll be poisoned by you.

70
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,260
Sure,

71
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,740
it’s not weird for hateful people

72
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,500
like you to be poisoned.

73
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,480
What about the cat?

74
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,140
The cat?

75
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,780
Last night it kept pushing the door and meowing.

76
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,660
It was cold and hungry

77
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,140
so I took it home.

78
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,980
You pitied a stray cat.

79
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,670
What about the fish in my aquarium?

80
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,020
Why should they be eaten by a wild cat?

81
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,700
The cat ate your fish?

82
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,620
Do you have any evidence?

83
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,660
It’s a cat.

84
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,860
Do you have any common sense?

85
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,420
It’s the cat’s fault.

86
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,700
You can educate it.

87
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,580
I order you to get rid of it

88
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,190
within twenty-four hours.

89
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,940
Besides,

90
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,220
clean up

91
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,820
this mess

92
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,100
in your room.

93
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,560
Turn off the lights before you sleep.

94
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,340
I can do anything except that.

95
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,340
I can’t fall asleep without the lights on.

96
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,340
I’m afraid of darkness.

97
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,060
You’ll be afraid, too?

98
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,740
I thought you were the reincarnation of a superwoman.

99
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,240
It doesn’t matter if I can’t have a good rest.

100
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,700
If your sense of taste is affected,

101
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,500
that’s really bad.

102
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,440
The electricity bill will be deducted from your salaries.

103
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,020
The richer, the meaner.

104
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,780
You got a pimple.

105
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,620
I got lots of problems after I met you.

106
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,700
If you weren’t a fool,

107
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,740
I would think that you were sent by my dad.

108
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,020
How come I’m a fool?

109
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,860
You didn’t know you’re a fool.

110
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,900
That’s really confusing.

111
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,100
Such a bad temper.

112
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,400
If you don’t have pimples, no one should.

113
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,900
Clean these up and go downstairs.

114
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,580
Quickly.

115
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,540
Okay,

116
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,980
Pimple.

117
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,900
Clean up my house right now.

118
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,940
Finally there was a big move among sommeliers

119
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,940
who haven’t made the headlines for a long time.

120
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,780
The learned and famous sommelier,

121
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,620
Mu Chunfeng,

122
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,160
threw down the gauntlet to

123
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,220
the sommelier of genius, Lu Weixun, without any warning.

124
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,500
Lu Weixun hasn’t responded to it yet.

125
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,190
We’ll follow up this matter

126
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,500
and continuously report on it.

127
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Now let’s ask for the fans’ opinion.

128
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,340
It doesn’t deserve to be talked about.

129
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,400
Mu Chunfeng just wants to be popular.

130
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,900
He’s stealing the spotlight

131
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,830
and we hate this behavior the most.

132
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you think Lu Weixun will pick up the gauntlet?

133
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,080
You can never tell.

134
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
He’s an eccentric man.

135
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,100
Lu Weixun only signed contract

136
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,300
with our magazine.

137
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,920
If he wins,

138
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,090
that’s naturally favorable to us.

139
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
What if he loses?

140
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,920
Lu Weixun has absolute sense of taste.

141
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Why should he be afraid?

142
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,280
He should confront directly

143
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,400
if he’s a man.

144
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,040
Lu Weixun won’t lose

145
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,160
but he doesn’t need to pick up the gauntlet either.

146
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,330
What does she mean, Zhuzhu?

147
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,120
What’s this?

148
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,580
-It looks...  -Put it down.

149
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,660
You’re not allowed to eat spicy food now.

150
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,160
But I like it.

151
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,880
Quit it.

152
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,800
Why?

153
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,540
Quit it.

154
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,280
Tyrant.

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Miss He,

156
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,940
did I employ you to enjoy yourself?

157
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,660
We only have three chances to exchange our senses of taste

158
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,340
and I have plenty of work to do.

159
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,940
I need you to do all you can to cooperate with me.

160
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,240
You want me to be a plug-in of your sense of taste.

161
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,980
A plug-in?

162
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,260
You’re at best a container.

163
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,440
I think this matter...

164
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,060
I’ll make arrangements as quickly as possible.

165
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,080
You want to talk about Lu Weixun with me?

166
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,200
Yes.

167
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,090
I want your opinion.

168
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,360
My opinion?

169
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,090
I’m responsible for his drafts

170
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,160
but not for him.

171
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,100
I won’t know if he’ll accept

172
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,500
Mu Chunfeng’s challenge.

173
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,560
Lu Weixun has been in this profession for years

174
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,000
but he only writes a column for our magazine.

175
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,120
Currently,

176
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,760
you may be the only person who can talk him round

177
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,280
or handle him in the circles.

178
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,210
He has kicked out

179
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,000
five veteran editors before you.

180
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,620
In other words,

181
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,420
he always keeps a low profile.

182
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,440
This column

183
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,440
is his only contact with the circles

184
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,320
and probably

185
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,890
you’re his only friend.

186
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,480
I’m not too wrong by saying so, am I?

187
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,280
Friend?

188
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,440
Lu Weixun doesn’t have friends.

189
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,400
He can’t be friends with me either.

190
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,960
If you want me to persuade him into accepting the challenge,

191
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,220
that’s out of my reach.

192
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,660
Now taste them.

193
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,640
So many delicious things.

194
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,240
Which one should I eat first?

195
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,040
It’s good.

196
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
How does it taste?

197
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,240
Sweet.

198
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,160
Sweet?

199
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,290
What kind of sugar is it?

200
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,930
According to the degree of sweetness,

201
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,240
sugars alone

202
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,890
are divided into fructose,

203
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,120
glucose,

204
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,600
maltose

205
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,970
and sucrose.

206
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Sucrose

207
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,440
is divided into light brown sugar,

208
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
dark brown sugar,

209
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,840
white sugar,

210
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,560
rock candy

211
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,260
and sugar lump.

212
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,820
Through a variety of processing, different materials

213
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,050
are made into different foods.

214
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,720
For example,

215
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,400
Swiss sugar,

216
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,400
fruit candy,

217
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,840
caramel,

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,840
peanut brittle,

219
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,600
sesame seed candy,

220
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,560
peppermint,

221
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,840
lollipop,

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,480
marshmallow, crisp candy and toffee.

223
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,040
There are so many kinds of candies already,

224
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,400
not to mention other complicated food.

225
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,000
There are no

226
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
absolute short cuts to master them.

227
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,380
You can only work hard and memorize them.

228
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,140
Today you’ll memorize the tastes of these candies.

229
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,720
Mr. Lu,

230
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
can we take a progressive approach?

231
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,360
If you want me to memorize all these tastes,

232
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,560
roughly I’ll need

233
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,720
one week.

234
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
That only shows that you’re stupid.

235
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
You must memorize them today.

236
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But I need to do something tonight.

237
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
If I memorize all of them,

238
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,760
can I go out?

239
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,730
There’s no absolute freedom.

240
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,240
Freedom is bound up with restriction.

241
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,400
What do you mean?

242
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,609
Stay here until you memorize them.

243
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,480
Doctor Wine is ranked number one

244
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
in its industry

245
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,560
while Lu Weixun is a sommelier of genius

246
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,920
who has absolute sense of taste.

247
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,160
It’s collaboration between the strong.

248
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,890
Our status is indestructible.

249
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,340
If he takes up this challenge and wins,

250
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,540
that will be the icing on the cake.

251
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,520
But if he loses, that will be irremediable.

252
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
You always play it safe.

253
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,100
I really can’t figure out

254
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,700
why you want him to gamble with his reputation.

255
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
Will Lu Weixun lose?

256
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
I don’t dare to guarantee that he’ll win

257
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,460
but I’ll try not to let our magazine lose.

258
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,120
Mia

259
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,280
even if we won’t lose our status in the industry,

260
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,520
our magazine still needs the icing on the cake.

261
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,560
I’ll be careful.

262
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,680
Oh, my throat.

263
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,420
It’s not easy to be a container, isn’t it?

264
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,040
Are you going out?

265
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,080
Have you memorized them?

266
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
I’m starving.

267
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,600
I’ve been tasting them all day.

268
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,720
My brain, my throat and my stomach

269
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,200
are stuffed with sugar.

270
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,680
Your stomach works better than your brain.

271
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,800
Hunger will affect my judgement of taste.

272
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,400
I’m considering

273
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
for your sense of taste.

274
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,080
Don’t take in salt or wine

275
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,860
after ten at night.

276
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,170
Take a photo of yourself

277
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,880
and the food before you have dinner.

278
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,440
Mr. Lu, don’t worry.

279
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,600
Mr. Lu, see you around.

280
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
Mr. Lu, take care.

281
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,290
Kiku-Masamune sake

282
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,400
is made by putting brewed sake into barrels again

283
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,170
and taking it out when its texture is the best.

284
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,300
Therefore,

285
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,280
it combines the intrinsic flavor of Japanese sake

286
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,080
and the light scent peculiar to Yoshino firs.

287
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Mr. Lu.

288
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,460
How careless I was.

289
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,660
I didn’t expect her to drink here.

290
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,010
I mustn’t let her detect anything.

291
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,480
It’s good.

292
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,200
Your comments

293
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,170
are especially concise this time.

294
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
Its taste is strong.

295
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,740
It deserves to be called Men’s booze.

296
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,720
Let me be straight with you.

297
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
I didn’t just come to give you booze.

298
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,680
Mu Chunfeng’s challenge...

299
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
If you came to persuade me

300
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,130
into accepting the challenge,

301
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,960
your treat will be in vain.

302
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,770
I’m not here to persuade you

303
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,780
but to tell you some information.

304
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,260
It’s up to you to decide whether you accept it or not.

305
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,040
I didn’t know except working,

306
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
my editor is also keen on gossiping.

307
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,920
Mr. Lu,

308
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,500
I don’t wish to be your friend.

309
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
But after so many years of cooperation,

310
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,930
I can’t show no emotion at this matter.

311
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,240
I hope you can patiently hear me out.

312
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,020
I won’t accept this challenge

313
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
whether you say it or not.

314
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,200
You must accept it.

315
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,170
These two

316
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,360
and a sashimi.

317
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,400
Okay.

318
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,490
-Thanks. -Wait a few minutes, please.

319
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,960
Thanks.

320
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
How are you doing?

321
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,640
Fairly well.

322
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,480
How about you, senior ?

323
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,440
Quite badly.

324
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,490
You’re still keeping that bottle?

325
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,600
Yes,

326
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
I’ve been keeping it.

327
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,720
I cherish

328
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
old times.

329
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,810
It’s been so many years.

330
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,960
Actually over the years,

331
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,680
I’ve always wanted to ask you a question.

332
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,600
Why didn’t you show up that day?

333
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You disappeared

334
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,080
from then on.

335
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,440
Where have you been

336
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,770
in the past seven years?

337
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,640
On your birthday,

338
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,210
I had a car accident.

339
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
How about now?

340
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,770
Have you recovered?

341
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
I’m all right now.

342
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
I stayed at the hospital too long

343
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
and my mom fell ill when I left it.

344
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,180
In order to look after her,

345
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,210
I had no choice but drop out.

346
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
You should have at least told me.

347
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,400
I may be of help.

348
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,280
I've been looking for you.

349
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,360
I thought that...

350
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,780
You thought I was dead?

351
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,070
Afterwards,

352
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,520
I couldn’t tell you.

353
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,840
Why?

354
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,620
After I left the hospital,

355
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,680
I found that everything

356
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,280
had changed around me.

357
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,200
I was too young

358
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,160
to cope with those changes.

359
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,820
Instead, I was exhausted by them.

360
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,240
You must have had a hard time.

361
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,180
Yes, very hard.

362
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,600
Alright,

363
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,140
it’s all over now, anyway.

364
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,480
I’m back again.

365
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,560
I’m really glad to

366
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
see you again.

367
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,480
First,

368
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,560
from where the magazine stands,

369
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,240
I prefer that you accept the challenge.

370
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,120
If you don’t,

371
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
it’ll be a disadvantage to our work.

372
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,000
Second,

373
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
public opinion is turning against you.

374
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,890
Someone saw the odd thing about you in the magic show.

375
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,640
Plus lately you’ve been rarely on the screen.

376
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,840
Suspicion is spreading among the public.

377
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,000
If you don’t accept the challenge,

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
I’m afraid it’ll go rampant.

379
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,800
Third,

380
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,520
Mu Chunfeng is a newcomer

381
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,250
and his career is in ascent.

382
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,680
You’ve dominated the profession for years.

383
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,280
The others have wanted to replace you for long.

384
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,520
What do you think, Mr. Lu?

385
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,570
You said someone looked like me. Who’s he?

386
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,600
He?

387
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,280
He’s my boss.

388
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,000
Your boss.

389
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
When you’re complaining about him,

390
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,160
I feel like

391
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,920
you’re complaining about your boyfriend.

392
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,360
Who?

393
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,840
Lu Weixun?

394
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
How’s that possible?

395
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,010
You misunderstood.

396
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,200
Lu Weixun

397
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,680
is just a jinx.

398
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,680
Since I met him,

399
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,840
my life has become hard.

400
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,280
You simply can’t imagine it.

401
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,000
Although his IQ is like those of ordinary people,

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,200
his EQ is so low that it’ll make you furious.

403
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,680
He has eccentricities all over him

404
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,890
and he’s extremely irascible.

405
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,980
I bet his hairline will recede sooner or later.

406
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,260
Why are you here?

407
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,160
I’m wondering about that, too.

408
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,560
He Buzui.

409
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Lamb Kidney.

410
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,840
What a coincidence.

411
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,370
They’re both your friends?

412
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,280
Who’s he?

413
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
What’s your relationship with him?

414
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,720
He’s my senior.

415
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,400
Please, don’t embarrass me.

416
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,000
He’s my boss,

417
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,960
Lu Weixun.

418
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,210
I don’t think anyone as my enemy

419
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,480
and I don’t wanna accept the challenge.

420
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,340
I hope you can reconsider it.

421
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,240
He Buzui.

422
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
This is my senior,

423
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,920
Yi Beidao.

424
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
This is my boss,

425
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Lu Weixun.

426
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,680
Hello.

427
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,440
You look nothing like me.

428
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,160
What?

429
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,920
senior,

430
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,040
I’ll treat you again another day.

431
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,800
Let’s go back quickly.

432
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,560
I need to study.

433
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,120
What’s the rush?

434
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
We’ll sign a supplementary agreement at home.

435
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,120
What is it now?

436
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,560
Don’t date anyone before the contract expires.

437
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,120
I don’t allow you to

438
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,640
kiss.

439
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,920
Why?

440
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,760
We’re just working together.

441
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,360
I didn’t sell myself to you.

442
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,960
You don’t let me date anyone.

443
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,800
What if I’m left on the shelf?

444
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,530
I’ll take the responsibility.

445
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,080
Don’t think too much.

446
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,040
I’m not gonna marry you

447
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
but I can compensate you with money.

448
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,560
All you can see is money, isn’t it?

449
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,040
Can you buy love and youth with money?

450
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,140
There are so many things I want to do.

451
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,640
Why should I date someone?

452
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,680
You’ve never fallen for a girl, have you?

453
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,160
I’ll only fall for a bottle of nice wine.

454
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,840
Sure.

455
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,780
People like you

456
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,080
don’t deserve love at all.

457
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,920
Only blind and crazy girls

458
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,500
will be attracted by you.

459
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,840
Excuse me,

460
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,240
there are too many people who like me.

461
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
It’s easy for me

462
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,880
to be in a relationship

463
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,020
and it just depends on my wish.

464
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,400
Unlike you

465
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
you’re always thinking about

466
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,240
but you’re neither gentle nor caring.

467
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,120
Considering you face

468
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,600
and figure,

469
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,210
not a man will marry you.

470
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,680
You...

471
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,520
Excuse me,

472
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,000
you are harassing me

473
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,520
by following me.

474
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,800
Miss,

475
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,100
aren’t you flattering yourself?

476
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,740
This is the way to my home, too.

477
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,080
Okay,

478
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,530
go in front of me.

479
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,320
So now are you harassing me?

480
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,480
Taxi.

481
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,960
I’ll add another one.

482
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,300
Don’t walk alone without waiting for your boss.

483
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,040
You ought to work out.

484
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,800
You’re too weak.

485
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,160
The wind will blow you over.

486
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,840
I can beat ten people like you.

487
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,100
Does it work to run so fast?

488
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,040
Do you know the password?

489
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,760
Paper tiger.

490
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,800
Your sound control lamp is broken.

491
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,720
Fix it quickly

492
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,560
or your villa will lose face.

493
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,400
How come nothing has gone wrong

494
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,040
before you live here?

495
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,940
[Zhuzhu]

496
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Hello, Zhuzhu.

497
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,800
Mi Ya,

498
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
let me tell you some gossip.

499
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,260
What time is it now?

500
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,640
You’re still in the mood for that?

501
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,600
Hear me out.

502
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,600
Today

503
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,560
I met a female fan

504
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
of Mu Chunfeng on Weibo.

505
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
She told me

506
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,840
actually Mu Chunfeng...

507
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,400
Really?

508
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,240
Okay, I’ve got it.

509
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,860
Thank you, Zhuzhu.

510
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,560
Sorry that I kept you waiting.

511
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,280
That’s alright.

512
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,940
Have a seat.

513
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,560
I just arrived here, too.

514
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,200
This place is close to my work.

515
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,400
But I asked to meet you

516
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,440
and gentlemen shouldn’t keep ladies waiting.

517
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,360
Have a try.

518
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,680
Thank you.

519
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,630
Verbena,

520
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,800
rosemary,

521
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,800
and chamomile.

522
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,159
They all have a sedative effect.

523
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,280
Miss Mi Ya,

524
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,000
have you suffered from stress recently?

525
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes.

526
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,630
Facing a capable player

527
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,280
who told almost all of the ingredients

528
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,150
of a tea before he drank it,

529
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,080
I feel stressed.

530
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,600
You flatter me, Miss Mi Ya.

531
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,190
Unlike some people,

532
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,600
stumping others is not my style.

533
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,159
Is the tea not to your taste, Mr. Mu?

534
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,760
I hear you once studied in France

535
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,699
so I specially ordered its herb tea.

536
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,810
That’s kind of you, Miss Mi Ya.

537
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,920
Actually,

538
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,280
the quality of herb tea is much the same.

539
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,840
But if people

540
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,920
make it in different ways,

541
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,880
its texture will vary slightly.

542
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,960
I don’t get it.

543
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,560
What’s wrong with the tea I made?

544
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,600
It’s too rush.

545
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,720
Why?

546
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,800
High temperature

547
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,580
will destroy tannin and caffeine in tea leaves.

548
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,530
The texture will be much worse.

549
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,840
A box of fine tea leaves

550
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
and a pot of boiling water are there.

551
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,000
Could you really hang on, Mr. Mu?

552
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Sure.

553
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,920
I don’t think so.

554
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,000
Last night...

555
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,940
You don’t need to thank me.

556
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,720
The pimple on your forehead is gonna burst.

557
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,680
I had experiences with pimples.

558
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,000
If you don’t deal with it,

559
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,680
there will be more soon.

560
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,850
There’s a convenient store there. Pull over.

561
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,160
I’m in a hurry.

562
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,840
I didn’t expect the perfectionist, Lu Weixun,

563
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,080
would allow pimples on his face.

564
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,480
Anyway, it’s not on my face.

565
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,280
Never mind.

566
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,360
Alright,

567
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,380
let’s change the subject for an easy one.

568
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,760
I hear you studied in France for a long time.

569
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,280
It provided you with

570
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,410
the first taste of red wine, didn’t it?

571
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,440
When I was a student,

572
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,370
I wanted to study to make wine, too.

573
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,600
According to your tone,

574
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,520
you didn’t realize your dream, did you?

575
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,280
That’s why

576
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,040
I particularly wanted to see you, Mr. Mu.

577
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
Why did you

578
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,300
give up studying in France, Miss Mi Ya?

579
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,090
You’re so outstanding.

580
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,000
No school would reject you.

581
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,860
It’s because of my family.

582
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,680
What a pity.

583
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,160
So I envy you

584
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,750
having that kind of chance.

585
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,560
Your family must have been very supportive.

586
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,960
Not really.

587
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,760
Then you must have

588
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,000
seized a special opportunity.

589
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Your tea is cool.

590
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,920
Let me change it for another one.

591
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,180
Here you go.

592
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,720
Take it.

593
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,060
How should I use it?

594
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,930
Stick it on your pimple.

595
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,400
Left.

596
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,960
Right.

597
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,120
Higher.

598
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,240
Right.

599
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,560
Squat down.

600
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,960
Squat down.

601
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
That’s too low.

602
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,660
You asked me to squat down.

603
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,600
Okay.

604
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,040
Why are you laughing?

605
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,320
I still can’t believe that you got a pimple.

606
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,260
Did you secretly eat pig’s feet at night?

607
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,600
He Buzui,

608
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,800
you are courting death.

609
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,440
Hello, Mr. Lu.

610
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,160
What do you

611
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,760
think of Lu Weixun’s refusal to accept

612
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Mu Chunfeng’s challenge?

613
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
To be honest,

614
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,040
Mu Chunfeng is a good lad.

615
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,560
If he wins this game,

616
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,120
I’ll consider letting him

617
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,480
manage Rose Winery.

618
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,900
I have faith in him.

619
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,400
-What’s your relation... -I don’t know him.

620
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,280
Are there holes in

621
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,920
the heads of those rich men?

622
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,080
Otherwise, why do they always

623
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,920
have those dumb ideas?

624
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,000
What holes?

625
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,320
It may be a pimple.

626
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,320
Let’s go.

627
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,520
That’s it for today.

628
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,060
The interview is over now.

629
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,680
-Go.  -We’ll talk again in the future,

630
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,080
okay?

631
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,800
Thank you.

632
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,080
Hello, Mr. Lu.

633
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,160
Hello.

634
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,670
What can I do for you?

635
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,200
Do you know the dope on Mu Chunfeng?

636
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,000
With my strength,

637
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,960
I don’t need to know that.

638
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,680
Take care of everything here.

639
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,400
The president wants to talk about the competition with me.

640
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,530
Okay, Chief Editor.

641
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,050
The actor hasn’t agreed to perform yet

642
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,840
but you’re putting up the stage already, aren’t you?

643
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,480
Do you know Mu Chunfeng’s

644
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,400
relationship with your father?

645
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Their relationship is just about a winery.

646
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,040
Do you know

647
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,400
who’s the investor behind Mu Chunfeng?

648
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,520
There’s someone behind Mu Chunfeng?

649
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,560
Of course.

650
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,720
I just learned that today.

651
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,760
Tell us.

652
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,840
Don’t keep us in confuse.

653
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,880
Yes, tell us now.

654
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,160
The president of the Lu Group,

655
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,360
the boss of Rose Winery

656
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,200
and the dad of the wine expert, Lu Weixun.

657
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,120
You mean Lu Linong?

658
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,680
He’s challenging his own son.

659
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,760
Tell me about it.

660
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,320
Isn’t that exciting?

661
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,680
Lu Weixun is doomed to failure.

662
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,040
Mu Chunfeng and your dad...
