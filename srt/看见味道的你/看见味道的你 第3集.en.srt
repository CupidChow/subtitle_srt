1
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,200
What?

2
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
The wine in Muunas Winery is spoiled?

3
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,200
Yes.

4
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,600
I’ve talked to the winery owner.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,440
The wine will be destroyed

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,000
instead of selling on the market.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,680
Mr. Lu,

8
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
I admire your decision,

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,080
but in that case we’ll recommend

10
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,800
a type of wine

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,920
that’ll never appear on the market!

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,700
Mr. Lu, it’ll put us in a difficult position.

13
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,820
The one who brought you this trouble is not me

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,440
but the winery.

15
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,440
I’ve examined the new wine of the winery

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
according to the requirements of the selected topic.

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,330
I have to write about the truth.

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,030
Sorry.

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,680
Mr. Lu, I…

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,960
Mi Ya,

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,200
has Lu Weixun delivered the article yet?

22
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,260
If not, you’ve got to carry out plan B.

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,040
He has.

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,770
How come I didn’t see it?

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,440
I’m still editing it.

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,600
That’s not necessary!

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,660
We don’t have time.

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,240
Plus, Lu Weixun never allows us

29
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,520
to edit his articles.

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,720
It’s an exception this time.

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Let me see.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
I can’t use this article!

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
I asked him to write about red wine tasting.

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,480
But now he sent me an article about some wine

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,360
that won’t even be sold on the market!

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,620
Then what’s the point?

37
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,920
It’s a useless article to us!

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,120
Mi Ya.

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,210
How did you communicated with him?

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,000
If you can’t deal with Lu Weixun,

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,620
Then

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
you can forget about your special column

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
of Chief sommelier.

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,210
Alright,

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,220
let’s use the backup plan.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,530
This is not the best option.

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
I’ve thought about

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,620
a solution which allows us

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,820
to use his article as the way it is.

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,040
I’m listening.

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,000
Although this article is about

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,860
Lu Weixun’s opinion on a new wine,

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,120
I can put an editor’s note

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
after the article,

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
making it an interview about Lu Weixun.

56
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Interview?

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
He persuaded the winery owner

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
to destroy the wine,

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,320
even if it means the owner

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,320
will have to bear huge loss.

61
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,320
This will become shocking news in the industry.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,320
We can take this opportunity

63
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,580
to publicize Lu Weixun in a positive way.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,640
Everybody knows

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,760
that Lu Weixun writes article exclusively for Dr'Wine.

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,070
A positive publicity about Lu Weixun

67
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,880
will also benefit our magazine.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Mi Ya had a nice talk with Chief Editor.

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
Really?

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,400
I heard that Lu Weixun didn’t deliver his article on time.

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,000
The column will go blank this time!

72
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,960
You didn’t see

73
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,320
how angry Chief Editor was

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,280
when he went into Mi Ya’s office.

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,159
Mr. Lu is arrogant and unyielding.

76
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,960
Mi Ya will have a hard time again.

77
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
Let’s pray for her.

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,740
That’s a good idea!

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Then draft an article now.

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,659
- Hurry!  - Okay!

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,560
Mi Ya.

82
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,560
Good job!

83
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
What’s going on?

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,640
That’s right.

85
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,920
I think the column can’t continue anymore.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,160
- It’s never happened before.  - Never.

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,690
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,130
Have you done your work?

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,480
That was easy!

90
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,520
Mi Ya is amazing!

91
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,080
I have good news for you!

92
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,600
What good news?

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
We’ll be able to

94
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,760
pay our debt off soon!

95
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,680
I thought we’ve already paid him off.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,640
You must be confused.

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,159
That’s right!

98
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,159
Dad.

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,840
You are right!

100
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,200
I’m confused!

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,450
What do you want?

102
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,480
Where are you?

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,480
At home.

104
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,320
I’ll be there soon.

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,480
This is the first time Dr'Wine introduced a type of wine

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
that’ll never be sold on the market.

107
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,920
Although the wine has been destroyed

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,640
following Mr. Lu Weixun’s request,

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,440
it shows the winemakers’

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,720
perfect pursuit of the quality of wine,

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,200
and the absolute trust

112
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,159
between winemakers and sommeliers.

113
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,159
This time, instead of recommending a new type of wine,

114
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
we’d love to focus on the winemakers

115
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,200
and sommeliers’ belief in wine.

116
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,600
Lu Weixun,

117
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
I can only help you this much.

118
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,800
How a man behaves in front of wine is how he behaves in life.

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,280
The article had a problem.

120
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,280
The sommelier doesn’t live up to his reputation.

121
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,400
You can’t taste the flavor anyway.

122
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
So water will be fine for you.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,400
I’ve been thinking about

124
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,800
the pattern of our sense of taste exchange

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,159
these days.

126
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,200
The first time it happened at the hospital.

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,440
We exchanged our sense of taste

128
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,440
at about 12 p.m.

129
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,000
But I lost it again

130
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
in about one hour.

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,440
The second time it happened in Muunas Winery.

132
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,400
I noticed

133
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,120
that it was

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,000
at about 5:17 p.m.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
After I tasted the wine,

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,210
I kept drinking the bitter gourd soda.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,820
Then I lost my sense of taste again

138
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,160
at about 6:07 p.m.

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
It was 50 minutes,

140
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,400
almost an hour.

141
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,880
So?

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,960
Are you stupid?

143
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,850
Don’t you understand what I’m saying?

144
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,240
I do.

145
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,789
So what?

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,840
Aren’t you curious about

147
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,640
what exactly happened in there?

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,120
I’ve been thinking about

149
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,960
why you are so rich?

150
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
You have so much money

151
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,280
that you don’t even think about how much you spend.

152
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,200
Being a sommelier is really that lucrative?

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,400
That’s why you can’t wait

154
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,670
to get your sense of taste back, right?

155
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,400
How much is your sense of taste worth exactly?

156
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,040
Greedy!

157
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,960
Anyway.

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,680
The lips contact

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,960
is only part of the reason.

160
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
We need to find out the rest.

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,160
How?

162
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,620
Let’s replay every detail when we first met.

163
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,960
Why do we have to replay this part?

164
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,930
The sense of taste exchange

165
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,960
was triggered by multiple factors.

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,920
Time, location, people and event

167
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,240
are all possible factors

168
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
that may cause the exchange.

169
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
The error can be minimized

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,650
by controlling variables.

171
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,740
But, I…

172
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,920
I smashed your side-view mirror

173
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,960
right at here.

174
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,120
So you mean you want to do it again?

175
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,000
It’s up to you.

176
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,480
Then I wanted to get my plum bottle back.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,800
And I refused to give that to you.

178
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,280
So I tried to reach it.

179
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Then you asked for my ID card.

180
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
You didn’t give me

181
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,800
but stamped on my foot instead.

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I’m sorry!

183
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,640
Then I stepped back, further and further.

184
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,100
And there was a car coming.

185
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,120
Then,

186
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I saved your life.

187
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
And we…

188
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,960
No,

189
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,080
at that time, you lied on the ground.

190
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,360
Lie down.

191
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,320
Come on.

192
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,480
Hurry.

193
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,450
Don’t just stand there.

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,460
Come on.

195
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,200
Forget it.

196
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
It’s too dirty on the ground.

197
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,640
We’d better stand up…

198
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,080
I’m the boss!

199
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,380
It’s back!

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,320
Lu Weixun.

201
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,850
I can’t stand this job anymore.

202
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,240
I want a raise!

203
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,240
Mine is back!

204
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,320
40 minutes.

205
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,520
The first time it was from

206
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,480
12:05 p.m. to 1:05 p.m.,

207
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,260
60 minutes altogether.

208
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,960
The second time it was from 5:17 p.m. to 6:07 p.m.,

209
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,540
50 minutes.

210
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,640
And this time

211
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,280
it was only 40 minutes.

212
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,840
Every time we kissed,

213
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,920
the overall time will

214
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
reduce by 10 minutes.

215
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,960
So before we can find out the way

216
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,960
that’ll allow us exchange the sense of taste for good,

217
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,720
we only have

218
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,480
three chances left.

219
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,000
Three more?

220
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,200
She stays by your side,

221
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,320
but you appear in front of me again.

222
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
We pass by each other,

223
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,240
our thoughts start spreading along the coast.

224
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,840
We are struggling in between the hardship.

225
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,920
I’m surprised that we are not innocent anymore.

226
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,480
Love is dangerous,

227
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,840
miracle really exists in this world.

228
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,300
10 minutes shorter each time.

229
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,520
The God must suffer from OCD.

230
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,320
Dear audience!

231
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,320
Welcome to the second episode of

232
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Gourmet is Yummy!

233
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Could you taste the dish and tell me

234
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,000
what’s the dish is made of?

235
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,040
Whoever wins will be rewarded with

236
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,120
a big prize.

237
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,320
That much money?

238
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,080
If you are confident

239
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,040
about your sense of taste,

240
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,800
come join us now!

241
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,760
That’s right.

242
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,090
Since I’ve got the absolute taste,

243
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,800
I can’t waste it.

244
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,480
Hello, Mr. Lu.

245
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,920
Next month will be the founding anniversary of our magazine.

246
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,280
We want to focus the topic on

247
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,210
the history and future of red wine.

248
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,980
Cliché.

249
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,100
Right.

250
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
I know the topic is not creative.

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,520
So,

252
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,360
the Chief Editor picked two bottles of vintage wine.

253
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,000
They respectively

254
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,840
represent the past and present of red wine.

255
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,370
Those are actually what we want to introduce.

256
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,680
Terra Andina Suyai wine

257
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Grand Cru Classe wine of Chateau Haut-Brion.

258
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,440
Edward truly went all out this time.

259
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,050
Hope we’ll have the honor to work with you.

260
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
Can’t believe you delivered

261
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,520
such premium wine via express!

262
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,680
What a joke!

263
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,600
Alright

264
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,520
I’ll deliver in person next time.

265
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,800
If there’s nothing else,

266
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,130
I’ll hang up now, Mr. Lu.

267
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Mr. Lu, I’ve heard that you are gifted in wine tasting.

268
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,480
Even though owning such a talent,

269
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,200
you are still modest,

270
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,349
hardworking and proactive,

271
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,960
receiving great attention.

272
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,280
You are not conceited,

273
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,720
on the contrary, you are very down-to-earth.

274
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,880
I admire your spirit

275
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,880
and I sincerely hope

276
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,069
that I’ll be allowed a chance to meet you in person.

277
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,880
I happened to

278
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,240
obtain a bottle of fine wine.

279
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,109
I’d love to

280
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,640
share it

281
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,400
while enjoying a nice chat with you.

282
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,560
I hope you can accept my invitation.

283
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,520
Look forward to hearing from you.

284
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,680
Mu Chunfeng.

285
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,800
Boring!

286
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,400
Sorry.

287
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,400
I need to take this.

288
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,960
Okay.

289
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,000
Hello?

290
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,240
Gourmet is Yummy!

291
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,100
Taste the surprise with your tongue!

292
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,960
Welcome to…

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,800
Where are you?

294
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Why is it so noisy?

295
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,560
I…I’m outside.

296
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,220
Come back now!

297
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
We have work to do.

298
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
Is it urgent?

299
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,900
It’s not convenient for me right now.

300
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,680
Can I come back later?

301
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,680
When?

302
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,280
10 p.m.

303
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,880
Okay.

304
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,720
10 p.m.,

305
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
see you at Mbook Café.

306
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,360
Don’t be late!

307
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,440
- Don’t be late.  - Was it Lu Weixun?

308
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,360
I just work for him.

309
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,240
It’s not like he owns me!

310
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,600
You’ll be on soon.

311
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,000
Don’t be affected by him.

312
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
After several rounds,

313
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,440
the last two contestants

314
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,240
definitely possess

315
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,880
keen sense of taste!

316
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,240
Okay,

317
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,080
next,

318
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,640
we’ll present the last dish.

319
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,040
The dish includes

320
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,880
quite a few seasonings,

321
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,800
which are all blended in together.

322
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Which one of them can list all the seasonings

323
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,080
and get all the questions right?

324
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,000
Alright!

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
The dish has been

326
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
brought on the table.

327
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,810
Let’s see what’s going to happen next!

328
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,080
The dish looks very enticing!

329
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay!

330
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
Are you two ready?

331
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,490
Alright!

332
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,840
Ready? Go!

333
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,720
Contestant No. 2 smelled it first.

334
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,340
Then she took a bite.

335
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,040
They are both savoring carefully right now.

336
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,840
Judging from their expression,

337
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,520
I think

338
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,000
they’ve got their answers.

339
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,080
Okay,

340
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,080
then next,

341
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,780
please hear the

342
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
first question.

343
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,200
What’s the “meat” in this dish made of?

344
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,480
Tofu.

345
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,120
Bingo!

346
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,100
Congratulations,

347
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,960
your answer is correct!

348
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,040
Okay,

349
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,300
now it’s the

350
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
last question for today.

351
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,000
Let’s see if contestant No. 1

352
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,880
can come back!

353
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,560
Please bring us the question board.

354
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,760
Good.

355
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
Now, please get ready.

356
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,600
Our last question is,

357
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,760
what are the 14 seasonings included

358
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,840
in the dish? Please list them all.

359
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,280
One point for each seasoning.

360
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,840
Ready?

361
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,480
Go!

362
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,800
The two contestants are both quite good!

363
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,440
They are in the same pace.

364
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
Nice! Go on!

365
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,720
Contestant No. 2

366
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
seems to encounter some problem.

367
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,920
She stopped.

368
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,440
But contestant No. 1

369
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,480
keeps going.

370
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,920
He has listed 7 seasonings,

371
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,080
leaving contestant No. 2 behind.

372
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,880
Contestant No. 2 tastes the dish again,

373
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,600
hoping to find that missing flavor.

374
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,720
Come on, contestant No. 2.

375
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,040
Our contestant No. 1 has only one more to go!

376
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,340
His victory is upon him!

377
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
Contestant No. 2!

378
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,880
Can you figure out that missing flavor?

379
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Congratulations! Contestant No. 1 won!

380
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,680
He’ll be awarded a big prize!

381
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,480
Congratulations again!

382
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
It was a very intense contest!

383
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,720
Cheer up! Contestant No. 2!

384
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,240
Your performance today was not bad at all!

385
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Although you didn’t win,

386
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,530
you should still be proud of yourself.

387
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,600
I…

388
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,960
The flavors I’ve tasted are too few.

389
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,800
It’s okay!

390
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,280
Try to taste more food.

391
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,280
Hope you can

392
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,240
enjoy the lovely world

393
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,640
of gourmet

394
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,080
in the future.

395
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,760
Because

396
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,480
food is the essence of life.

397
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,000
I believe that you’ll become

398
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,400
an excellent gourmet one day.

399
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Now, dear friends,

400
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,120
let’s please give her

401
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,480
a big round of applause again!

402
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,300
He Buzui, let me toast for your brave!

403
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,040
Cheers!

404
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,200
One cup will be enough to make you drunk.

405
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,640
Don’t drink that much.

406
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,480
I’m fine!

407
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,840
It’s nothing.

408
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,340
You know

409
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,840
that I’m good at discouraging people.

410
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,240
Don’t think today is bad,

411
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,760
because tomorrow will be worse.

412
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,960
It’s not too bad.

413
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,370
You have temporary sense of taste now.

414
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,600
Don’t mention that to me.

415
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,920
The trouble I have right now

416
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,280
is all because of that temporary sense of taste.

417
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,800
I don’t even know

418
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,520
whether I’m cured or not.

419
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,920
The God must have a reason

420
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,200
to make it this way.

421
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,960
Only lamb kidney

422
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
can make me happy now.

423
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,970
If Lu Weixun knew that you are eating lamb kidney,

424
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,960
he’d be furious.

425
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,760
Boss!

426
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,720
She has such a strong presence!

427
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:53,960
Hi!

428
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,240
Any table available?

429
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,340
Let me ask.

430
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,700
Excuse me.

431
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,250
Is it ok if this lady shares the table with you?

432
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,760
Sure!

433
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,400
Here, take my seat.

434
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,340
Please.

435
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,480
Bring a set of cutlery.

436
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,160
Okay!

437
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Chicken heart, pork aorta, gristle, duck intestine,

438
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,960
beef kebab and mutton shashlik, 10 for each.

439
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,200
A can of beer and a lamb kidney kebab.

440
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,740
Thanks.

441
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,080
Okay, they’ll be ready soon.

442
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,210
You ordered so much!

443
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,100
We ordered pretty much the same.

444
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,500
Great minds think alike.

445
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,490
Tell me about it.

446
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,410
Two girls who both like lamb kidney sit together!

447
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,880
It takes a hundred years to stay in a boat together,

448
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
and it takes a thousand years to sleep on the same bed.

449
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,320
Since we sit together today eating kebabs together,

450
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,040
I’ll see you as my friend from now on.

451
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,600
My name is

452
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,770
He Buzui!

453
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,690
Hao Yong.

454
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,940
Mi Ya.

455
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,560
Why are you sighing?

456
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,520
I’ve gained a superpower recently.

457
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,100
But I don’t know how to use it.

458
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
It feels like I missed

459
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,440
100 million.

460
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,200
What about you?

461
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,480
Our partner is too difficult to work with.

462
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,210
He’s arrogant, aggressive and a perfectionist.

463
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,080
So hard to please him.

464
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
Same as my boss!

465
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,480
He thinks he’s the center of the universe.

466
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,760
And everybody should revolve around him!

467
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,080
So tell me,

468
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,840
how did you lose your 100 million deal?

469
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,440
I found that making money through eating

470
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,880
is not as easy

471
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,400
as I thought.

472
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,530
Tasting the flavor alone won’t be enough.

473
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,720
It’s 10:10 already!

474
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,000
I’ve reminded you earlier.

475
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,980
I have to go now!

476
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
You guys continue.

477
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Hao Yong, please pay the bill for me!

478
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,530
I’ll go pay the bill now.

479
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,160
boss

480
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,680
Go straight, then…

481
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,000
Turn left.

482
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,360
Excuse me,

483
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,480
did you see a man sitting here earlier?

484
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,800
He’s tall and handsome,

485
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,040
but with a deadpan face!

486
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,500
Are you looking for Mr. Lu?

487
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,080
He left at 10.

488
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,280
10?

489
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,320
Oh no, I’m dead!

490
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
My boss is mad at me.

491
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,920
How can I make it up to him?

492
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
Boss,

493
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,400
sorry,

494
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,760
it was my fault.

495
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,720
It won’t happen again.

496
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
The youngest master.

497
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
A talented boy with absolute sense of taste.

498
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,680
Young master ran away from home.

499
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,840
Disqualified successor of a wealthy family.

500
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,440
Mr. Wine,

501
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,600
Prince charming of young girls.

502
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,680
Young girls,

503
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,920
wake up.

504
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Lu Weixun,

505
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,200
why didn’t you reply my message?

506
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,520
There’s no point to apologize.

507
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,120
The result is irreversible.

508
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Then you should at least talk to me.

509
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,880
Do you know

510
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,000
an arrogant boss like you

511
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,440
is really annoying?

512
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,040
I don’t care if you like me.

513
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,640
You just work for me.

514
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,480
That’s right.

515
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,760
You are just my boss.

516
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,580
Then what are you going to do next?

517
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,280
As a sommelier with contract spirit,

518
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,330
I’ll add supplementary terms.

519
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,880
Can I say no?

520
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,360
You don’t have to accept.

521
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,420
And I don’t have to pay you.

522
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,760
Don’t always threaten me of not paying!

523
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,890
You really think money is that useful?

524
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
What do you think?

525
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Sometimes it really is.

526
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,440
But I have right to know

527
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,800
the contents of the terms.

528
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,260
I’ll talk to you tomorrow.

529
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,320
Contestant No. 2! Come on!

530
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,440
Come on!

531
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,320
Our contestant No. 1

532
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,280
keeps going.

533
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,400
Congratulations!

534
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,140
That’s my daughter, He Buzui!

535
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,360
He will be awarded a big prize!

536
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,120
You got up!

537
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,360
Congratulations!

538
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:48,880
Buzui.

539
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,120
See, how nice your boss is!

540
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,960
He has something to talk to you

541
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,220
and he came very early.

542
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,160
Mr. Lu.

543
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,370
You are here to have breakfast?

544
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Watch your mouth!

545
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,840
He is your boss!

546
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,600
If he wants, you even need to cook him

547
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,120
Manchu-Han Imperial Banquet,

548
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,800
let alone breakfast.

549
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,630
Dad,

550
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,120
have you been brainwashed by him?

551
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,050
What brainwash?

552
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,120
I’m just educated!

553
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,840
Have some water, please!

554
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,960
Come out with me.

555
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Please forgive her.

556
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,409
Mr. He, I’m leaving.

557
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,150
Okay.

558
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,810
Take a seat.

559
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,050
You tried to make money with my sense of taste.

560
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
Seems like you are not satisfied

561
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,280
with the salary I pay you.

562
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,820
If you don’t like this job,

563
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,960
I can ask De to talk to you.

564
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,330
I just wanted to pay you back

565
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,530
the money I owe you as soon as possible!

566
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,800
Lu Weixun,

567
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,680
you should know that

568
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,530
not everybody is as lucky as you

569
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,440
having a wealthy family

570
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
and no life pressure.

571
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,800
Lucky?

572
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,920
Sure,

573
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,520
meeting you is actually a real bad luck in my life!

574
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,840
Since you were absent form work yesterday,

575
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,570
I need you to sign two supplementary agreements.

576
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,320
First,

577
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,560
I need to clarify the ownership.

578
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,840
What ownership?

579
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,010
The ownership of my sense of taste,

580
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,600
and the right of final interpretation.

581
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,080
You will only exercise those rights on behalf of me for now.

582
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,880
In the future,

583
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,560
you need to get my permission

584
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
every time you use my sense of taste.

585
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,120
And you can only use it after I approved.

586
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,280
So you mean I have to report you whatever I eat and drink?

587
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,520
Yes, all of it!

588
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,760
This is the due responsibility

589
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,440
of a beneficiary like you who gains my sense of taste

590
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,160
to shoulder

591
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,410
for a victim like me.

592
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,280
Okay.

593
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,480
I guess it makes sense.

594
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,250
I’ll do that.

595
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,490
In addition,

596
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,160
I heard that you once worked a bodyguard?

597
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,960
So what?

598
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,760
That’ll affect your sense of taste too?

599
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,890
The second agreement I want you to sign

600
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,850
is security agreement.

601
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,800
Finally you realized that your way of act

602
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,220
will put you in danger!

603
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,950
The thing you need to protect is my sense of taste.

604
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,680
From now on,

605
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,640
you’ll need to work eight hours longer.

606
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,200
From 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. of next day.

607
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,090
You need to be wherever I am.

608
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,360
Your salary will be raised to 10,000 Yuan per month.

609
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,320
But there’s no compensation for working overtime.

610
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,160
There are 24 hours a day.

611
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,200
You ask me to work 16 hours?

612
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,080
You think I’m your pet?

613
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,680
Yes, you are!

614
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,080
And not as obedient as pet!

615
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,530
You violated labor law.

616
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,580
Then I’ll ask De to talk to you?

617
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,880
Then what am I supposed to do when you go to bed?

618
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,760
There are enough rooms in my house for you to sleep.

619
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,740
I can take the night shift at home.

620
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,700
At home?

621
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,960
Miss He.

622
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,020
You’ve blown that chance!

623
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,220
I promise I won’t make the same mistake as yesterday.

624
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,440
as yesterday again.

625
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,560
Since you were absent from work yesterday,

626
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,680
I’ve lost my faith in you.

627
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,680
I think you also want to pay off your debt as soon as possible.

628
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,640
I’ve bought more hours from you.

629
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,410
And you can earn more money.

630
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,080
It’s a win-win,

631
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,880
and the best solution.

632
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,480
Moreover,

633
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,120
I can’t let you disturb my regular life,

634
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,880
so you can only bring a 24-inch suitcase.

635
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,200
Thank you!

636
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,760
Beidao.

637
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,000
Why do you name the bar “The Bar?”

638
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,080
Does it have any particular meaning?

639
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,880
Why didn’t you come to the amusement park that day?

640
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,240
I’d been waiting for you.

641
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,960
Where have you been?

642
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Where are you?

643
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,760
What do you do?

644
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,780
It’s been seven years.

645
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,600
I’ve never heard from you.

646
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
I’ve learned how to protect myself.

647
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,380
You’ve got to take good care of yourself.

648
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,360
I’ve had a bit issue with an annoying guy recently.

649
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,960
Like I’m not unlucky enough!

650
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,660
But he’s not that evil.

651
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
A little bit like you.

652
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,280
Lift it up.

653
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,360
As the owner of this house,

654
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,840
there are a few things I need to emphasize.

655
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,040
What things?

656
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,160
First,

657
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,520
no noise.

658
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,960
Second,

659
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,840
you can only eat

660
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,090
at the dining space.

661
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,120
Third,

662
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,170
water the orchid every day,

663
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,760
and avoid rotting the roots.

664
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,160
Last one,

665
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,480
also the most important one,

666
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,400
you must follow my order!

667
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,650
Come with me.

668
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,880
This is your room.

669
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,920
Be gentle!

670
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
You can go out now!
