1
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,100
WSA

2
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,110
is a short form for Wine & Spirit Association.

3
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,020
Whoever is acknowledged by WSA

4
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,800
will possess the power

5
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,820
of classifying and pricing wines.

6
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,900
Lu Weixun

7
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,140
is known as the youngest member of WSA ever.

8
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,380
That’s why

9
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,180
he is seen as a professional sommelier in China.

10
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,620
Lu Weixun is well known in the industry

11
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,979
for his accurate classification and strict pricing.

12
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,780
Unfortunately,

13
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,500
such a perfect and handsome man

14
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,030
is ruined by his bad temper!

15
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,460
This is a simple wine!

16
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,510
Perfectionism!

17
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,260
OCD!

18
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,540
Mysophobia!

19
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,060
The wholesale price of this wine

20
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,500
Unreasonably!

21
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,140
should be less than 100 Yuan.

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,320
And its retail price should be no more than 200 Yuan!

23
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,980
You are literally destroying my brand!

24
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,820
Your brand is destroyed by yourself

25
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,800
because you are unaware of your brand positioning.

26
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,560
Good! Awesome!

27
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,740
Good! Good!

28
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,980
Thank you, guys!

29
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,100
Amazing!

30
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,980
Brother

31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,740
You are here!

32
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,540
- Brother how are you doing?  -Stop!

33
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,100
Save it!

34
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,100
Be quick!

35
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,700
That’s it?

36
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,040
Only this much?

37
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
I’m telling you,

38
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,940
if you don’t pay me off

39
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,380
by the 10th of next month,

40
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,780
you and your father can say goodbye to your peaceful life!

41
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,510
Understand?

42
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,860
don’t you worry!

43
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,380
I will figure out a way to pay you back!

44
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,860
But my father

45
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,620
is old

46
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,920
and not in good health,

47
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,740
he can’t take any fright.

48
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,300
If he has any accident…

49
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,500
Stop! Stop it!

50
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,580
So what, if he has an accident?

51
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,860
You think I’ll be responsible for the rest of his life?

52
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,190
He’ll become my father after being yours?

53
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,060
I won’t use my life in exchange for money!

54
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,860
Please understand that it’s not easy for me

55
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,980
to come out at night and stop you on the way.

56
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,510
It’s very difficult for me!

57
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,420
De, take it easy!

58
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,940
Luckily, I outsmart him!

59
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,340
Otherwise this will be a hard month again!

60
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,180
Still can’t taste anything!

61
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,860
My senior,

62
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,500
where have you go ?

63
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,580
Dad!

64
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,240
It’s getting cold.

65
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,420
Don’t do the accounts outside anymore.

66
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,180
Buzui,

67
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,220
why father’s accounts don’t match again!

68
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,780
Let me see.

69
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,340
You put one more zero here.

70
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,659
One more zero?

71
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
Count again.

72
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,260
That’s right!

73
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,659
I’m getting more and more confused.

74
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,740
It’s okay!

75
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,860
Don’t worry.

76
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,580
You are

77
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,070
the so called “never-get-drunk” who defeated Black Whirlwind brothers?

78
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,580
That’s me!

79
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,940
My rule here is simple.

80
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,660
You win if you can

81
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,100
drink all the liquor on the table within one minute.

82
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,020
You win,

83
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,140
the money is yours.

84
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,460
You lose,

85
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,580
quit the drinking gambling forever!

86
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,140
That easy?

87
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,299
Easy?

88
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,740
I don’t think so!

89
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,940
The liquor on the table is

90
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
much stronger than the regular one.

91
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,260
It took me a long time to find it.

92
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,340
But,

93
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,900
it’s worth

94
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,640
to using it challenge you!

95
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,860
Okay!

96
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,060
Good!

97
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,380
Zui!

98
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,740
Had a nice drink tonight?

99
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,300
Not bad!

100
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,820
It’s the same every time.

101
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,900
But the liquor today was

102
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,020
a little bit different.

103
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,980
It gave me déjà vu.

104
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,740
As if I drank it before.

105
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,580
I thought you don’t have sense of taste.

106
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,510
How could you tell the difference?

107
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,180
It felt different.

108
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,780
What are you doing here?

109
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,870
I’m here to check on you.

110
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,340
I’m late!

111
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,060
I have another appointment to go! See you!

112
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,860
Careful!

113
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Be safe!

114
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,620
That crappy bottle of yours will break sooner or later.

115
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,460
Other girls

116
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
carry Doraemon or Baymax,

117
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,420
but you

118
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,300
carry a crappy bottle every day!

119
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,900
It’s not a crappy bottle!

120
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,420
It’s…

121
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,820
a secret!

122
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,980
Secret…

123
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,950
I know it was a gift from your prince charming!

124
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,020
Wait!

125
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,900
Stop!

126
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,740
8820!

127
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,310
Keep one meter away from me!

128
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,140
Why?

129
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,820
You think I’m going to eat you?

130
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,150
You smell like alcohol!

131
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,580
Why did you risk your life chasing my car in a hurry?

132
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,940
My stuff got stuck on your car.

133
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,500
Give me!

134
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,900
Give me!

135
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,320
Give me!

136
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
What…what do you mean?

137
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,670
Under such circumstances,

138
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,800
- I had no other choice!  -Your ID card.

139
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,900
I don’t have time.

140
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,940
Leave me your ID and phone number.

141
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,140
I’ll contact you later

142
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,940
to talk about the compensation.

143
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,020
Then give me the bottle first!

144
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,340
Your ID card!

145
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,820
Alright!

146
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,340
Watch out!

147
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,180
Have a cup of frothy coffee in the morning

148
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,020
when I’m thinking about you.

149
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,140
Close my eyes and enjoy the aftertaste.

150
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,740
Didn’t sleep at all last night,

151
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,780
worrying that you’d refuse me.

152
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,060
A glass of old wine would make my drunk,

153
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,940
I relive the past over and over,

154
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,060
and start missing you more and more.

155
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,820
Give me another chance

156
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,940
to be with you.

157
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,960
What are you doing?

158
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,230
That’s my water!

159
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,120
You are unreasonable!

160
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,380
Forget it!

161
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,220
Since you saved my life,

162
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,670
I won’t bug you anymore.

163
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,340
I have another drinking appointment to go.

164
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,540
I’m leaving, see you.

165
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,740
No longer see!

166
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,940
Right, no longer see!

167
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,750
It’s the money for repairing your car.

168
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,140
I’m at the

169
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,580
activity site right now!

170
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,900
Are you also looking forward to the activity

171
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,820
as much as I do?

172
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,900
Friend,

173
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,660
you don’t know Lu Weixun?

174
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,860
He’s a professional sommelier in China.

175
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,580
His sense of taste is beyond your imagination!

176
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,220
He’s an absolute talent!

177
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,100
“Thank you, love you so much!”

178
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,420
I love you too!

179
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,820
This netizen named “Cry in a BMW,”

180
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,420
don’t try to mislead people.

181
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,100
My idol depends on his own ability

182
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,780
to become famous in the field of wine commentary,

183
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,100
which is known by everybody.

184
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,660
Right?

185
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,860
That’s right!

186
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,780
Let me warn you again!

187
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,120
Don’t mislead people!

188
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,300
My idol left home when he was 20

189
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,500
and began to fight for a career on his own.

190
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,020
The rumor about him from a rich family

191
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,020
came out after he became famous!

192
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,660
He’s about to join this crossover cooperation

193
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,820
because he wants to prove to his father, who’s not supportive of his career,

194
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,960
that he can become a star in his own right

195
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,100
in a field he’s interested in!

196
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,140
He’s here!

197
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:54,100
Lu Weixun! Lu Weixun! Lu Weixun!

198
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,700
I love you! Lu Weixun!

199
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,660
Lu Weixun! I love you!

200
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,500
Calm down! Calm down!

201
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,780
So handsome!

202
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,260
Idol!

203
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,339
Sorry!

204
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,500
You win

205
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,220
if you can drink all of it within one minute!

206
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,540
One minute?

207
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,020
You sure?

208
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,740
What?

209
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,380
Too short?

210
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,900
More than…

211
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,110
Are you alright?

212
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,700
More than I need!

213
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,070
I might catch a cold.

214
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,060
Doesn’t matter.

215
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,990
Are you nervous?

216
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,700
To be honest,

217
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,220
a little.

218
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,220
This.

219
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,750
What’s that?

220
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,100
Plan B.

221
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,380
The right order of the wine tag.

222
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,420
Memorize it beforehand

223
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,750
in case of any accident.

224
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,140
I don’t need it.

225
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,780
Good!

226
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,940
I admire your confidence!

227
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,980
But remember,

228
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,260
you only have 60 seconds.

229
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,340
If any accident happens,

230
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,800
I’ll have to smash the water tank.

231
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,940
There won’t be any accident.

232
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,020
I promise!

233
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,380
Okay!

234
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,580
Good!

235
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,340
Ladies and Gentlemen!

236
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,060
I’m magician Alexander!

237
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,220
It’s a pleasure to be here in China, an ancient mysterious country!

238
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,500
Ladies and Gentlemen!

239
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,700
Good evening!

240
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,100
Evening!

241
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,820
Please allow me to introduce to you

242
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,420
the most beautiful lady tonight, Ms. Marilyn!

243
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,700
And the most special friend tonight,

244
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
talented sommelier,

245
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,820
Lu Weixun!

246
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:59,540
Lu Weixun! Lu Weixun! Lu Weixun!

247
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,740
Tonight,

248
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,340
keep your eyes open!

249
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,400
Don’t be deceived by what you see!

250
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,180
I’ll invite three people from the audience to join our dinner party!

251
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,900
Here!

252
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,500
Me! Pick me! Me!

253
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,060
Nice!

254
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,300
Our dear guests

255
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,100
have picked their favorite wine.

256
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,140
The three cards in my hand

257
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,700
will give the description of the wine picked by the three guests.

258
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,380
But,

259
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,500
Mr. Lu

260
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,380
is only allowed to find the three types of wine

261
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,820
with his super sense of taste,

262
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
and find the right position

263
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,060
from the coded lock that seals the magic sword

264
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,700
so as to release the sword

265
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,180
and save my beloved!

266
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
Mr. Lu,

267
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,180
I’ll describe the three types of wine now.

268
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
The first one

269
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,700
reminds you of a harvest orchard in fall.

270
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,620
The branches are covered with crimson berries.

271
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,700
Deep in the orchard,

272
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,240
you can see a young girl in a light pink dress.

273
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,180
The second one

274
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,380
is like a benevolent senor gentleman in grey hair.

275
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,660
With a mischievous child in his arms

276
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,380
on New Year’s Eve,

277
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,630
he is peeling the walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds

278
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,940
that spread out on the table,

279
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,100
one after another,

280
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,660
and feed the kid patiently

281
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,180
with pure love and care.

282
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,500
That’s the second one.

283
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,620
The last one

284
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,740
brings you

285
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,020
to a primary forest.

286
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,500
Along the fragrance of the wood, you can’t help but walk

287
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,520
on a path that leads you to a vapor-enshrouded lake.

288
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,420
You are surrounded by a bunch of dancing butterflies

289
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,540
in the shrubs that smell like aromatic red berries.

290
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,940
Mr. Lu has only 60 seconds

291
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,620
to give us his answers!

292
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,820
- One!  - One!

293
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
- Two!  - Two!

294
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,900
- Three!  - Three!

295
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,540
Nice!

296
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,900
Good! Very good!

297
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,580
Crimson berries.

298
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,260
A girl in pick dress in the strawberry field.

299
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,060
A bit of sweet.

300
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,780
The only glass of pinkish wine.

301
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,350
Bonus question!

302
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,100
A senor gentleman in grey hair.

303
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,860
Pure!

304
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,660
It should be white wine.

305
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,300
Senor man.

306
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
Sophisticated.

307
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,860
It surely is aging wine.

308
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,150
The under-brewed wine can’t compare to this.

309
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:29,460
Go! Go! Go!

310
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:29,980
Come on!

311
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,900
20 seconds left!

312
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,380
You still have two cups to go.

313
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,420
Awesome!

314
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,900
What?

315
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,860
Can’t drink anymore?

316
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:51,140
Go! Go! Go!

317
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,980
Come on!

318
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,300
Aside from the different years,

319
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,230
these two glasses of wine don’t show any difference.

320
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,100
Interesting.

321
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,430
I can’t smell it.

322
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,060
Still can’t!

323
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,870
Can’t tell by taste either!

324
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,660
No taste!

325
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,380
How come?!

326
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,220
Why isn’t he moving?

327
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,060
Something’s wrong?

328
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,060
No way!

329
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,310
There’s still time!

330
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,260
Give me the ax!

331
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,060
In 2009,

332
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,380
the ideal weather in Burgundy

333
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,860
created the best condition

334
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,280
for wine growing throughout the region.

335
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,780
In December, 2009,

336
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,020
a severe frost hit the region,

337
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,060
causing the temperature decreased to

338
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,060
minus fifteen degrees from five degrees,

339
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,190
which damaged quite a lot grape vines.

340
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,940
In 2010,

341
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,780
the damp and windy weather

342
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,740
affected the flowering of the grape vines,

343
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,000
leading to poor structure of the grapes.

344
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,440
So, the correct answer

345
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
should be the wine produced in 2009.

346
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,860
Wait!

347
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,500
Struggle!

348
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,670
The desire for life!

349
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,460
Ladies and Gentlemen!

350
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,740
Marilyn!

351
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,940
Thank you!

352
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,380
Why?

353
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,820
Buzui!

354
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,100
Is this how you react to loss?

355
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,500
You’ve just lost three times! Three!

356
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,420
Can’t believe you still have the energy to eat!

357
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,660
You can’t taste any flavor anyway!

358
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,740
Why did you ask me to buy you so much food?

359
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,900
I’m the one should eat

360
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,500
to maximum it’s value!

361
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,310
I’ll eat too!

362
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
I bought the food.

363
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,260
I need to make my money worth!

364
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,140
Let me digest a bit.

365
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,860
It’s too delicious!

366
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,120
I must eat as much as I can,

367
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,260
in case

368
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,940
I’ll lose my sense of taste again tomorrow!

369
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,740
Do you know how long it’s been

370
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,140
since the last time I had boiled pork entrails with cake bits?

371
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,700
Delicious?

372
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,380
Yes!

373
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,550
You can taste it now?

374
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,080
You regained your sense of taste?

375
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:55,940
Come in.

376
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,260
Has Lu Weixun delivered his article?

377
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,260
We should have received it yesterday.

378
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,980
What do you mean by “should have?”

379
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,500
Mi Ya.

380
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,980
The article is very important to the issue of this time.

381
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,220
The magazine is waiting to be printed right now.

382
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,380
If we don’t hear from him,

383
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,620
we’ll be screwed!

384
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,420
We’ve worked with Lu Weixun for a long time.

385
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,900
He has never delayed.

386
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,950
Don’t know what’s wrong this time.

387
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,940
But I trust Lu Weixun.

388
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,220
He won’t delay

389
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,000
unless there’s an emergency.

390
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,220
Are you sure it’s not because

391
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,980
we are not happy about his work this time?

392
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,140
Don’t worry, Chief Editor,

393
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,780
I’ve already had a backup plan.

394
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,840
If I don’t hear from him in three days,

395
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,780
I’ll replace Lu Weixun’s column with something else.

396
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,500
I’ve discovered a new sommelier recently,

397
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,500
who is just as good as Lu Weixun.

398
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,640
I’ve had the draft in my email box.

399
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,270
Do you know why I admire you so much?

400
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,620
Because you are outstanding!

401
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,750
Super outstanding!

402
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,140
If there’s nothing else, I’ll go now.

403
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,660
Sure!

404
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,659
Egg, 240g.

405
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,940
Sugar, 120g.

406
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,500
Cake flour, 120g.

407
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,219
Emulsifier, 10g.

408
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,219
Water, 28g.

409
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,540
Milk, 28g.

410
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,380
Buzui!

411
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,659
I know your sense of taste recovered.

412
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,060
But I think your stomach can’t take it

413
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,659
if you keep eating like this!

414
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,620
The number you dialed…

415
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,500
Sir,

416
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,870
I don’t see a problem with your health.

417
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,820
Miss,

418
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,460
you should pay more attention to your health.

419
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,020
You need to be careful about what you eat!

420
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,700
Doctor,

421
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,380
my sense of taste is back!

422
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,750
I lost my sense of taste.

423
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,220
I didn’t have sense of taste before.

424
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,540
My job requires me to have sense of taste.

425
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,340
I just want to make sure that it won’t be gone again.

426
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,260
Your checkup results are all normal.

427
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,860
Maybe you should go see a psychiatrist.

428
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,980
Doctor,

429
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,940
I don’t have mental disease.

430
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,220
The people who see a psychiatrist

431
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,540
may suffer from psychological problems,

432
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,580
which could cause the loss of sense of taste.

433
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,220
The people nowadays are under a lot of pressure.

434
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,580
They may suffer from

435
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,580
sub-health problems such as

436
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,740
headache, anxiety, tension and insomnia.

437
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,140
Or they may be lack of certain trace elements.

438
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,180
For the sake of safety,

439
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,180
I suggest you make a thorough check!

440
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,140
It’s too desperate!

441
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,380
It makes sense.

442
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,900
But I want to know

443
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,140
how come my sense of taste

444
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,580
came back all of a sudden?

445
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,940
Will it be gone again?

446
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,500
Sir,

447
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,820
I’m with a patient now.

448
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,020
Come with me!

449
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,620
- Could you wait outside?  -What are you doing?

450
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,740
- Let go of me!  -Sir!

451
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,540
Are they sick or not?!

452
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,980
Let go of me!

453
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,380
Go see a doctor if you are sick!

454
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,580
Why are you taking me?

455
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,900
What do you want?

456
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,980
Take a sip.

457
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,400
Tell me the flavor.

458
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,420
Are you crazy?

459
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,740
I’m not a fool.

460
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,950
Why would I drink it?

461
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,230
I’m telling you,

462
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,590
the camera has captured

463
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,740
what you did to me just now.

464
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,380
Don’t you dare hurt me!

465
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,140
What are you doing?

466
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,180
I’ve paid for your car.

467
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,110
This car is imported from Britain.

468
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,440
The damage assessment fee alone would be over 40,000 Yuan.

469
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,980
40,000 Yuan?

470
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,700
Are you blackmailing me?

471
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,020
Take a sip,

472
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,760
we’ll call it even.

473
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,180
Bitter gourd soda!

474
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,340
40,000 Yuan for a sip?

475
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,580
40,000 Yuan for a sip!

476
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,620
Say again!

477
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,340
40,000 Yuan for a sip!

478
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,700
I’ve recorded it.

479
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,620
Drink it!

480
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
How does it taste?

481
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,180
It’s horrible!

482
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,900
If it’s not for that 40,000 Yuan,

483
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,620
I will never drink a gross thing like this!

484
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,420
I’m asking you about the flavor.

485
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,060
I taste a bit of sweet after the bitter.

486
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,390
What’s the percentage?

487
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,260
7% of bitter

488
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,100
and 2% of sweet.

489
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,500
I don’t know where those numbers came from.

490
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,820
They just came out of my mouth.

491
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,260
It won’t affect the compensation fee, right?

492
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,900
Mine!

493
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,940
Yours?

494
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,580
I’ve given it to you.

495
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,380
This is mine!

496
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,700
How did you take it away from me?

497
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Give it back to me!

498
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,340
Are you crazy?

499
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,140
What are you talking about?

500
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,940
I’m not rich, but I have my pride!

501
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,140
I didn’t steal or rob.

502
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,900
Why are you accusing me of taking your stuff?

503
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,060
Don’t slander me!

504
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,460
The most important thing in my life!

505
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,940
What is it?

506
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,340
Give it back to me!

507
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,500
Buddy,

508
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,340
are you kidding?

509
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,940
Don’t pretend anymore.

510
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,380
Don’t tell me that was your first kiss!

511
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,500
Look at you.

512
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,110
You are a grown-up already!

513
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,580
You think you can fool me?

514
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,860
Buddy,

515
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,180
don’t be so sad.

516
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,460
It was just a first kiss.

517
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,260
Actually,

518
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,840
you took my first kiss too!

519
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,380
Let’s forget about it.

520
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,420
Are you going to let me take any responsibility?

521
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,460
First kiss!

522
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,140
You don’t have to be responsible for me.

523
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,380
Even though I was the victim,

524
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,780
I didn’t blame you at all!

525
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,100
You see,

526
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,180
I drank the soda,

527
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,180
and I’ve told you the percentage.

528
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,060
I’m leaving!

529
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,080
What are you doing?

530
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,620
You took my stuff.

531
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,020
You must give it back to me!
