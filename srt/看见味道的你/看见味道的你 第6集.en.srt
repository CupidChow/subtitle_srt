1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720
Am I reduced to the point

2
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,940
where I need your charity?

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,930
You should know who you are.

4
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,160
You should know who you are.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,520
I asked you to leave.

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
No matter what you say,

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,120
I’ll stay.

8
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,600
There’s something that puzzles me.

9
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,600
You mean the blended wine?

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,680
Yes.

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,440
-Is it…  -It’s my order.

12
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
But on one messed about it.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,960
You could tell it was blended wine,

14
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,280
but he couldn’t.

15
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,120
That means he's not capable enough.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,560
According to our agreement,

17
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,840
the Rose Winery is now yours.

18
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,430
I’ll take it delightfully.

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,720
Lu Weixun,

20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,760
this is all you got.

21
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
What are you here for?

22
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
You tell me.

23
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
I can’t find you.

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,040
You didn’t answer my phone calls.

25
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,720
I’m out of money.

26
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,780
Give me some money.

27
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,760
Get lost.

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,680
You do not hesitate giving me money today.

29
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
You may as well give me the card.

30
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,480
What are you doing?

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
-Give me the card.  -Let go of me.

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,079
-What are you doing?  -Give me the card.

33
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,610
-Let go of me.  -Give me that!

34
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,000
Who are you?

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,960
It hurts.

36
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
-He is my brother. -Ouch!

37
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,210
He is my brother. Let him go.

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,520
How dare you touch me?

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,079
Wait and see.

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,040
Are you ok?

41
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,240
Thanks.

42
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,320
Our last piece of news today:

43
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,680
Lu Linong, President of the Lu Group, recently announced that

44
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,080
he would adjust the layout

45
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
of his wine business.

46
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,400
In addition to

47
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,260
the acquisition of three wineries,

48
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,920
he will also change the manager of his wineries.

49
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,920
Previously,

50
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,040
Mu Chunfeng defeated the genius sommelier,

51
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,480
Lu Weixun,

52
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
the young master of the Lu Group

53
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,000
and unexpectedly

54
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,680
became the new owner of Rose Winery

55
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,240
which is owned by the Lu Group.

56
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,360
But,

57
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,000
Rose Winery is not well managed for a long time.

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,960
According to the financial report for the last quarter,

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,690
Rose Winery…

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
Mom,

61
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
the doctor told you to get more rest.

62
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,480
Wouldn't it all right if someone else did the accounting?

63
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
It’s our own business.

64
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,880
I’ll stick to it no matter what.

65
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
How could I let someone else do it so easily?

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,130
Then I’ll have to grow up more quickly.

67
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,240
You’ll surely leave it to me.

68
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,780
I’m waiting for you to grow up.

69
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
It seems that

70
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,880
Lu Weixun and He Buzui are in trouble.

71
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,960
Everybody hits a man who is down.

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,260
There must be some conspiracy behind it.

73
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,760
I’m fine.

74
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,540
But my boss doesn’t seem fine.

75
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,560
I’ve never seen him like this.

76
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,720
He seems depressed and distracted.

77
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,840
Someone like him

78
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,770
may never have lost before.

79
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,560
Yong,

80
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,159
will he recover from this set-back?

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,260
Then I’d lose my job again.

82
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
It’s hard to tell.

83
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,480
I don’t know what happened to him this time.

84
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Talk later.

85
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,960
Hey.

86
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,640
You…

87
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Are you mad

88
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,140
getting drunk in broad daylight?

89
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,720
Where are you going?

90
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
-I need to see her.  -Get out of the way.

91
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,680
Who? Whom do you want to see?

92
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,090
Give me the keys.

93
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Tell me first where you are going.

94
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,120
Give me the keys.

95
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
Do you want to die driving while you are drunk?

96
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,280
Does my life or death have anything to do with you?

97
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,960
Give me.

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
You hired me as a bodyguard.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
I have a duty to protect you.

100
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
I lost my sense of taste.

101
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,720
What else is there to protect?

102
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,520
Give me.

103
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,040
Lu Weixun,

104
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,400
sober up.

105
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,760
Sober up.

106
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
What do you want to do?

107
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,250
I’ll take you there.

108
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,640
If I had known you were coming to a place like this,

109
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,169
I would have left you alone.

110
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,520
You asked for it.

111
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,960
I call this good deed.

112
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,970
A favor as small as a drop of water should be repaid with one as big a surging spring.

113
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,800
Wait for me.

114
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,970
Don’t follow me.

115
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,490
Here you are.

116
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,200
Weixun,

117
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,840
this is

118
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,080
the very first bottle of wine from our Rose Winery.

119
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,140
I’ll give it to you.

120
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,160
Happy birthday.

121
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,200
Mom,

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,240
I’ve memorized all the grape varieties

123
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,880
and all the wine regions.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,660
None of the children who came to study here

125
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,120
is as knowledgeable as me.

126
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,120
You are the best.

127
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,680
I’m so proud of you.

128
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,120
Mom,

129
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,360
I lost.

130
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,200
Are you still proud of me?

131
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,240
You scared me.

132
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,960
In such broad daylight,

133
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,290
I thought it was a ghost.

134
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,640
In such broad daylight,

135
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,370
you didn’t do anything wicked,

136
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,330
why should you be afraid of a ghost?

137
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,160
I am afraid of ghosts,

138
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,300
but I’m not afraid of failure.

139
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
Get in the car.

140
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,880
Is that your mom?

141
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
How do you know?

142
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,660
It’s all over the Internet.

143
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,720
It’s not difficult to get to know you.

144
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,800
But,

145
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
it is not easy, either.

146
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,900
After all it’s just the fringe of you.

147
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,640
You are so annoying.

148
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,060
And I have to meet you in person to know it.

149
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,560
I don't need your approval.

150
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,440
Is the person you care about most

151
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,640
the one you just met?

152
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
All I care about is her approval.

153
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,320
You surely love your mom.

154
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,440
It’s a pity

155
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,020
I can’t remember what my mom looked like.

156
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,240
Your mom…

157
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,560
She passed away when I was a little girl.

158
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,600
My dad brought me up.

159
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,840
You there?

160
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,760
Beidao,

161
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,400
I’m driving.

162
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
How about we eat together tomorrow?

163
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,000
Recently

164
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,240
I’m a bit busy.

165
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,020
Ok. Let’s make it another day.

166
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
Take care.

167
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Talk to you later.

168
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,600
Drive carefully.

169
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,810
How much of your salary is left this month?

170
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,890
About over 600 yuan.

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Where is the rest?

172
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,000
I bought clothes and bags for my girlfriend.

173
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Did I give you money so that you can buy things for her?

174
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
I want to be nice to her.

175
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,820
What’s the use?

176
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,980
Do you have new clothes yourself?

177
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,080
Don’t spend money on women.

178
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,320
She’ll run off with someone else sooner or later.

179
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Go on working.

180
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,860
Heard that?

181
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,600
Yes.

182
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,320
As you see,

183
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
I’m not a good person.

184
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,240
Why?

185
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,080
I quite agree with

186
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,980
what you said just now.

187
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,570
Let’s go.

188
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,730
I’ll buy you a drink.

189
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,880
Hello?

190
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,600
He Buzui,

191
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,810
Lu Weixun is going to be in trouble.

192
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,420
What happened?

193
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,800
I found something

194
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,440
tricky.

195
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,140
Come find me tomorrow.

196
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
I’ll introduce to you someone very important.

197
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,000
We’ll talk then.

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,200
What’s that?

199
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,240
I can’t get out now.

200
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,960
I’ll be worried if I leave him at home.

201
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,740
Then you have more reason to get out and meet with me.

202
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,080
Come out tomorrow

203
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
and we’ll talk face to face.

204
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,660
That’s all.

205
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,560
Hao Yong,

206
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,960
why did you ask me here?

207
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,400
I…

208
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,240
Here. Exchange our ID cards.

209
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,760
Give it to him.

210
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,890
We did that just now.

211
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,840
Who’s he?

212
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,280
This is the VIP today.

213
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,500
His name is Xia Fan.

214
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,000
Xia Fan.

215
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,920
He Buzui.

216
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
How aggressive your name is.

217
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,000
Thanks.

218
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,460
What do you want me for?

219
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,250
You know the fans of my idol call themselves Chihiro, right?

220
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I’m this man.

221
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,880
Like No Face Man,

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
I’ll guard my idol.

223
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
How awesome you are!

224
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,560
Of course.

225
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Please be seated.

226
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
Let’s get down to business.

227
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Where are the things I ask you to bring here yesterday?

228
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,840
Look.

229
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,440
Here is a list of all the media

230
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,080
that covered the follow-up news of this game.

231
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,440
These 32 media,

232
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,160
which had nothing to do with the wine industry,

233
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,490
did not report the game,

234
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,440
but followed up on the news of

235
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,240
the ending of Lu Weixun's cooperation with Dr'Wine.

236
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,880
And their arguments are surprisingly consistent. All of them belittled Lu Weixun.

237
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,640
Look at this.

238
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,069
This is all we media that reported the follow-up news.

239
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,839
All these 78 public accounts

240
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,400
in unison argued that

241
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
my idol does have a gift,

242
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,560
but did not work hard enough.

243
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,240
It is the arguments of these public accounts

244
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,680
that lead those ignorant netizens

245
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,940
to focus all the arguments on this point.

246
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
Your form is too complicated.

247
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,360
I’m lost.

248
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,880
You mean there’s something wrong with it?

249
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,100
He Buzui,

250
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,120
use your brains.

251
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
It’s more than something wrong.

252
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,440
This is a huge…

253
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,320
Sorry.

254
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,900
This is a huge conspiracy.

255
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,140
They want to drive Lu Weixun out of sommeliers’ circle.

256
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,680
Where did you find such a resourceful helper?

257
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,760
It’s right in time.

258
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,980
I'm worried about your safety, miss.

259
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,640
If someone wants to do harm to Lu Weixun,

260
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,970
you’ll be involved too.

261
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,440
Last time you were attacked by his fans.

262
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,240
Who knows what will happen next?

263
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,500
What a good bro.

264
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,720
So,

265
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,280
the most urgent and important thing

266
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,480
is to get Lu Weixun out of trouble.

267
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,340
How about this?

268
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,200
Xia Fan,

269
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,740
send me a copy of your form,

270
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,370
and I’ll take it home to him.

271
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,200
What?

272
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,080
Take it home?

273
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
You know where my idol lives?

274
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,360
I work for him, actually.

275
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,840
So I live in his place temporarily.

276
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,680
What?

277
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,800
You live with him?

278
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,980
Who the hell are you

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,240
to deserve living with him?

280
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Did you take liberties with him?

281
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,100
Calm down. Calm down.

282
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,160
Sit down. Sit down.

283
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,610
Did you take liberties with him or not?

284
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,800
I’m sorry.

285
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,920
Take me there.

286
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,170
I have firsthand information.

287
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,640
Although you said that,

288
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,200
I do not trust you.

289
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,560
Take me to him.

290
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll give it to him myself.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I’ll be there too.

292
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,680
Who do you think

293
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,360
Lu Weixun should believe ? me or you?

294
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,040
As his biggest fan,

295
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,080
heaven and earth can witness my loyalty to him.

296
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,940
What about you?

297
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,560
I…

298
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,480
I am a fan too.

299
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,840
You surprise me every time.

300
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,080
Let’s go.

301
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,840
Wait.

302
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,680
You think you can become his fan just like that?

303
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,980
I have a few questions for you.

304
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
When is his birthday?

305
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Sep. 10th.

306
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,480
The Teachers’ Day.

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,860
I’m impressed.

308
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,440
What’s his favorite color?

309
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,120
Black.

310
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,600
How do you know?

311
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,320
You’re right.

312
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,480
Black is his favorite color.

313
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,520
He appeared in public eighty-nine times,

314
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,440
seventy-two times in a black suit,

315
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,960
sixteen times in a plaid suit,

316
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,490
and only once in a gray suit,

317
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,040
never in a white one.

318
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,280
Right.

319
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,760
White is shallow.

320
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,140
Only some fool like Mu Chunfeng likes it.

321
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,840
Yong.

322
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,640
I really admire you more and more.

323
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,970
You are good at guessing since childhood.

324
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,300
The last question.

325
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,100
What is Lu Weixun's favorite drink?

326
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,840
Bitter gourd soda.

327
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Keep that in mind.

328
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,640
Let’s go.

329
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,960
Get out.

330
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,240
Lu Weixun.

331
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,660
all of you get lost.

332
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,090
Get lost, all of you.

333
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,940
Change your shoes.

334
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
He might not have come back.

335
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,100
Come in and sit down.

336
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,000
Let’s go.

337
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,330
Do remember to keep this place clean and tidy.

338
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Who are you trying to scare off by turning off the lights in the middle of the night?

339
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,520
I thought you were a vampire.

340
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
How can you talk to my idol like that?

341
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,960
This is…

342
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,640
I’m your loyal fan, Xia Fan.

343
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,880
Someone is trying to do you harm.

344
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,080
This is the evidence.

345
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,960
They are just some data.

346
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,920
Idol,

347
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
these abnormal data suggest that

348
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
someone is plotting against you.

349
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,440
If I lost, I lost.

350
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,200
Did you hear that?

351
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,600
You lost

352
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,850
because someone plotted against you.

353
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Who’s this?

354
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,440
I…

355
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,560
He’s my friend

356
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,120
and your…

357
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,080
Fan.

358
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,880
Right.

359
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,920
He’s Hao Yong.

360
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,740
There is some plotting involved.

361
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
But I lost

362
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,000
because of my self-conceit.

363
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,520
Idol…

364
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,680
Idol?

365
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,140
Do I have anything worthy of your liking?

366
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,360
How…

367
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,840
How can you say that?

368
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,900
Do you know how dazzling you were before?

369
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
You are not the Lu Weixun I know.

370
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
Calm down first.

371
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,040
Let go of me.

372
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,880
This is entirely your fault.

373
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,920
He never failed

374
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,100
when he did not have an assistant.

375
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,640
This is entirely your fault.

376
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,320
What did you do to him?

377
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000
Don’t accuse her irrationally.

378
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Mr. Lu lost.

379
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,160
What does that have to do with He Buzui?

380
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,000
How come it doesn’t?

381
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,320
They are destined to be incompatible.

382
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,920
Idol,

383
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,920
all the netizens think

384
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,840
this girl is the cause of your failure.

385
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,040
Fire her.

386
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,560
This is for your own good.

387
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,560
I’ll slap you if you do not stop talking.

388
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,090
Hao Yong.

389
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,680
You are still talking?

390
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,600
Did I say anything wrong? Was I wrong?

391
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,560
What are you doing?

392
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,490
-I am talking…about her. -Enough.

393
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,520
Get out.

394
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,040
-Get out.  -Idol.

395
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,880
It’s really because of He Buzui.

396
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,240
-It’s really…  -Get out, both of you.

397
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,560
Thanks.

398
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,120
Ms.,

399
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,400
what would you like?

400
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,860
Give me a glass of Tequila.

401
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,680
Hello?

402
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,360
Ok.

403
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,200
Ok.

404
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,400
If you insist,

405
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,480
you’ll see the article you want

406
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,000
before 12.

407
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,120
Take care.

408
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,840
Ok.

409
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,400
Ok.

410
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,810
I did not order this.

411
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,280
Ms.,

412
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,680
this is from my boss.

413
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,840
He says

414
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,100
you are more suitable for Tequila Sunrise

415
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,000
than John Collins.

416
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,000
Why?

417
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,680
He said the wine was for lonely people.

418
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,440
Why don't you ask him

419
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,800
for the specific reason?

420
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,360
No need.

421
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,280
I’ll keep the wine.

422
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,540
Thank your boss for me.

423
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,680
Beidao,

424
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,490
give a girl a non-alcoholic Tequila Sunrise.

425
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,120
What is it?

426
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,980
A new routine to get a girl?

427
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,700
It’s getting late.

428
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,940
She shouldn’t drink any more.

429
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,680
Mu Chunfeng.

430
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,940
You replaced my wine with a drink,

431
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,700
and yet you are here drinking.

432
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,240
Don’t.

433
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,810
Is that too much?

434
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,960
As the boss,

435
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
it is necessary to be responsible for the safety of my guests.

436
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,540
I’ll walk you home.

437
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,160
You don't look like someone warm-hearted.

438
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,800
I didn't say I was.

439
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,780
But you take care of our business.

440
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,640
What will happen to our business

441
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,490
if you run into any danger on your way home?

442
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,520
You may go.

443
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,680
I’m home.

444
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,360
Ok.

445
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,000
Since you arrive home safely,

446
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,460
I’ll consider my job done.

447
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,840
No need.

448
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,850
You have to give it back.

449
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,040
You know there's something wrong with that last glass of wine.

450
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,840
There are lots of adverse news about you right now.

451
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,930
I’m not angry about the last drink,

452
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,920
but the conspiracy behind it.

453
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,730
Does drinking help?

454
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,160
That guy is right.

455
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,840
This is a conspiracy.

456
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,300
But there’s nothing I can do about it.

457
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,440
Lu Weixun,

458
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,680
you have been crestfallen for long.

459
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,480
Give me.

460
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,680
Give it to me.

461
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,400
What can I do now besides drinking?

462
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,360
I can't stand it anymore.

463
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,890
Let’s go.

464
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,800
Where?

465
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,650
Climb the mountain.

466
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,040
I’m not going.

467
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,520
No.

468
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,920
You have to listen to me this time.

469
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,360
I really can't do it.

470
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,960
Are you exhausted so quickly?

471
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,050
I want to go back.

472
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,120
No.

473
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,770
Look at the mountain behind us.

474
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,130
You have defeated such a big mountain.

475
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,000
What else can’t you defeat?

476
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,400
Look.

477
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,920
Ahead is the camp site.

478
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,490
Let’s go.

479
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,160
Come, I will help you.

480
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
My sense of taste is not allowed to accept

481
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,160
such rough food.

482
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Your sense of taste is very honest.

483
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,360
Every one of my pores

484
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,640
is nodding in approval.

485
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,680
That is an illusion

486
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,240
because this is the first time

487
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,300
that you’ve tasted this kind of food.

488
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,640
This is not the first time.

489
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,500
I have had a sense of taste before.

490
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,130
How did it disappear later?

491
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,400
When I was young, I was playing at my dad’s winery,

492
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,140
and I accidentally

493
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,240
fell into the wine jar.

494
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,960
When I woke up,

495
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,010
my sense of taste disappeared.

496
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,600
Is he thinking about how to comfort me?

497
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,240
Actually…

498
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,440
No wonder you have such a low IQ.

499
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,050
It turns out that your brain was literarily in water.

500
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,200
I’m not eating any.

501
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,000
Let’s go back.

502
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,520
You have no sense of taste, but you have the appetite.

503
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,580
How can you not eat?

504
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,520
I can feed myself on knowledge and culture.

505
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,040
-Go.  -What?

506
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,530
This is not the way home.

507
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,760
Lu Weixun,

508
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,800
have a try.

509
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,400
The sea breeze is salty.

510
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,480
Have a try.

511
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,880
Like this.

512
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,440
It’s really cool.

513
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,640
Lu Weixun, come back.

514
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,920
I’m here.

515
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,760
I mean the confident,

516
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,120
proud,

517
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,440
and fearless Lu Weixun.

518
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,760
You are like an exquisite vase.

519
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,600
Because you never fell,

520
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,150
you never knew

521
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,230
if you fall on the ground, you will be broken.

522
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,710
But, Lu Weixun,

523
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I believe in you.

524
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,480
If I lost, I lost.

525
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,230
I don't make excuses for my failure.

526
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,440
Sir,

527
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,300
you're only twenty-five.

528
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,840
Why do you talk like an old man?

529
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,240
Are you really going to give up?

530
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,580
If you fall down, are you going to sit there and never get up?

531
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,330
I consider myself strong-willed.

532
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,360
Now my talent is defeated.

533
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,720
Maybe I was never

534
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,240
as good as I thought I was.

535
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,320
Talent is of course important,

536
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,680
but if talent becomes pride,

537
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,600
you will be blinded by it.

538
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I have faith in you.

539
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,700
You’ll be back on your feet again.

540
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,440
Why?

541
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,920
Because you are my boss.

542
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,400
And don’t you want to take back

543
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,720
what’s yours?

544
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Boss,

545
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,800
come back. It’s pay day.

546
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,400
Let’s go.

547
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,000
It’s pay day.

548
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,880
Lu Weixun,

549
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,240
hurry up and have a try.

550
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,120
It does not look good,

551
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,560
but it tastes good.

552
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,760
Are you sure it’s for humans to eat?

553
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,840
I advise you

554
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,240
to be tolerant.

555
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,360
It takes me a lot of efforts.

556
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,200
Will someone invincible like you

557
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,280
be afraid of my discouragement?

558
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,160
You’re right.

559
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,480
I get stronger every time I’m defeated.

560
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,160
Wait.

561
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,920
Where did you find the wine?

562
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,240
In your study.

563
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,440
Did I tell you

564
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,380
not to touch anything in my study?

565
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,400
Bro,

566
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,720
all you get is wine.

567
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
If you won’t even allow me to touch your wine,

568
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,800
you are too mean.

569
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,320
Come. Have a try.

570
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Come.

571
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,760
Have a try.

572
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,290
Have a taste.

573
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,290
It won’t taste good if it gets cold.

574
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,520
I've been stewing this beef for a long time in wine.

575
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,930
Maybe  is your sense of taste

576
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
will come back

577
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,680
when stimulated by the food.

578
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,480
You have to believe in yourself.

579
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,720
It’s one minute already.

580
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,040
Still can’t tell the flavor?

581
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,000
I told you

582
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,200
he is not suited to be a sommelier.

583
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,320
Have a taste.

584
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,660
Here. Have some water.

585
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,920
Don’t worry. Take your time.

586
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,040
Is it Tuscany?

587
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
His sense of taste

588
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,320
is really only sensitive to a single type of wine.

589
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,980
Once the flavors are blended,

590
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,970
he is just like an ordinary people.

591
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,940
He is really not suited to be a sommelier.

592
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,770
Enjoy your meal.

593
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,760
I have to go.

594
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,680
I think dad is right.

595
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,080
Maybe I’m not suited to be a sommelier.

596
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,840
Only if you are brave enough to do

597
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,240
what you think is difficult,

598
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,640
can you make progress.

599
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,080
Life is a journey

600
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,020
where you constantly transcend your bottleneck.

601
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,200
I have faith in you.

602
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,420
You’ll be good.

603
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,840
But dad said…

604
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,200
I think you can.

605
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
You are the best.

606
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,680
Believe me.

607
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,240
There’s new wine

608
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,920
from the Rose Winery.

609
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,200
You are right.

610
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,500
Are you hungry?

611
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,320
It looks like I did a good job.
