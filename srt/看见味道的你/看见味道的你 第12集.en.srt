1
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,930
Come with me.

2
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,680
Every time I get some trouble,

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,000
I meet you.

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,650
Are you sure about doing it?

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,040
For some matters, if I don’t do, I will never feel good.

6
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,720
Yes.

7
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,240
Some matters must be done.

8
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,139
Or else I will never feel good.

9
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
Mr. Lu.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,640
Within this month, the return rate for wines

11
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,500
of Muunas Winery has reached 70%.

12
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,170
Also some regular clients,

13
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,160
it seems that they intend to

14
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,960
terminate cooperation with us.

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
In addition, all brettanomyces we’ve made this year

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,240
don’t make any money.

17
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,280
Finance condition is not optimistic.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,079
It’s hard to support the operation of Rose Winery.

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,480
With the present financial condition,

20
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,440
to operate the two wineries at the same time,

21
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,900
how long will it last in the worst situation?

22
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,600
Half a year.

23
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,810
I’ll find a way out about money.

24
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,080
Anything else?

25
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,640
By the way,

26
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,560
Delegate from WSA will arrive two weeks later.

27
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,420
What do we need to prepare?

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Nothing special.

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
As normal.

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why did my sense of taste lose again?

32
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,480
It means He Buzui’s sense of taste is regained.

33
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,290
I’ll go find her.

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,480
Mr. Ma.

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,480
I gotta go.

36
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,660
Things must have changed.

37
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,360
Beidao.

38
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,080
I’ve got something to do.

39
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,520
I’ll be off.

40
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,930
Come with me.

41
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,610
I want to talk to you.

42
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,480
Beidao.

43
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,900
Would you like one?

44
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,480
Bai, you can leave now.

45
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,560
Okay.

46
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,360
Still thinking about how to help Lu Weixun?

47
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,680
No.

48
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,480
Do you like Lu Weixun?

49
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,800
I don’t know.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,130
Then you do like him.

51
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,560
You treat him differently from how you treat me.

52
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
But I knew you for a longer time than I knew him.

53
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,650
Affection among people

54
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,520
has nothing to do with the length of time.

55
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,080
Buzui.

56
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,580
I would like to ask you a question.

57
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,240
Tell me, is there such kind of person in the world?

58
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,370
When he loves a girl,

59
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
she will be the world.

60
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
He even gives up

61
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,760
his life for her.

62
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,040
What are you thinking about?

63
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,800
What can be more important than life?

64
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,480
What can be more important than life?

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,260
Buzui.

66
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,120
Please take me a bottle of vodka from the warehouse.

67
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,450
I will mix you a new wine.

68
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,800
My younger brother died for an unnatural reason.

69
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
The one who killed him

70
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
is living a happy life.

71
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,890
He was full of true affections.

72
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,300
But he was cast aside like an old shoe.

73
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,659
When we were little children,

74
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,650
my dad was treated unjustly

75
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
and framed up.

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Then he disappeared.

77
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,320
Go.

78
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,360
Yi Nanke.

79
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Yi Beidao.

80
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,040
He Buzui.

81
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
Vodka.

82
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,920
Vodka.

83
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,600
Hello, is that Hao Yong?

84
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
Is He Buzui with you?

85
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,840
No.

86
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,200
She is working in the bar.

87
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,460
She won’t come back before 3 o’clock a.m.

88
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,660
Anybody here?

89
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,240
Please turn on the light.

90
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,360
Little rabbit

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,800
Open the door

92
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
Hurry up

93
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,200
Let me come in

94
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,920
I won’t open the door

95
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,480
Mom hasn’t come back

96
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,120
I won’t open for anyone

97
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Little rabbit

98
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,280
Who’s there?

99
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,800
Me.

100
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,720
Beidao.

101
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,800
Why…Why’s the light off?

102
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
senior

103
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm not your senior

104
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
Beidao.

105
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,040
Beidao.

106
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,840
Why…Why’s the light off?

107
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,540
He Buzui.

108
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
Are you afraid of dark?

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
Great.

110
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,920
I beg you.

111
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,920
Please turn on the light.

112
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,280
- Yes.  - I’m scared.

113
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,010
That’s the way it is.

114
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,000
Who are you?

115
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Who are you?

116
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
Who the hell are you?

117
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,490
What’s the hell do you want?

118
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,880
Yi Beidao.

119
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,440
Yi Beidao.

120
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,400
Yi Beidao.

121
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,900
Your younger brother.

122
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
What kind of person is he?

123
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,440
He is gentle.

124
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,600
Not like me.

125
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Maybe he doesn’t need you

126
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,880
to carry much hatred.

127
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,080
You promised me not to touch her.

128
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,920
Yi Beidao.

129
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,050
Are you alright?

130
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,490
Let’s go.

131
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320
Sir, excuse me.

132
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520
Please drive faster.

133
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,040
Okay.

134
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,250
Are you alright?

135
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,520
I’m useless.

136
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,440
I cannot do it.

137
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,460
The one who died suddenly because of doing too much work

138
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,660
is your elder brother, right?

139
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,760
Yi Nanke.

140
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,800
When I was young,

141
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,170
dad will take my elder brother and I

142
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,580
to take a ride on the merry-go-round.

143
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Dad will also gave me a candy

144
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,720
without mom’s knowledge.

145
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,400
Come back.

146
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,200
Do not let your mom know.

147
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,160
For me,

148
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,540
happiness is living with dad,

149
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,640
Mom

150
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,500
and elder brother.

151
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,100
I’ve ever been the happiest person in the world.

152
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,800
But one day,

153
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,400
dad disappeared.

154
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,240
People said dad

155
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,760
ran off with money.

156
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,720
The police were unable to put on record.

157
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,730
I don’t believe my dad would do such kind of thing.

158
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
He loved us so much.

159
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,730
He wouldn’t abandon us.

160
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,360
A few days later,

161
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,300
He Wangyou came to my home.

162
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,200
He said my dad wouldn’t come back any longer.

163
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,280
I don’t want your money.

164
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Bring Yi back to me.

165
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,320
What are you doing?

166
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,380
Bring Yi back to me.

167
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,240
Did you kill him?

168
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,600
- Did you kill him?  - No.

169
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,530
- Listen to me.  - You are a murderer.

170
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,970
After that, we had lived a difficult life.

171
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
More and more difficult.

172
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,480
Mom.

173
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,340
Let Nanke go there.

174
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
He is clever.

175
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,810
Because of this secret,

176
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,640
we got the same haircut.

177
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,240
I’m a left-hander.

178
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,240
In order to not reveal the truth,

179
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,840
I began to write with my right hand.

180
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,100
I became more and more like my elder brother.

181
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,100
And I got used to being called Yi Beidao.

182
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,840
Sometimes, even my mom cannot recognize us.

183
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,080
The class is boring.

184
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,400
We will have a PE class this afternoon.

185
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,930
Hope we won’t be kicked out.

186
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
He Buzui, wait for me.

187
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,880
When I slowly adapted to this life,

188
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,160
she appeared.

189
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,520
He Buzui,

190
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
the daughter of my enemy.

191
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,080
I knew I hated her

192
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
at first sight.

193
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,440
Have you heard

194
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,320
name of the new comer is very funny.

195
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,960
She is named He Buzui.

196
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,500
Means not getting drunk?

197
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
People said that

198
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,240
they have a winery.

199
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,760
I know it.

200
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,520
She smiles sweetly.

201
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,040
When she ran on the playground yesterday,

202
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,600
Yi Beidao was amazed.

203
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
Tell them what I said to you just now.

204
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,560
I don’t want to attend the next class.

205
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,340
Why?

206
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,890
It’s boring.

207
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,920
Sleep all the time.

208
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
No class is interesting, right?

209
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,860
Let me tell you,

210
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,960
He Buzui’s father’s winery

211
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,210
killed some people.

212
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,700
They killed someone. Yes.

213
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,370
I’ve heard people made trouble at their home.

214
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Yes. I’m ill.

215
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,440
My illness infected.

216
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,440
Do not bully girls.

217
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,300
What are you thinking?

218
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,340
Beidao.

219
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,780
Where is your coat?

220
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,820
Left in the school.

221
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,890
I’ll give you when I find it.

222
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,300
Brother

223
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,160
You never lied to me

224
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,520
all these years.

225
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,720
Today, for such a girl,

226
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,840
will you lie to me?

227
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,400
What?

228
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,740
Do you know who the girl you helped today is?

229
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,540
You went to school?

230
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,680
If it’s found by others…

231
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,440
Answer me.

232
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,400
I know.

233
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,450
You helped her even you knew it?

234
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,560
What her dad did has nothing to do with her.

235
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,100
And she already paid for that.

236
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Did you forget how dad disappeared?

237
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,740
Did you forget how mom became ill?

238
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,560
You forget why we two

239
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,360
couldn’t go to school together?

240
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,850
Do not help her anymore.

241
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,880
You spread the rumor?

242
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,280
Okay.

243
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,600
I promise

244
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I won’t help her.

245
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,810
You, don’t bully her again.

246
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Give me the money.

247
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,620
Brother. You back.

248
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,060
Why did you do that?

249
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,880
You promised not to touch her anymore.

250
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,940
You helped her even you promised not.

251
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,920
What?

252
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,900
Will you beat me for that kind of girl?

253
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,040
You like her?

254
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,760
No. I don’t.

255
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,640
I swear.

256
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,600
I swear.

257
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,580
are you alright???

258
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,400
Alright.

259
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,440
So it’s your elder brother

260
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,280
who liked He Buzui?

261
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,200
After that, Yi Beidao

262
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,480
began to avoid her.

263
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,170
I didn’t bully her as we agreed.

264
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,730
Actually, it’s unnecessary to bully her.

265
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,300
Because after that event,

266
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,770
she was totally isolated by all people in the school.

267
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,840
What you’ve done would make your elder brother feel worse, you know?

268
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,160
I was protecting him.

269
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,960
I already lost my father.

270
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,020
I can’t let them take my brother away.

271
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
The whole family lack of sincerity.

272
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,320
I told you so.

273
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,880
I can’t let my brother get close to He Buzui.

274
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,200
He will be killed.

275
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
It’ll be alright after graduation.

276
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,600
Wait till graduation.

277
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,100
We will leave this city.

278
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,400
He Wangyou and He Buzui

279
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,960
will have nothing to do with us.

280
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,320
See you.

281
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,640
On June 24, 2013,

282
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,820
Nanke’s study will be stable.

283
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,650
I’ve already save enough money

284
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,160
for the tuition and medical fee.

285
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,040
Unexpectedly, He Buzui became a nail in the coffin.

286
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,250
Beidao didn’t give up He Buzui.

287
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,560
He worked very hard for money

288
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,980
to treat her illness of no sense of taste.

289
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
He even wanted to see her on her birthday

290
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,520
for confession.

291
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,100
I will stop him.

292
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,000
I’ll never let them together.

293
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,040
Beidao.

294
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,640
Send this to mom.

295
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,060
Beidao.

296
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,880
Beidao.

297
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,330
How many people do you want to work for?

298
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,080
Your physical condition is so bad.

299
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,600
But you keep earning money for He Buzui.

300
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,720
She is your enemy.

301
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,760
I like her.

302
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,100
I’m willing to do something I can for her.

303
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,980
You don’t understand.

304
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,720
Yes.

305
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,890
I don’t understand.

306
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,200
I don’t understand affection can make you eliminate the hatred.

307
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,100
I don’t understand affection can make you not tell right from wrong.

308
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,300
You don't even care about your own life.

309
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,560
From now on,

310
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,420
I will live in the cafe.

311
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,170
Take good care of yourself.

312
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,130
You will understand me one day.

313
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,540
Alright. Alright.

314
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,520
Don’t cry.

315
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,420
I never thought that when I see Beidao again,

316
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,240
he is dead.

317
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,200
Where were you when that happened.

318
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,000
I was outside.

319
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,680
Do you know the reason?

320
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,760
I don’t know.

321
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,280
Yi Beidao should be alive.

322
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,400
The one who shall die is Yi Nanke.

323
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,280
So,

324
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,840
you pretend you buried Yi Nanke.

325
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,140
You pretend you are Yi Beidao.

326
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,080
But finally,

327
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,960
I can’t become him.

328
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,460
Do you know that

329
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,720
I and Yi Beidao are like the two sides of a coin.

330
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,360
He is light.

331
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
He is so nice.

332
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,540
But I only deserve to live in the dark.

333
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,240
You really think so?

334
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,680
Is it wrong?

335
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,480
People who lives in the dark

336
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,040
can’t see anything around.

337
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,240
But you can.

338
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
I did nothing.

339
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,960
You released He Buzui.

340
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,640
It’s Lu Weixun who took her away.

341
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,360
You are the same as Yi Beidao.

342
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,140
You are both good persons.

343
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,040
- I’m not a good person. - You just got yourself lost.

344
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,920
You just don’t know what you can do

345
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,400
- except for revenge.  - It’s you don’t know.

346
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,600
You don’t know what I have experienced.

347
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
It’s not that complicated.

348
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,320
You don’t know my mother and Beidao…

349
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,920
Not that…

350
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,760
Shut up.

351
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,580
You are the one need to shut up.

352
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,760
Do not be hooked by your own lies.

353
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,840
It’s not a revenge you must take.

354
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Is it worth to take half of your life?

355
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,720
It’s my life. Do not throw your weight around.

356
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:17,960
Fine.

357
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,860
I stop throwing my weight around.

358
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,760
You think about it.

359
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,000
In the school before,

360
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,240
Beidao always helped me.

361
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,250
He even didn’t care about his own life.

362
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,650
Although we haven’t seen for seven years,

363
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,700
he still remembered my birthday.

364
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,440
Why today?

365
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,100
What’s wrong with him?

366
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,000
Why did he want to kill me?

367
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,640
What on earth happened to him?

368
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Are you alright? You…

369
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,040
Did you get hurt?

370
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,800
It’s too late.

371
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,730
I gotta get home.

372
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,290
I can’t let my father worry.

373
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,820
Won’t your father worry if you go home like this?

374
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,280
Wait a minute.

375
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,230
Thank you.

376
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
Thank you

377
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,929
for borrowing money from De for me.

378
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,120
I told Xia Fan not to tell you.

379
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,360
Such a big mouth.

380
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,480
You hate me so much?

381
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,040
You came on time today.

382
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,500
I don’t hate you that much.

383
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,040
Sorry.

384
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
I should come earlier.

385
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,120
Lu Weixun.

386
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,220
What are you?

387
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,420
Come on.

388
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,640
Go home.

389
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,160
But…

390
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,440
I…

391
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,700
No buts

392
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,900
- Lu Weixun, what are you…?  - Your father.

393
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,680
Hello.

394
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,040
Mr. He.

395
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
This is Lu Weixun.

396
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,640
No. No.

397
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,430
I’m not that bastard Yi Beidao.

398
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,640
I’m her boss.

399
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,280
The fact is

400
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,640
we need to work late today.

401
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,680
Buzui will stay in the company.

402
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,720
I’m truly sorry for that.

403
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,520
Please don’t worry.

404
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,280
Buzui is just beside me.

405
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,600
She is too busy to talk to you.

406
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Please don’t worry about her.

407
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,920
She is the most excellent employee

408
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,120
of our company.

409
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,840
Okay.

410
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,480
Good night.

411
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,600
bye bye

412
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,100
The milk is cool. Here you are.

413
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,320
I can’t stand lactose.

414
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,680
You can have it.

415
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,840
Okay. I remember that.

416
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,480
You are doing a good thing.

417
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,880
But you act like a bad guy.

418
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,480
It’s because you sleep in an ugly way.

419
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
I cannot see it.

420
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,120
I know I’m ugly.

421
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,600
Except me,

422
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,380
no one can say you are ugly.

423
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,700
Even you cannot.

424
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,120
Thank you for your food.

425
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,000
But I’m not hungry.

426
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,200
I…

427
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,730
I didn’t prepare it for you.

428
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,600
I can’t eat it,

429
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,040
And it would be pity to throw it away.

430
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,560
So I thought you can eat it.

431
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,860
I didn’t do it especially for you.

432
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
I know.

433
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,680
You won’t cook especially for me.

434
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,040
Who told you?

435
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,920
I did cook especially for you.

436
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,600
Help yourself if it is not enough.

437
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,560
Breakfast is nice.

438
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,700
I’ll wash the bowls.

439
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,040
I’ll be out

440
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,560
You can have a holiday today.

441
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,400
Have a rest at home.
