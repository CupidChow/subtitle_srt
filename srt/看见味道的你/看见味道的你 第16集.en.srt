1
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,500
Here.

2
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,700
Let’s drink.

3
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,620
OK.

4
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,539
Here.

5
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,700
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,100
Dad.

7
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,539
How come my taste is back

8
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,820
all of a sudden?

9
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,820
Your illness has healed.

10
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,540
So your taste recovers.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
But my illness has been treated

12
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,940
for more than ten years.

13
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,100
How come I feel healed all of a sudden?

14
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,780
Because my daughter

15
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,420
is lucky.

16
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,540
Yeah.

17
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,500
Dad, you are right.

18
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,500
I was lucky.

19
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,100
So my taste had recovered

20
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,020
after I drank Pear Blossom.

21
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,940
After you drank Pear Blossom?

22
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,300
No way.

23
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,660
It’s impossible.

24
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,100
It goes

25
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,500
like this.

26
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,420
The Pear Blossom

27
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,540
supplemented some elements to my body,

28
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,100
so my taste recovered.

29
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,940
Do you mean Pear Blossom

30
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,860
restored your taste?

31
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,980
Yes.

32
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,540
So, Pear Blossom

33
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,500
isn’t an ominous wine.

34
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,300
For me,

35
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,820
it is the wine of fortune.

36
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,940
Buzui. But we

37
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,940
can’t brew Pear Blossom.

38
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,260
Think about it.

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,380
We don’t know

40
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,860
how Pear Blossom

41
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,300
will influence human health.

42
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,500
What if it’s harmful to health?

43
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,700
We can’t brew it.

44
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,820
Dad.

45
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,340
Do you remember you took my mom and me

46
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,820
to capture crabs at the seaside?

47
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,140
- Hello! - Hello!

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,100
Be fast!

49
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
Be careful!

50
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,020
The tide is coming! Run!

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,660
Chase it!

52
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,340
Chase the tide!

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,740
Slow down!

54
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,220
- Run faster!  - Be careful!

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,420
- Run faster! The tide is coming!  - Be careful!

56
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,020
Slow down!

57
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Dad and mom, look!

58
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,340
I captured little crabs!

59
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,180
Alright.

60
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,140
Time to go back.

61
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,860
Dad. Are the crabs cute?

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,460
Yes, they are.

63
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,500
Let’s go.

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,340
Mom.

65
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,020
I wanna take them home.

66
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,420
We should go home now.

67
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,220
Little crabs are going home too.

68
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,580
No, I don’t wanna leave them.

69
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
They don’t wanna

70
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,980
leave their family and friends either.

71
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,020
I can be their family and friend.

72
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,620
Are you willing to leave dad and mom?

73
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,340
No.

74
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,140
You are a friend of little crabs.

75
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,140
You don’t want them to be sad,

76
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,860
do you?

77
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,660
Good. Let’s go.

78
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,580
Go home!

79
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Goodbye!

80
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,460
Goodbye!

81
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,340
Bye!

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,460
Good. Let’s go.

83
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,980
My taste

84
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,420
is from my friend.

85
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,620
Since he lost his taste,

86
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,460
his work and life

87
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,100
have been a mess.

88
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Though

89
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,140
I’m unwilling,

90
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,340
I don’t want

91
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,100
my friend to feel upset.

92
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,460
I think my mom

93
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,980
would support me.

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,420
You important!

95
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,380
You can’t take advantage of your mom to persuade me again.

96
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,500
Here.

97
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,940
Cheers!

98
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
My dad was that kind of person.

99
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,940
Don’t mind it.

100
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,420
This tastes good.

101
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,660
Let me open it for you.

102
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,980
Is today Mid-Autumn Festival?

103
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,820
Yes.

104
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,260
You should stay with your family.

105
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
It doesn’t matter.

106
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,420
What stuffing in the moon cake?

107
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,740
Taste it and you’ll know it.

108
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,820
Anyway, you can’t tell the taste.

109
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,100
Let me eat it for you.

110
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,660
Egg yolk.

111
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
What stuffing do you like?

112
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,020
Sweetened bean paste.

113
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
I’m gonna bring one for you.

114
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,020
Forget it.

115
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,700
Anyway, I can’t tell the taste.

116
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
You may eat for me.

117
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,420
I don’t think

118
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,140
it’s a bad thing.

119
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,500
Why?

120
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,140
If I get my taste back,

121
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,900
there will be no operation.

122
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,900
You are selfish.

123
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,860
Miss.

124
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,820
I lost my taste for you.

125
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,580
Am I selfish?

126
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,140
I don’t need your taste.

127
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,540
I hope you can get back,

128
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,300
and your life can return to normal.

129
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,860
You care for me?

130
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,860
I pity you.

131
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,900
I am still mighty

132
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,100
even without my taste.

133
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,900
Don’t look down on me.

134
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,860
So,

135
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,700
all my efforts were in vain.

136
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,580
Did your father agree?

137
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
Yes. I made it.

138
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,380
Mr. He.

139
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,740
Thank you.

140
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,300
Go. Go.

141
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,780
I did it for my daughter. You know it?

142
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,340
Thank you, dad.

143
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,860
How long does it take to brew the wine?

144
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,020
The condition at home

145
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,220
isn’t as good as that in the factory.

146
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,420
It takes time.

147
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,580
But it won’t take long.

148
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,820
About one year.

149
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,340
One year?

150
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,620
We can’t wait for one year

151
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,740
for Rose Winery’s new wine.

152
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,020
Maybe God wants me to give up.

153
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,900
Maybe it’s my fate.

154
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,700
You shouldn’t

155
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,900
resign yourself to the fate.

156
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,260
Besides,

157
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,420
it’s not the worst time yet.

158
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,220
If Pear Blossom

159
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,420
is part of the operation,

160
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,820
I had drunk it

161
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,220
before our first taste change,

162
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,660
and I drank a lot.

163
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,060
What do you mean?

164
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,300
Maybe there’s another way.

165
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,100
Mr. Mu.

166
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,500
You are professional.

167
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,660
Thank you.

168
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,580
We are gonna review it next Monday.

169
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,740
I will review it and give you before Friday.

170
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,900
You are in a good mood today.

171
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,340
Because I feel happy

172
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,540
to cooperate with you.

173
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,340
Lu Weixun cooperated with you.

174
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,660
What do you think of him?

175
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,300
He is a perfectionist, calm and decisive.

176
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,420
But sometimes, he is headstrong.

177
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,100
If he becomes indecisive

178
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,500
all of a sudden, what do you think

179
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,580
the reason is?

180
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,740
You told me this.

181
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,300
Aren’t you afraid I make it public?

182
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
We believe you.

183
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,980
Mr. Mu. Do you mean

184
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,540
the price of new wine

185
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,100
from Rose Winery hasn’t been fixed?

186
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,540
Bingo.

187
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,460
As for Lu Weixun,

188
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,820
the wine may not reach

189
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,100
his standards in some aspects,

190
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,460
Or

191
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,300
he has some secrets that are hard to state.

192
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,140
Do you know when He Buzui

193
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,660
became Lu Weixun’s assistant?

194
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,060
I saw her the first time

195
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,460
when you won Lu Weixun at the contest.

196
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,700
Really?

197
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,460
What?

198
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,060
Do you have interest in his assistant?

199
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,020
Lu Weixun has more interest in her than I do.

200
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,380
I don’t think their relationship

201
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,380
is that simple.

202
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,780
Sorry.

203
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,180
I only focus on my work.

204
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,740
I don’t care about

205
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
any gossip.

206
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,940
If nothing else,

207
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,700
I’ll take my leave.

208
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Interesting!

209
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,420
Idol

210
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,700
This is the wish of fans for Mid-Autumn Festival.

211
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,620
Please fulfill it for us.

212
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,300
No.

213
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,380
idol.

214
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,500
The fans count on me for this.

215
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,940
Now that we need their help,

216
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,860
you may sacrifice yourself.

217
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,940
Amazing!

218
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,380
Alright, stop.

219
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,620
It fits you well.

220
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,100
I am so excited!

221
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,620
I only wear it for ten minutes.

222
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Xia Fan.

223
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,580
Actually, we need your help too.

224
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,620
Rest assured.

225
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
I will do

226
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,860
whatever you want me to do.

227
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,020
Not that serious.

228
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,020
I need you to look for a man.

229
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,660
A man?

230
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,420
Who is it? What’s his name?

231
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,420
The rule is simple.

232
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,380
Drink up

233
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,940
all the wines

234
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,340
within one minute.

235
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,460
If you win,

236
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,460
you get the money.

237
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
If you lose,

238
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,580
you quit the wine community.

239
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,500
The wines on the table

240
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,620
are not ordinary.

241
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,700
They are very strong.

242
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,620
It wasn’t easy for me to get them.

243
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,700
But,

244
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,220
it’s worthy

245
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,100
to challenge you.

246
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,060
I don’t know his name.

247
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500
I didn’t ask him.

248
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,460
But I saw him at the contest.

249
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,740
They called him Mr. Lin.

250
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,740
It means you drank up

251
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,380
nine jars of wines within one minute!

252
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,020
How come you drank all so fast?

253
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,380
That’s my special skill

254
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,700
to survive in the wine community.

255
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,619
So,

256
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,260
did you win the contest?

257
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,740
Of course.

258
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,380
I hadn’t lost any wine contest

259
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,819
before I met you.

260
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,420
Don’t drink like that anymore.

261
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,780
Xia Fan.

262
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,300
Can you find him

263
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,580
by the information?

264
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,620
Robin Bar and Mr. Lin.

265
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,980
I remember it.

266
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,860
Rest assured.

267
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,500
I’m an Internet celebrity.

268
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,140
As long as he is on the earth,

269
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,380
I can definitely find him.

270
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,140
Let’s take more photos.

271
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,500
I’m looking for someone!

272
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,140
Hello, fans in the live streaming room.

273
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,100
Please help me

274
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,860
look for someone named Mr. Lin.

275
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,380
He even challenged Buzui

276
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,780
in Robin Bar.

277
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,500
Mr. Lin. Buzui wanna meet you.

278
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,260
If anyone can provide his contact information,

279
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,460
I’ll reward you five hundred cars

280
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,780
and two hundred yachts.

281
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,980
Thanks a lot.

282
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,900
Love you.

283
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,660
Mr. Lin.

284
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,380
Xia Fan wants you back.

285
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,220
Mr. Lin may be

286
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,940
the most familiar stranger these days.

287
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,700
Your search message on the Internet

288
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,900
really made me a hit.

289
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,780
You are welcome.

290
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,700
It’s the tea Dahongpao.

291
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,180
The tea has the smell of spring.

292
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,020
The fragrance

293
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,140
is rich.

294
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,380
The taste is mellow.

295
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,340
YEN flavour is strong.

296
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
The tea is really good.

297
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,060
I know you are

298
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,380
an unparalleled sommelier

299
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,980
in the wine community.

300
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,140
I can’t believe

301
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,340
you know about tea as well.

302
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,500
I really admire you.

303
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,140
This is...

304
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
This is my idol,

305
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,420
Lu Weixun.

306
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,860
Lu Weixun?

307
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,940
Young master of Lu Group who ran away from home?

308
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,740
I am not a master.

309
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,740
I’m very curious.

310
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,660
Why do you

311
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,380
come to me together?

312
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
Do you have more wines

313
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,540
which I drank last time?

314
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,860
No. You drank all up,

315
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,220
nothing left.

316
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,220
Don’t you remember it?

317
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,660
So, you came here for the wine?

318
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,020
Good taste.

319
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,180
But,

320
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,700
it’s hard to get more.

321
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,500
Yeah.

322
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,060
It hasn’t been produced since twenty years ago.

323
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,420
If we want the wine,

324
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,620
we can only get it from wine fanciers.

325
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,820
Twenty years ago?

326
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,660
Not really.

327
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,220
The wines you drank last time

328
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,540
were the oldest here,

329
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,060
just of five years.

330
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,540
Where did you buy the wines?

331
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,780
The wines aren’t in circulation on the market,

332
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
just in the wine community.

333
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,540
My wines

334
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,820
were given by my friends.

335
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,500
Can you...

336
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,340
You know the rules in the community.

337
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,340
Never ask the source of wine.

338
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
I’ve told you

339
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,660
everything I know.

340
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,580
Have you thrown away the jar

341
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,740
of Pear Blossom?

342
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,380
You are not welcomed here.

343
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,140
I have no interest in your taste-exchange game.

344
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,900
You’d better cooperate with us.

345
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,700
You also wanna know the truth about Pear Blossom.

346
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,300
This is the jar of the wine

347
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,060
which I drank at the contest.

348
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,460
Judged from the smell,

349
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,780
it is the same

350
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,380
as Pear Blossom stored here,

351
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,740
except the aging time.

352
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,940
Your Pear Blossom

353
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,820
was produced twenty years ago.

354
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,460
But this wine

355
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,500
was produced five years ago.

356
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,540
It means

357
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,340
there has been someone

358
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,540
producing Pear Blossom last five years.

359
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,460
But my father closed the winery twenty years ago.

360
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,220
It was also the time when my father

361
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,380
was framed for stealing formulas.

362
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,380
My father hasn’t brewed

363
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,780
Pear Blossom since then.

364
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,860
I haven’t heard from my dad either.

365
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,260
But new Pear Blossom

366
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,820
appears in the market now.

367
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,460
So, the owner of the winery

368
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,540
is either my dad...

369
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,540
Or the murderer?

370
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,780
Where did you get the wine?

371
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,580
It is our only clue.

372
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,260
Village Blossom Pear?

373
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,460
Pear Blossom Village!

374
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,620
Mu Chunfeng. Come here!

375
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,820
What's going on?

376
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,660
How come they are packing?

377
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,700
Is He Buzui kicked out?

378
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,380
Or Weixun will elope with her?

379
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,900
How come they are packing?

380
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,020
What’s going on?

381
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,140
Have a look!

382
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,180
Let me see.

383
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,580
Look.

384
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,820
What’s going on?

385
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,660
Lu Weixun.

386
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,580
Where is Pear Blossom Village?

387
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,420
In Zhao County, Lingnan.

388
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,100
It’s far.

389
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,620
We have to stay there for some days.

390
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,620
They’re going to Zhao County, Lingnan.

391
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,620
They are gonna elope!

392
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,140
I asked Lu Weixun

393
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,780
to go to France with me,

394
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,780
but he refused.

395
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,260
Now he is going to

396
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,500
a weird place with a woman.

397
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,260
What does he wanna do?

398
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,820
We can go there

399
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,380
and see what he wants to do.

400
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,140
Right.

401
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,580
You are not that useless.

402
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,580
Are these clothes enough?

403
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,860
Yes.

404
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,540
We haven’t set off.

405
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,300
You worry too much.

406
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,300
I don’t want you to catch a cold.

407
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,940
You take care of me

408
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,580
if I catch a cold.

409
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,420
Hello.

410
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,460
Mr. Mu.

411
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,220
You ready?

412
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,420
Don’t forget to drink tonight.

413
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,020
OK. Got it.

414
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,900
I remind you.

415
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,980
Get prepared.

416
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,660
Get prepared?

417
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,620
- Cheers!  - Cheers!

418
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,260
Fill up.

419
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,700
Good news.

420
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,740
First,

421
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,020
It’s been five years.

422
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,180
It is

423
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,980
the first time that our monthly magazines

424
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,220
were proofread and distributed

425
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,580
to the printing plant before deadline.

426
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,180
Second,

427
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,660
congratulations that

428
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,860
the sale of the monthly magazines

429
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,980
broke the record this month!

430
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,500
We should

431
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,220
thank Mr. Mu for his contribution.

432
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,140
Mr. Mu.

433
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,260
Here.

434
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,660
Thank you.

435
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,020
My pleasure.

436
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,540
Cheers.

437
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,060
We haven’t had a team building party for a long time.

438
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,700
- Right.  - Right.

439
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,220
Well.

440
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,180
I have a suggestion.

441
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,140
We are gonna have

442
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,180
a three-day party.

443
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,100
The place is up to you.

444
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,420
We set off this week.

445
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,980
- Great! - Great!

446
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,100
Isn’t it too hasty this week?

447
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,900
I can’t go

448
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,260
this week.

449
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,180
I’m not free this week.

450
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,700
We can discuss it later.

451
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,380
Anyway, I’m not looking forward to it.

452
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,780
It is just a delay.

453
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,180
We can go at another time.

454
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,220
Mr. Mu.

455
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,100
Look.

456
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,220
Don’t spoil it.

457
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,740
How about

458
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,300
we go to Zhao County in Lingnan?

459
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,500
There are tens of thousands of pear trees.

460
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,060
The pear harvest is spectacular.

461
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,980
To Zhao County?

462
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,340
- Zhao County?  - To Zhao County?  - Alright.

463
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,300
Then we listen to Mr. Mu

464
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,140
and go to Zhao County!

465
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,540
Zhao County!

466
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,580
Here.

467
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,020
Cheers!

468
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,700
Buzui. Want some water?

469
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,180
I’m not thirsty.

470
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,340
Mr. Yi. You want some?

471
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,500
You are here to look after He Buzui.

472
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,580
Don’t worry about me.

473
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,460
Buzui.

474
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,340
I have snacks.

475
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,580
Want some?

476
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,060
I’m not hungry.

477
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,220
The taxi behind

478
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,900
has been following us.

479
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,380
Don’t care about it.

480
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
Did he discover us?

481
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,420
Should we still follow them?

482
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,860
Yes.

483
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,820
Hey.

484
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,380
We are going out of the city.

485
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,380
What are you doing?

486
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,300
You know nothing.

487
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,100
I’m crazy for my love.

488
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,180
See the man who is driving?

489
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,100
He is my fiancé

490
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,260
But he was bewitched

491
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,100
by a woman and betrayed

492
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,140
our oath.

493
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,300
He is a love rat!

494
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,700
Let’s chase her.

495
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,660
Love rat?

496
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,740
You are the love rat.

497
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,900
Look at the scar on your face.

498
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,140
It must be scratched by a shrew.

499
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,420
I have many stories.

500
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,820
Cut the crap.

501
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,580
Catch up with them!

502
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,180
No problem.

503
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,980
There.

504
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,820
This place is nice.

505
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,940
All of them should come with us.

506
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,340
But the four kids ate barbecue

507
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,660
the night before

508
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,820
and had diarrhea.

509
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,220
So they asked for leave

510
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,260
and couldn’t come.

511
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,460
It’s rare to have a party together.

512
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,180
What a pity.

513
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,420
I don’t think

514
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,940
we are here purely for the party.

515
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,660
Why don’t you believe

516
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,460
I purely take you here to enjoy yourselves?

517
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,500
Because you are not trustworthy.

518
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,060
I’m not a fool.

519
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,260
Thank you, Chief Editor.

520
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,580
You are welcome.

521
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,380
Mr. Lu!

522
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,580
What a coincidence

523
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,300
Mi Ya. How come you are here?

524
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,340
We’re here for a team building party.

525
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,580
Excuse me.

526
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,660
I’m Wan Zeze, the boss of the hotel.

527
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,860
You can take a rest

528
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,380
in the hotel when you park the car.

529
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,620
Thank you.

530
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,540
Mr. Mu. Let’s go first.

531
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,340
Sir.

532
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,700
There are parking spaces behind.

533
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
May I take you there?

534
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,900
Your friends can handle the luggage first.

535
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,940
OK.

536
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Thank you, sir.

537
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,540
Let’s go this way.

538
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:36,980
OK.

539
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,780
It’s not far.

540
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,420
Sir.

541
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,580
By the way,

542
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,180
do you make porcelain here?

543
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,580
Porcelain?

544
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,500
Let me see.

545
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,420
This was made by me.

546
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,020
You made it?

547
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,460
Yes.

548
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,860
When I am free in the hotel,

549
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,300
I make wine vessels and tea wares to kill time.

550
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,980
Did you brew the wine as well?

551
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,940
No.

552
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,180
I was entrusted by wine dealers.

553
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,020
Where are the wine dealers?

554
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,220
They are not here,

555
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,300
but not far away.

556
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,500
They have a holiday

557
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,700
for Pear Blossom Festival.

558
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,020
Can you tell us the address?

559
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,460
We want to visit it.

560
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,380
The management

561
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,340
of the winery is strict.

562
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Only staff can get in.

563
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,660
You want to go...

564
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,700
We want to buy wines.

565
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,580
You are wine hobbyists.

566
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,780
Well, my wine stock

567
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,900
runs out as well.

568
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
You can go with me

569
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,060
when the Pear Blossom Festival ends

570
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,380
after several days.

571
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,020
I need to buy some wines to stock.

572
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,020
OK.

573
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,500
Thank you, sir.

574
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,780
OK. This way, please.

575
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,980
- This way.  - OK.

576
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,020
Thank you.

577
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,140
Mr. Mu. Let’s go.

578
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,500
We have checked in. See you.

579
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,820
We have to stay here for three days.

580
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:09,820
Why?

581
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,860
All wineries are closed for Pear Blossom Festival.

582
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,139
Hello.

583
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,380
We need four rooms.

584
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,500
Sorry, sir.

585
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,139
We only have two double-bed rooms.

586
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,659
What should we do?

587
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,179
And the room was just checked out

588
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,900
by a gentleman.

589
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,780
Is there any other hotel nearby?

590
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,980
Due to the Pear Blossom Festival,

591
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,620
rooms are in short supply.

592
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,860
No rooms available in other hotels too.

593
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,699
What shall we do then?

594
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,780
Sir.

595
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,820
Check in.

596
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,060
Bai Jing?

597
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,620
Why are you here?

598
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,740
I come to travel.

599
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,340
Do you know each other?

600
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,380
Yes.

601
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,140
You two girls can share a room.

602
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
And three gentlemen can be in one room.

603
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
It’s OK for me.

604
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,980
Me too.

605
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,740
I don’t agree.

606
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,700
Then we two in one room.

607
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,700
You three in another one.

608
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,020
- No.  - No.

609
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,380
Of course not.

610
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,460
So small.

611
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,740
Let’s make a deal.

612
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
This bed is yours.

613
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,020
This is mine.

614
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,260
Don’t come here.

615
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,260
Fine.

616
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,140
You should follow the rule too.

617
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,260
Of course.

618
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,860
Besides,

619
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,060
don’t touch my things.

620
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,820
I won’t.

621
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,180
Eyesore.

622
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,340
What did you say?

623
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,820
I said my phone is out of battery.

624
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,940
That’s my socket!

625
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,420
I’ll return it to you later.

626
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,780
You are ridiculous!

627
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,860
You can’t use it!

628
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,180
Ms. Bai.

629
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,700
Can you be reasonable?

630
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,380
Does it have your name?

631
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,940
That’s mine!

632
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,060
Don’t use it!

633
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,500
Alright, it’s mine now.

634
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,820
Do we sleep here?

635
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,580
I sleep here.

636
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,220
I’m sleepy.

637
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,620
Wan Zeze said his father is Wan Ran.

638
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,860
What a coincidence!

639
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,780
His father even worked in our winery.

640
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,420
I find this place is weird.

641
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,980
How come?

642
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,700
Wan Zeze is weird.

643
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,300
Did you know him before?

644
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,820
No.

645
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,460
But Mr. Wan loved him very much.

646
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,900
It’s said that Wan Zeze

647
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,740
was in poor health when he was young.

648
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,500
Mr. Wan saved money

649
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,220
and took him abroad

650
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,500
to have a surgery.

651
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,860
It seems his illness

652
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,380
has been cured.

653
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,940
Mr. Wan lived with him in the mountains

654
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,900
because of his illness.

655
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,500
Wan Zeze was in poor health

656
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,700
and had a surgery abroad.

657
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,820
Did Wan Ran make big money in the winery?

658
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,660
No. Our winery was small.

659
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,740
They just made some money to get by.

660
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
How could he afford the surgery abroad?

661
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,340
I don’t know.

662
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,220
We hadn’t heard from him

663
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,540
since he left the winery.

664
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,940
Is the salary of the hotel manager high?

665
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,140
Not really.

666
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,060
The promotion in Wanjia Hotel is hard.

667
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,420
It takes many years

668
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,060
to be General Manager.

669
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,180
And the initial salary was not necessarily high.

670
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,780
How do you know that?

671
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,020
It isn’t your hotel.

672
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,140
- No.  - Why?

673
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,340
- Is it different?  - Yes.

674
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,540
- It...  - Does it have a special smell?

675
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,260
Yeah.

676
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,780
Hello.

677
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,060
Would you like some tea?

678
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,460
It’s oily.

679
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,900
Enjoy yourselves.

680
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,380
You want some?

681
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,940
No, thank you.

682
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,980
Bye.

683
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Do you suspect

684
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,820
someone makes Pear Blossom here?

685
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,540
Where is Mr. Mu?

686
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,580
Aren’t you inseparable?

687
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,220
We are inseparable in work,

688
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,820
not in life.

689
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,460
I don’t think so.

690
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,780
You care about it?

691
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,980
I’m joking.

692
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,500
How come you come here together this time?

693
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,500
We have no eternal allies,

694
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,860
and no perpetual enemies.

695
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,300
I think,

696
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,500
what inside the jar is not necessarily wine.

697
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,860
It has been a long time

698
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,900
and the smell is gone.

699
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,660
How do you know it isn’t wine?

700
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,660
It seems sour.

701
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,380
It could be vinegar.

702
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,740
Vinegar?

703
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,180
They are four people

704
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,900
and all interested in Pear Blossom.

705
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
I promised to take them there

706
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,780
after two days.

707
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,420
OK.

708
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,580
May I help you?

709
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,740
Mr. Wan.

710
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,820
Can you tell me

711
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,260
who brews Pear Blossom?

712
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,940
This is their commercial secret.

713
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,860
I don’t know it.

714
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,140
I can’t disclose it

715
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,140
even if I know.

716
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,500
What kind of person is he?

717
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,580
The owner of winery is a man.

718
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,780
What’s his surname?

719
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,180
Yang.

720
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,820
I promised to take you there.

721
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,300
You will meet him.

722
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,060
Thank you.

723
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,420
Did you get anything?

724
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,340
I heard him calling someone else.

725
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,820
He told that man

726
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,580
we were looking for Pear Blossom.

727
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,820
This man is suspicious.

728
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,580
We’d better be careful.

729
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,500
I think

730
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,100
we can find a way to try him.

731
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,140
We should learn about his character first.

732
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,300
How about drinking?

733
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,420
No.

734
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,140
He doesn’t have a good health.

735
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,420
He won’t drink much.

736
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,340
Play cards.

737
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,580
It can show his character.

738
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,260
Good idea.

739
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,620
I agree.
