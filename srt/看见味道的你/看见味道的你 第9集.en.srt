1
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,060
Mr. Lu.

2
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,120
This is my home.

3
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,150
What do you want?

4
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,310
You candid freak. Do not hurt He Buzui.

5
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Or else, I’ll give you a good lesson.

6
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,900
Can you leave now?

7
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,740
You answer my phone finally.

8
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,980
Lu Weixun is looking for you everywhere.

9
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,940
Yong.

10
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,660
You are on my side, aren’t you?

11
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,740
Buzui.

12
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,100
I am on your side

13
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,100
forever.

14
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,180
But you went too far this time.

15
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,660
He broke my bottle.

16
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
But you broke his heart.

17
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,700
He gave you a day off

18
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,780
and invited me there,

19
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,140
so as to prepare

20
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
for your birthday party

21
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,510
and give you a surprise.

22
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,060
He really changed a lot.

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,630
I see his changes in my eyes.

24
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,580
But you lied to him,

25
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,420
and dated with Beidao.

26
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,300
Date? What date?

27
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,240
You misunderstood me.

28
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,460
You should explain it then.

29
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:19,940
Buzui.

30
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,260
If you don't wanna work for him,

31
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,700
you can cancel the contract

32
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,360
and make money in another way.

33
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,300
But if you are unhappy,

34
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,180
I’ll feel sad too.

35
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,780
Alright.

36
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,020
I got it.

37
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,420
Give me some time.

38
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,100
OK.

39
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,630
What do you want?

40
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,940
- I wanna see my dad!  - I wanna see Yi Jianguo.

41
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,060
- You shall not get in!  - I’m his wife!

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,860
- You shall not get in!  - I wanna see Mr. He!

43
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,580
- You shall not get in!  - You are not allowed!

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,020
- You shall not get in!  - Let go of my mom!

45
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,780
Let go of my children! Let go of them!

46
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Yi Jianguo stole the wine formula and ran away.

47
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,100
He left his wife and children behind.

48
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,060
So hateful he is.

49
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,540
His wife and children

50
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,870
are so pathetic.

51
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,660
Beidao.

52
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,140
What brings you here?

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,700
What?

54
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,740
You don’t welcome me, do you?

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,580
Yes,

56
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,140
welcome here.

57
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,460
Your work must be tiring.

58
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,140
I’m used to it.

59
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,800
You shouldn’t do two jobs.

60
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,220
I know that job

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,620
is kind of weird,

62
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,540
and you can’t accept it.

63
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,780
Anyway, this is my choice.

64
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,780
It is also

65
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,700
a test for myself.

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,700
I wanna take the responsibility for it.

67
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,750
You are still stubborn.

68
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,780
I’m sorry but

69
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,270
I have to refuse you.

70
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,720
It doesn't matter.

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,900
I can wait for you.

72
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,740
Thank you, Beidao.

73
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,600
Won’t you invite me in?

74
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,380
Let’s go.

75
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,740
Dad!

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,260
Your nose is as sensitive as a dog.

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,920
Did you smell the watermelon?

78
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,909
Yes, my nose is very sensitive.

79
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,240
This is...

80
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,750
This is my senior at school, Yi Beidao.

81
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,060
He resembles...

82
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,360
Whom does he resemble?

83
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,470
He resembles...

84
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,460
He resembles...

85
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,180
My dad is old.

86
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,700
Don’t mind it, Beidao.

87
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,940
Come. Sit.

88
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,100
Take a seat.

89
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,160
Help yourself.

90
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,380
Beidao.

91
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,660
Have watermelon.

92
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,620
Mr. He.

93
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,100
Do you brew wines now?

94
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,260
No, I don’t.

95
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,420
It’s ominous.

96
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,900
Your misfortune

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,750
is that my father stole your wine formula.

98
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,940
But your misfortune

99
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,700
also made my family live in pain.

100
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,260
Please take it.

101
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,420
If you see him,

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,460
please call me.

103
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,380
OK.

104
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,340
Have you seen this man before?

105
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,100
No, we haven't.

106
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,140
- Really?  - No.

107
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,110
Be careful, mom.

108
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,740
Beidao.

109
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,700
No need to cut. These are enough.

110
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,340
Buzui.

111
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,520
Where is the bathroom?

112
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,260
In that room.

113
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,780
Excuse me.

114
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,940
Have the watermelon.

115
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,720
I’m gonna make dishes.

116
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,140
Dad. Beidao is here.

117
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,000
Make some more.

118
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,940
Beidao.

119
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,020
You are looking at my photos?

120
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,180
Look.

121
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,360
I was so lovely when I was a kid.

122
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,130
Buzui.

123
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,179
Who is this?

124
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,820
This is my dad's colleague in the winery.

125
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,980
But I haven’t seen him since I grew up.

126
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,740
Let’s go to have lunch.

127
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,350
Why do you come here?

128
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,760
Go back with me.

129
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,100
Let her go.

130
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
You should let her go.

131
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,310
You wanna fight?

132
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,940
Another schoolmate?

133
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,320
Are you playing games?

134
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,020
Dad.

135
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,580
We are playing tug-of-war.

136
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,500
Tug-of-war?

137
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,540
Good.

138
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,060
Let me be the referee.

139
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,300
You hurt me! Let me go!

140
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,820
Let her go! You hurt her!

141
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,060
Dad.

142
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,180
Take care of Beidao.

143
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,380
I’ll be

144
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,580
right back.

145
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,660
You,

146
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,460
go with me.

147
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,620
Don’t you have lunch?

148
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,070
Come. Let’s have lunch.

149
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,340
Sorry.

150
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,820
I'm gonna make dishes.

151
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,780
What the hell are you doing?

152
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,640
Go back with me.

153
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
I won’t.

154
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,580
You can’t tell good from evil, can you?

155
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,380
You are right.

156
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,030
I can’t tell good from evil.

157
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,780
I wrongly take you as a good person.

158
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,780
Don’t you know he is deliberately investigating you?

159
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,180
You are deliberately oppressing me.

160
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,420
They are two different matters.

161
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,100
Don't be so pigheaded.

162
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,820
You’d better leave

163
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,740
if you want to argue with me.

164
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,860
I’m busy today.

165
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,380
Buzui.

166
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,990
Come and have lunch!

167
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,220
I’m hungry.

168
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,420
I’m gonna have lunch.

169
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,740
You...

170
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,380
Don't go there.

171
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,460
Have some more.

172
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
My cooking skills are good.

173
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,060
Try it. Try it.

174
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,540
Mr. He, your skills are impressive.

175
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,470
You used superior honey mushrooms

176
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,220
and simmered them in chicken soup

177
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,150
for three hours.

178
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,980
You also added Chinese medicinal materials.

179
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,420
Your taste is awesome.

180
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,470
It’s good, isn’t it?

181
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,740
Eat some more.

182
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,740
Lu.

183
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,820
Try it.

184
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,020
Can you tell other Chinese medicinal materials

185
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,780
I used in it?

186
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,820
Dad.

187
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,180
He has a cold

188
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,350
and can’t eat these.

189
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,920
Eat some vegetables then.

190
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
These vegetables

191
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,900
don’t look good,

192
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,420
but the sauce

193
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,470
is made based on my secret formula.

194
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,380
This is

195
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,550
made from potato and eggplant?

196
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,860
Buzui.

197
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,980
Go out with me.

198
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,540
What for?

199
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,340
It’s about work.

200
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,380
Lu Weixun.

201
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,820
It’s just a common meal.

202
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
You couldn’t tell the ingredients,

203
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,400
but it doesn’t matter.

204
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,740
It’s not a big deal.

205
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,460
I can’t lose to Yi Beidao.

206
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,660
What do you want?

207
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,940
You want to...

208
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,180
You...

209
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,820
Don’t come here.

210
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,100
I want them to know

211
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,540
what the top taste is,

212
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,340
and what the unparalleled taste is.

213
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,940
Are you crazy?

214
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
You wanna do that

215
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,620
to

216
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,100
compete with him?

217
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,740
Yes.

218
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
I’m the boss.

219
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
It’s up to me.

220
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,980
Eat the food.

221
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,200
The food gets cold.

222
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,430
Please listen to me, Mr. He.

223
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,940
This dish used

224
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,580
wild honey mushrooms from Changbai Mountains,

225
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,060
decocting with hen.

226
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,860
The Chinese medicinal materials are angelica,

227
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,500
cordycepin, yam and gorgon euryale seeds.

228
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
The dish is sweet and slightly sour.

229
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,860
But I don’t know

230
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,540
why it has the taste of garlic.

231
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,820
You must be wrong.

232
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,120
How come it has garlic?

233
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,420
Yes,

234
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
you are right.

235
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,020
One clove of garlic

236
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,060
fell into the pot accidentally,

237
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,800
and I took it out immediately.

238
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,900
I can’t believe you taste it.

239
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,260
Awesome! Awesome!

240
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,580
Have the food.

241
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,420
Rose Winery is worthy of its reputation.

242
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,900
The aroma is also amazing.

243
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,300
Master, what’s the matter?

244
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,780
I intend to visit you.

245
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,860
No need.

246
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,040
What about your preparation?

247
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,500
Since the last competition,

248
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,420
I’ve been preparing my taste.

249
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,260
What on earth does he want?

250
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,220
Rose Winery.

251
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,180
Master, please rest assured.

252
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,220
I won’t allow

253
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,860
Lu Weixun to take anything from me.

254
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,220
OK.

255
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,940
Hello?

256
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,780
I’m sorry, Mr. He.

257
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,140
I have some work to do.

258
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,700
I should go back with Buzui.

259
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,500
Next time,

260
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,020
I will cook dishes for you myself.

261
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,300
OK. See you.

262
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,140
I won’t.

263
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,380
What?

264
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,420
Your boss has work for you.

265
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,780
I haven’t finished my food.

266
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,820
Don’t eat. Go now.

267
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,420
I’m still hungry.

268
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,160
You can go back and eat enough.

269
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,380
Beidao.

270
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,190
Help yourself. Have some more.

271
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,420
Help yourself.

272
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,580
What happened to him?

273
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,540
Does he suffer senile dementia?

274
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,300
He Wangyou.

275
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,380
Whatever,

276
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,980
you will pay for your sins.

277
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,860
Mr. He.

278
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,900
Come to play Chinese chess with me.

279
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,700
Wait a while.

280
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,870
I’ll go after lunch.

281
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,020
Mr. He.

282
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,940
I’ll take my leave.

283
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,390
Are you gonna leave?

284
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,940
You didn't eat much.

285
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,020
See you.

286
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,500
Bye.

287
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,780
So much food is left by them.

288
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,140
You are childish.

289
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,540
Do you really think a kiss can exchange the sense of taste?

290
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,180
Whatever,

291
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,900
I got praised by your father.

292
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,270
It’s worthy.

293
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,380
Lu Weixun.

294
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
I can’t understand your values.

295
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,700
You kissed me, just because you were

296
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,740
mad at Beidao.

297
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,700
Do you know

298
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,620
it’s very childish of you

299
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,140
to do that?

300
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,740
How come I have a boss like you?

301
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,420
I’m your boss. It’s up to me.

302
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,140
Childish.

303
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,620
You repaired it?

304
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,900
Yes, it’s a piece of cake.

305
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,820
I forgive you.

306
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,540
As your good boss,

307
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,700
I showed my top taste

308
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,140
to your dad.

309
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,540
If I lose in the competition

310
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,220
with Mu Chunfeng,

311
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,940
your debt will be doubled.

312
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,980
You are unreasonable.

313
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,980
You did it for me?

314
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,840
Obviously you are vainglorious.

315
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,980
It's you who have an affair with that guy.

316
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,660
You are petty.

317
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,300
You didn’t follow the rules.

318
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
Mr. Mu is coming soon.

319
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,460
Get ready.

320
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,660
How do I look?

321
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,180
Pull the shirt up.

322
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,900
Hello, Mr. Mu.

323
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
This way, please.

324
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,780
Please.

325
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,860
This is Mr. Mu.

326
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,740
We are honored

327
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,100
to have Mr. Mu here

328
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,260
for the interview

329
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,860
before the competition.

330
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,980
Mr. Mu.

331
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,760
- Thank you.  - My pleasure.

332
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,820
I think

333
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,580
it’s necessary to have relaxation before competition.

334
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,500
Right. Right.

335
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,300
Your performance in the last competition

336
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,430
was really amazing.

337
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,080
I believe you will win the next competition!

338
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,300
Yes, that’s right.

339
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,430
Mr. Mu. Sit, please.

340
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,540
- OK.  - Here.

341
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,620
Let's get started.

342
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Cabernet Sauvignon, 2007.

343
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,910
How long did it take?

344
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,880
16 minutes and 24 seconds.

345
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
It’s too long.

346
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,900
The accuracy is 100%.

347
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,700
We only have two weeks

348
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,830
before the competition with Mu Chunfeng.

349
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,620
We must improve the speed

350
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,420
by 50% within two weeks.

351
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,990
But it’s not realistic.

352
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,420
What should we do?

353
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,580
We must finish the competition within 10 minutes.

354
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,260
How about we give up the five glasses of blended wines?

355
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,580
I won’t give up any wine.

356
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
So, we have to improve other speeds.

357
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,180
Other speeds?

358
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,940
Writing speed.

359
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,900
Improve your writing speed within two weeks.

360
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,100
Are you serious?

361
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,060
It’s like

362
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,990
the training for athletes before competitions.

363
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
The physical training

364
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,260
can improve your reaction capability.

365
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,500
You should adjust

366
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,180
your physical condition to the best.

367
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,800
I can’t believe

368
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,580
you blockhead

369
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,380
are smart at a critical moment.

370
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,260
You...

371
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,940
You are blockhead.

372
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,380
You... You...

373
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,020
I... I’m sorry! I am wrong!

374
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,340
It’s my fault...

375
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,540
I hate exercises.

376
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,620
Do you wanna win?

377
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,820
Don’t be lazy.

378
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,260
Continue.

379
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,300
Increase the difficulty

380
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
of the training.

381
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,780
Run!

382
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,120
You just run for a few minutes.

383
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,980
Abdominal muscles.

384
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,580
Use your abdominal muscles.

385
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,500
Add a 5 kg weight.

386
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,430
You can do it.

387
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,500
Do it.

388
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,620
Go back

389
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,300
and take a bath.

390
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,300
Relax your muscles.

391
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,660
Don’t boss me around.

392
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,220
I’m gonna have a drink

393
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,460
to relax myself.

394
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,900
You are not tired at all.

395
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,460
You should give me a raise.

396
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,580
I treat you to drinks.

397
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,580
Let’s go!

398
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,700
What are you hiding from?

399
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,420
Lu Weixun.

400
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,020
You are up to no good.

401
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,380
We have a drink at Yi Beidao’s bar.

402
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,620
Isn’t it good?

403
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,240
Do you feel guilty?

404
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,870
I did nothing wrong.

405
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,550
I’m not afraid of anything.

406
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,940
Let’s go.

407
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,480
Don’t stand there.

408
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,820
Welcome.

409
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,020
Aberlour original.

410
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,420
Cask No. 39.

411
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,980
On the rocks.

412
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,540
You serve it too early. Not cold enough.

413
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,580
I forgot to tell you that

414
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,150
I wanna drink it slowly.

415
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Please use the spherical ice cubes.

416
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,380
Lu Weixun!

417
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,500
Beidao.

418
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,940
Ignore him.

419
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,660
What do you want?

420
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,980
I just want a drink.

421
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,000
Please don’t make any trouble for me.

422
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,940
I don't want

423
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,460
any accident.

424
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,020
I don’t want my sense of taste taken by others

425
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,500
before the competition.

426
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,500
I have to supervise you.

427
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,460
Margarita.

428
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,380
It’s so good.

429
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,700
Tequila from Mexico,

430
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,990
blended with fragrant Cointreau.

431
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,660
The taste is tender,

432
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,260
and also slightly sour of lemon.

433
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,740
The wine seems to have

434
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,900
salt?

435
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,840
It’s said that the original maker is Dureza.

436
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,020
Margarita is his deceased lover.

437
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,300
Margarita loved salty food,

438
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,760
so he added the salt into wine.

439
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,060
This wine

440
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,580
is for lovers.

441
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,420
Lovers?

442
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,780
Lovers?

443
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,300
Let me show you what your

444
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,220
romantic schoolmate has done.

445
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,500
Go with me.

446
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,660
You don't believe he is up to no good.

447
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,280
- Look at it yourself.  - Are you crazy?

448
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,780
Mr. Lu.

449
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,110
You have no manners.

450
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,740
You are a good liar.

451
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,260
Your deeds are nasty.

452
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,780
Do you think others are like you?

453
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,100
Your purpose is exposed,

454
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,780
so you try to frame others.

455
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,980
You hypocrite!

456
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,940
No one can break my relationship

457
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,100
with He Buzui.

458
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,080
The truth will come to light sooner or later.

459
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,940
Enough!

460
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,420
Lu Weixun!

461
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,700
Don’t be conceited.

462
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,100
If not Yi Beidao,

463
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,910
I wouldn’t have come to this point.

464
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,260
Even if he has evil intention,

465
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,180
I don’t care.

466
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,140
Idiot!

467
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,820
Senior

468
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,580
I’m sorry for the trouble.

469
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,320
Never mind.

470
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,740
I’m happy

471
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
for what you said.

472
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,100
I’m leaving.

473
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,620
Take care.

474
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,620
Buzui.

475
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,260
Why didn’t you answer the phone?

476
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,990
Are you back?

477
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,700
Yes, I’m back.

478
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,020
Yong.

479
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,780
I feel so tired.

480
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,180
What’s wrong?

481
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,980
It’s totally a mess.

482
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,310
Think about 2 million yuan.

483
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,820
When will it end?

484
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,300
When the competition is over,

485
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
the contract will be terminated,

486
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,430
and you will be free.

487
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,940
Competition?

488
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,340
I wonder if we can win it.

489
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,260
I’m gonna see you tomorrow.

490
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,340
I have new information

491
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,460
about Mu Chunfeng.

492
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,260
Mu Chun...

493
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,700
Brandy

494
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,020
is a white wine produced by Marquis de Haux.

495
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,540
The taste is pungent and heavy,

496
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,300
aging in Sauvignon Blanc barrels.

497
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,860
It’s also known as Jealousy Wine.

498
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,820
It’s sour!

499
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,780
So sour!

500
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,900
Who are you jealous of?

501
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,620
For the girl upstairs?

502
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,100
Do you know her?

503
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,860
I know what you are thinking.

504
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,620
You are angry because she doesn't believe you.

505
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,900
Angry?

506
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,140
I just worry about my sense of taste.

507
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,220
People tend to be fooled by the appearance.

508
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,560
You are obviously worried about her.

509
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,820
As the ‘007’ of the taste squad,

510
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,180
I have gotten the details

511
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,060
of Mu Chunfeng.

512
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,180
It also

513
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,900
has something to do with you.

514
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,900
The Lu Group sponsored him

515
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,540
to study in France.

516
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,780
It’s him!

517
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,980
Did you

518
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,780
argue again?

519
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,420
Will he do the physical training?

520
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,420
Do the best!

521
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,510
See you at 8 p.m. tonight. It’s important.

522
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,300
This news is very important.

523
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,699
It should be attractive.

524
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,540
Make an eye-catching title.

525
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,210
OK. I’ll change it right now.

526
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,739
OK.

527
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,700
How is the script for the competition?

528
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,860
It's almost done.

529
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,500
We mainly prepare the scripts

530
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,960
for the win of Mu Chunfeng.

531
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,780
You should also pay attention to Lu Weixun.

532
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,620
He won’t give up easily.

533
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,700
OK.

534
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,620
Don't waste time.

535
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,260
Go to work.

536
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,940
I feel that

537
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,180
Lu Weixun is kind of pathetic.

538
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,180
Zhuzhu.

539
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,620
Why?

540
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
You want him to win?

541
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,820
I don’t know why

542
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,420
but I think

543
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,660
Lu Weixun may turn the tide.

544
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,300
You know.

545
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,020
If Lu Weixun wins it,

546
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,420
will Mi Ya come back?

547
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,340
It’s possible!

548
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,620
I really expect it!

549
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,700
Why are you following me?

550
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,300
This is the last chance.

551
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,580
I must ensure it.

552
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,100
Who is it?

553
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,740
Hao Yong.

554
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,590
He found something important.

555
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,180
Let’s go.

556
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,420
Why do you come here

557
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,340
to return me the umbrella?

558
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,420
I used to stay here alone

559
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,420
when I was young.

560
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,480
Even my brother didn’t know here.

561
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,700
Your brother?

562
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,820
Are you twins?

563
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,460
Yes.

564
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:13,940
Where

565
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,180
is he now?

566
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,660
Dead.

567
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,100
Today is his death anniversary.

568
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,540
I’m sorry.

569
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,420
It’s OK.

570
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
Someone else should say sorry to me.

571
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,620
What do you mean?

572
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,820
My brother died because of a man.

573
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,740
The man

574
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,780
who caused his death is still alive.

575
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,340
He was so passionate,

576
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,500
while abandoned by others.

577
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,980
When we were young,

578
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,820
my dad was wronged,

579
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,340
and framed.

580
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,520
He was missing.

581
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,740
I have been

582
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,100
living with hatred these years.

583
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,830
I have no idea what a normal life

584
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,740
should be.

585
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,540
What kind of person is your brother?

586
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
He was gentle,

587
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,940
unlike me.

588
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,740
Maybe he doesn’t hope

589
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,340
you live with hatred.

590
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,020
It will be over soon.

591
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,940
Why did you tell me these things?

592
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,670
I don’t know.

593
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,060
Maybe I feel better to say it out loud.

594
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,140
I think you can be trusted.

595
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,960
Can I do something for you?

596
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,980
You listened to my nagging.

597
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,540
I feel happy about that.

598
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,980
Hao Yong.

599
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:51,780
Buzui.

600
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,820
Hello.

601
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,830
Waiter. My coffee, please!

602
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,180
No need.

603
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,260
Let’s get to the point.

604
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Don’t you have something important

605
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,900
to tell us?

606
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,320
Something important?

607
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,020
What is the important thing?

608
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,060
I’m asking you!

609
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:22,980
Yeah.

610
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,300
You’re asking me.

611
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,260
I mean the important thing

612
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,820
is that...

613
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,320
Mu Chunfeng...

614
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,260
Mu Chunfeng

615
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,640
is suspicious.

616
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,180
Nonsense!

617
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,980
Mu Chunfeng...

618
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,500
I’m going to the washroom.

619
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,380
Me too.

620
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,900
He Buzui.

621
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,340
Don’t run away.

622
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,100
If you escape,

623
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,940
you won’t get your salary.

624
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,110
Hao Yong.

625
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,200
Watch over her.

626
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,860
Yes.

627
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,820
What happened?

628
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,840
Take off your clothes.

629
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,860
Why?

630
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,480
You are my friend, aren’t you?

631
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,300
You must help me.

632
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,380
Hurry up.
