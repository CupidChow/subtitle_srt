1
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,620
One day ago.

2
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Have a taste of my DIY dishes!

3
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,770
They are as good as the dishes of Michelin!

4
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,750
Daughter!

5
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
You are really cured?

6
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,480
I didn’t believe it

7
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,880
in the beginning either.

8
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,320
I thought it was just my illusion.

9
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,440
But after days

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,120
eating like crazy,

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,890
I finally am sure

12
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,360
that I’m cured!

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
I regained my sense of taste!

14
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,900
That’s so amazing!

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,480
I spent all I had to treat your illness

16
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,400
but still couldn’t!

17
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,020
Can’t believe you are cured all of a sudden!

18
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,480
I think the heaven

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,520
is moved by my sincerity!

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,760
It felt sorry for

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,760
my daughter’s tasteless life

22
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,320
that was only fulfilled by hard work and making money.

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,600
Dad,

24
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,160
I think my good moral character finally paid off!

25
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,890
These years,

26
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,440
I’ve been doing good deeds,

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,600
working hard and punishing the bad people

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,760
by drinking….

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
What did you say?

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,000
I said…I said…

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,610
I said I’m finally able to enjoy the flavor of different drinks!

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
It’d happen sooner or later.

33
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,160
Come on, eat more!

34
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,960
What are you doing?

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,480
You took my stuff!

36
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,220
You must give it back to me!

37
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,020
Have you lost your mind?

38
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,060
How could you do that to me?

39
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,540
Are you simply a dog!

40
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,260
I’ve got to get the rabies vaccine!

41
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,500
You are so gross!

42
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,060
Don’t think so highly of yourself!

43
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,700
I’m not interested in a fierce, ugly, and unsexy girl

44
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,460
like you, okay?

45
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,740
You are just a bandit!

46
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,940
You are laughing?

47
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,740
You are crazy!

48
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,660
Why are you laughing?

49
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,460
Who gave you the right to eat with my sense of taste?

50
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,860
What your sense of taste?

51
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,820
Does it have your name on?

52
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,580
I can eat and drink

53
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,940
whatever I want!

54
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,020
It’s my freedom!

55
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,400
None of your business!

56
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,020
Fortunately, it’s back!

57
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,860
You think the sense of taste can be exchanged by kiss?

58
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,760
You are not in your right mind!

59
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,060
Don’t get addicted to my kiss!

60
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,260
Don’t even think about kissing me again!

61
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,980
You slap me?

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,580
You…

63
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,900
Now we can

64
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,580
call it even!

65
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,860
He brought me bad luck every time I saw him.

66
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,060
He is simply a bandit!

67
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,140
Bandit?

68
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,140
He took my sense of taste away!

69
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,200
Sense of taste?

70
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,310
How did he take it away from you?

71
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,860
You made it

72
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,660
seem like

73
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,020
he kissed you!

74
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,580
He really kissed you?

75
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,460
pervert

76
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,220
How could he do that?

77
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,820
Doesn’t he have any taste?

78
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,270
Lu Weixun, you bastard!

79
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,860
I was wrong about him!

80
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,720
I’ll go get him!

81
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,220
Don’t you get my point?

82
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,420
He kissed me,

83
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,700
but my sense of taste is gone!

84
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,060
Lu Weixun kissed you,

85
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,440
and then you lost your sense of taste.

86
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,380
It’s back again!

87
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,860
Mr. Lu,

88
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,940
congratulations for your successful performance.

89
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,070
But I couldn’t reach you by phone call.

90
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,300
Successful?

91
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,460
Why do you think it was successful?

92
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,380
You are a legend in the field of wine commentary.

93
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,310
No one can match.

94
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,900
Even though I wasn’t there in person,

95
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,160
I know it must have been a fantastic show!

96
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,580
Your tone sounds very official.

97
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,380
Your first article

98
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,260
got popular through our magazine.

99
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,720
You are like a family to us.

100
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,540
You are asking me to deliver the article?

101
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,060
I shouldn’t have disturbed you,

102
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,500
but the client is pushing us.

103
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,340
It’s out of our Chief Editor’s control.

104
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,980
Where?

105
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Muunas Winery.

106
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,860
Sorry.

107
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,580
I’m afraid

108
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,460
I need two more days.

109
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,790
Don’t worry.

110
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,300
You seldom delay.

111
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,740
I’m sure you are having some issues this time.

112
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,670
I’ll explain it to the chief editor

113
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,260
Thank you.

114
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,080
Look forward to your new work.

115
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,420
Shall I propose the challenge to him now?

116
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
If you win the next context,

117
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,380
the Rose Winery of the Lu Family will be yours.

118
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,310
What if he doesn’t respond?

119
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,260
Don’t worry,

120
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,020
I’ll make him.

121
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,580
May I ask why?

122
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,960
You are his father.

123
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,740
Why do you do this to your son?

124
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,340
The reason is simple.

125
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,460
Because I am his father.

126
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,860
Because he is the only successor of the Lu Group.

127
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,580
You shouldn’t be here.

128
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,420
You are late!

129
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,120
Have you finished your business?

130
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,900
Tell me!

131
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,960
That’s what my mom asked before she died!

132
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,980
Somebody stole your stuff?

133
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,380
Yes.

134
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,420
What did you lose?

135
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
My sense of taste!

136
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,060
Wallet!

137
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,510
Somebody stole from you or robbed you?

138
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,820
Stole from me.

139
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,260
Do you remember where?

140
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,340
On the parking lot of Dagang Hospital.

141
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Around noon.

142
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,220
Do you remember how the thief looked?

143
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,740
Yes.

144
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,540
I can recognize her

145
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,960
if you take me to check the surveillance .

146
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,340
He said this girl stole from him.

147
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,400
She stole your wallet?

148
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,420
Yes.

149
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,860
She did.

150
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,420
I’ve watched several times.

151
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,150
I didn’t see she steal from you.

152
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,200
Stop watching.

153
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,660
You’ve checked the video.

154
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,980
She didn’t steal anything from you.

155
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,620
But my wallet is lost.

156
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,560
And I only talked to her back then.

157
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,060
You’ll find out the truth

158
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,020
if you get her here.

159
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,300
Do you know her?

160
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,220
What’s your relationship?

161
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,150
I don’t know her.

162
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,140
She stole from me, and I’m the victim.

163
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,060
I’m telling you,

164
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,820
false alarm is the act of disturbing official business.

165
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,780
If the circumstances are serious,

166
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,900
you’ll be detained for 5-10 days.

167
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,340
And you’ll be fined too.

168
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,380
Think twice before you speak again.

169
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,240
Did she really steal your wallet?

170
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,780
She did.

171
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,900
He’s here! He’s here!

172
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,100
Excuse me! Excuse me!

173
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,540
Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu!

174
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,860
Don’t push! Don’t push! Don’t push!

175
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,340
Step back! Step back!

176
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,660
Don’t push!

177
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,510
Don’t push! Don’t push!

178
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,300
Step back!

179
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,500
Step back!

180
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,580
Finally, it’s time to get off work!

181
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,260
So happy!

182
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,140
Those people were crazy!

183
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,900
What’s wrong?

184
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,540
These reporters

185
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,960
might graduate from martial art school.

186
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,260
I thought I almost failed stopping them.

187
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,590
You might get sprained.

188
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,380
I have some medicine here.

189
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,060
Take it

190
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,340
and give it a try.

191
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
You are so reliable!

192
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,940
Of course!

193
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,700
Officer,

194
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,860
this is He Buzui.

195
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,580
He Buzui.

196
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,660
Someone accused you of stealing.

197
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,860
You need to come with us.

198
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,580
Stealing?

199
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,660
Me?

200
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,740
No way!

201
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,700
There must be a misunderstanding.

202
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,060
You can explain at the police station.

203
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,580
Do you have any evidence?

204
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,940
Right, do you?

205
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,540
Was that you?

206
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,940
I am innocent!

207
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,230
I’ll go with you.

208
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,510
Bring my purse back.

209
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,110
You are back.

210
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,340
Now, sit down.

211
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,830
I knew it must be you!

212
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,100
So,

213
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,950
what are you up to this time?

214
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,940
Stop yelling.

215
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
Write down your information first.

216
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,720
Did you steal from him?

217
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,580
Steal?

218
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,920
Why would I steal from him?

219
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
I would never do something like that

220
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
no matter what difficulties I have.

221
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,140
Does he refer to the sense of taste?

222
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Now you remember?

223
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,420
I didn’t steal it.

224
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,580
It came back itself!

225
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,300
Also,

226
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,820
how can you prove that it’s yours?

227
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,430
What are you talking about?

228
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,980
This is the police station,

229
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,980
not a place for you to fight and chat!

230
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,500
What was lost?

231
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,860
Explain now!

232
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
Officer,

233
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,300
here’s the thing.

234
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,900
I have his sense of taste.

235
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,220
Actually, it’s…it’s…

236
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,100
it’s my heart!

237
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,740
She stole

238
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,700
my heart!

239
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,460
Can’t believe you two!

240
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,080
Come to the police station to fight?!

241
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,300
Officer!

242
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
You misunderstood!

243
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,260
About what?

244
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,020
He Buzui and Lu Weixun, right?

245
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,180
You are even named as a couple!

246
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Still lying to me!

247
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,860
Do you know your

248
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,980
false alarm

249
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,620
has seriously disturbed the official business order

250
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,580
of the police station?

251
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,440
I have the right

252
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,580
to detain you for three days!

253
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,380
It’s all your fault!

254
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,780
Enough!

255
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,740
Stop it now!

256
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,400
Do you want to leave or not?

257
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,220
Two options for you.

258
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,660
One,

259
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,180
Three-day detention here.

260
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,620
Two,

261
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,580
fill in the form

262
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,660
and get out of here!

263
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,420
How can prove that I get my sense of taste

264
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,580
from you but not for

265
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,500
any other reasons?

266
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,340
Cheese hotpot, fried chicken, roasted chicken wings,

267
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,460
spicy sticks, potato chips and instant noodle.

268
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,400
You ate those things, didn’t you?

269
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,140
Why do you think I ate them?

270
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,380
Because I never eat those things!

271
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,580
Those are all junk food with preservatives and coloring!

272
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,220
That’s right!

273
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,540
I did eat those things!

274
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,420
But I put them in my mouth.

275
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,500
How would that affect you?

276
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,430
Because you are in my mind already!

277
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,099
So you are baring your heart?

278
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,579
I’m sorry!

279
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
I’ve already had somebody in my heart.

280
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,359
I’m not interested in you.

281
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,310
I only care about my sense of taste!

282
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,140
Let’s say it’s yours.

283
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,500
But it came to me itself,

284
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,740
what can I do?

285
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,120
I don’t know how but

286
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,460
our sense of taste got exchanged.

287
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,660
Speaking from the former experience,

288
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,580
I can get my sense of taste back

289
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,940
as long as my lips are in contact with yours.

290
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,380
I don’t know for now

291
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,340
how I can get it back for good.

292
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,380
So,

293
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
I’ll hire you for a while

294
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,740
to keep it for me.

295
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,680
Give it back to me temporarily

296
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,300
when I need it.

297
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,300
You are crazy!

298
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,540
Then tell me,

299
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,720
how much I need to pay for this cycle deal?

300
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,300
Cycle deal?

301
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,460
The term is quite professional.

302
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
You know what?

303
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,600
If you pay me this much,

304
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,380
I’ll work with you!

305
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,340
Okay!

306
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,780
It’s a deal!

307
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,880
I’ll draft the contract tonight,

308
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
and we’ll sign it tomorrow morning.

309
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,060
Okay!

310
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,620
Whoever bails is a coward!

311
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Get on there!

312
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,580
Stupid!

313
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,060
Get on!

314
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,780
Come on!

315
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,540
Surround, now!

316
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,660
Xiao Yongyong!

317
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,580
Thank god, you are back!

318
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,260
Do you know how much I worried about you?

319
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,180
You were taken away by the police today.

320
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,140
The bodyguard leader told me

321
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,920
that he can’t hire anybody who has a case record.

322
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,220
He was crazy to say something like that!

323
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,780
So,

324
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,940
I argued with him.

325
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,340
If he fired you,

326
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,340
I’d quit too!

327
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
I’ll stay

328
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,160
only if He Buzui stays!

329
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,300
Good for you, buddy!

330
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,500
Thank you!

331
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,340
But you should stick to this job.

332
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,740
To me, it’s an unprofitable tough job.

333
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,400
I wanted to quit long time ago.

334
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,260
An unprofitable tough job?

335
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,190
What do you mean?

336
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,900
I lost!

337
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,380
Stop playing.

338
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,310
What did he say about the bonus?

339
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,500
Bonus?

340
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,580
I’m afraid

341
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,740
it’s none.

342
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,660
But he said

343
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,380
that he’ll send the salary of this month

344
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,430
to your account.

345
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,280
That’s thoughtful of him.

346
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,500
It’s okay!

347
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,540
You have me!

348
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
I’ll support you!

349
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,360
With your poor salary?

350
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,880
How’s that gonna help?

351
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Then,

352
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,500
let’s sell our blood?

353
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,660
Sell blood?

354
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,140
Are you out of your mind?

355
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,580
Crazy!

356
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,670
We said the day after tomorrow.

357
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,380
I will pay you off by then.

358
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,060
Open the door!

359
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,540
It’s open.

360
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,510
What do you want?

361
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,460
What are you doing?

362
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,520
What are you doing?

363
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,060
Sign the contract!

364
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,980
How did you know I live here?

365
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,020
I saw your address last night

366
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,060
when you filled in the form at the police station.

367
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,820
I have photographic memory

368
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,840
Take a look.

369
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,340
I don’t have so much time.

370
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,700
Are you serious?

371
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,790
You live here alone?

372
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,460
My dad went shopping.

373
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,260
Take a look at the contract.

374
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,920
Sign it if you are okay with it.

375
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,340
First party Lu Weixun, second party He buzui.

376
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,180
The first party has the right to make adjustment

377
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,140
to the work contents and responsibilities of the second party at any time

378
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,540
according to the second party’s abilities and performance.

379
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,080
Why didn’t you just put

380
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,220
the first party has the right to enslave the second party?

381
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,940
I did.

382
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,380
On the third page.

383
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,540
The first party shall exercise

384
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,460
24-hour working system when necessary.

385
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,540
The second party shall be on call around the clock.

386
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,700
Are you aware of

387
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,140
one thing called labor law?

388
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,980
I am.

389
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,420
Payment for working overtime will be counted by the hour.

390
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,700
Double payment

391
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,310
for each extra hour.

392
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,380
Then, when can I get my payment?

393
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,340
You’ll be paid in the middle of every month.

394
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,400
6,000 Yuan a month.

395
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,420
6,000 Yuan a month?

396
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,980
Then I’ll be your slave

397
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,340
for 333 months, which is 28 years!

398
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,260
28 years!

399
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,700
Why does it take that long for me to get the money?

400
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,820
In 28 years, I’ll be 53 years old.

401
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,980
From the medical point of view,

402
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,020
after 53 years old,

403
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,460
the functions of the human body will rapidly decline.

404
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,820
Even if we can still exchange our sense of taste then,

405
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,140
it will reduce greatly with the decaying physical condition.

406
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,500
An average sense of taste

407
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,700
means nothing to me.

408
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,040
I won’t care to have it.

409
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,260
But before that,

410
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,260
I have to prepare for the worst!

411
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,700
If we can’t exchange our sense of taste for good,

412
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,100
I have to make sure that my life and my career

413
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,540
won’t be affected by it!

414
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,980
So my life will become a mess!

415
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,860
Miss He,

416
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,380
in my opinion,

417
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,180
I in fact will take bigger risk

418
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,860
hiring you for 28 years.

419
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,110
But before that,

420
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,780
as long as we can find a way to exchange our sense of taste for good,

421
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,980
we can terminate the contract any time.

422
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,760
And I won’t see you ever again!

423
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,150
You can get your money earlier too!

424
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,420
This money…

425
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,860
He Buzui.

426
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,640
Calm!

427
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,740
Be calm!

428
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,580
You’ve got to have a bottom line!

429
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,920
How could you give your dignity up for money?

430
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,620
But if I accept this job,

431
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,540
I can use it to offset the monthly loan.

432
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,500
All it takes me is a kiss.

433
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,500
I’ll just consider it a dog bite.

434
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,140
Of course,

435
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,300
it’s not a small amount of money.

436
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,740
If you don’t want to,

437
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,380
I won’t force you…

438
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,230
You’ve thought it through?

439
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,620
No!

440
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,260
No way!

441
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
Bro De!

442
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,060
What brought you here?

443
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,220
Don’t call me that!

444
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,700
I’m not your brother!

445
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,540
You are my grandma, okay?

446
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,340
The ones who owe money nowadays

447
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,220
are with the real power.

448
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,080
You even shut down your phone.

449
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,780
So I’m here to greet you in person!

450
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,580
Bro De!

451
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,860
I’m greeting to you!

452
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
Come on!

453
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,460
Please take a seat!

454
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,840
Let me clean it for you.

455
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:47,940
Please!

456
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,580
Take a rest!

457
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,140
Let me get you some tea!

458
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,860
Okay.

459
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Hey, turn around!

460
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,060
Turn around!

461
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,340
Miss He,

462
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,140
you’ll get rich now!

463
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,620
You’ve signed a contract that’ll pay you a large amount of money!

464
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
So, about the small money you owe us,

465
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,900
don’t you think…

466
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,420
I understand.

467
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,940
Bro De, let’s talk!

468
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,220
So you won’t pay us, huh?

469
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,510
Bro De, are you okay?

470
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,940
Don’t just stand there!

471
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,000
Destroy this place! Don’t look at me!

472
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,500
Please! Don’t!

473
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,580
Don’t!

474
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,540
Stop!

475
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,820
What you think you are doing?

476
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,260
Hey!

477
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,620
What’s your problem?

478
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,860
Young man,

479
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,480
don’t you know the rule

480
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,700
that debt should be paid?

481
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,860
It’s none of your business!

482
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,720
Get out of here!

483
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,700
Go on!

484
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,500
How much does she owe you?

485
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,910
What do you mean?

486
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,980
Sounds like

487
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,460
you want to pay it for her?

488
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,900
How much?

489
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,540
It’s a lot of money with interest!

490
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,760
I’ll pay it for her.

491
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,710
You want to play a hero to save beauty?!

492
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,580
Fight and threat won’t solve any problems.

493
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,150
Let’s be practical.

494
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Let’s sign a three-party contract.

495
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,780
Why would I use violence

496
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,460
if I can get paid?

497
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,420
Let me be clear.

498
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,500
You have to pay every penny!

499
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,660
This is the number showed on the IOU.

500
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,510
You’ll break the law

501
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,380
if you ask more than that.

502
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,590
What do you mean?

503
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,620
This is the total amount I’ll pay back.

504
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,980
It’ll be paid quarterly,

505
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,180
and paid off in a year.

506
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,140
Are you bargaining with me?

507
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,700
Bargaining?

508
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,620
She can’t afford a lawyer, but I can.

509
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,260
Don’t be too greedy!

510
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,400
It won’t be good to you!

511
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,180
Plus,

512
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,700
you go to her home every month to ask for the money,

513
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,700
even if you destroy her home over and over again,

514
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,020
she still won’t be able to pay you off

515
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,380
in a year.

516
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,660
Alright!

517
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,860
Buddy,

518
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,620
you are very straightforward.

519
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,080
Let’s go with your number!

520
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,500
But,

521
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,100
I have one condition.

522
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,300
What?

523
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,460
I’ll only pay you quarterly

524
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,350
if she agrees to work for me!

525
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,780
I passed by a planet named after you.

526
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,030
Where are you taking me?

527
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,940
Muunas Winery.

528
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,500
Your eyes are clear and shining.

529
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,860
When can you understand my heart?

530
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,180
The day and night on the planet is upside down.

531
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,220
It’s sign for the explosion of love!

532
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,860
Run along the trajectory of the universe.

533
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,940
I can find you in my dreams.

534
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,340
Mr. Lu.

535
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,060
Mr. Ma.

536
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,070
Long time no see!

537
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,390
Long time no see!

538
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,060
Who’s this lady?

539
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,420
My assistant.

540
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,820
Mr. Ma, nice to meet you.

541
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,880
My name is He Buzui.

542
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,060
He Buzui?

543
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,900
Never get drunk!

544
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Good name!

545
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,140
Cause I can never get drunk!

546
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,980
Have some self-respect!

547
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,340
We all live on liquor!

548
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,830
Who do you think you are to judge me?

549
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,780
Do you want to take a rest or…

550
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,940
We’ll go to the wine cellar now.

551
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,420
Okay.

552
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,660
This way, please.

553
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:55,780
Here.

554
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,100
It’s so cold in here!

555
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,030
You are not here for a vacation!

556
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,620
This is the temperature most suitable for storing the wine.

557
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,420
Follow us.

558
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,540
Please.

559
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,340
Watch the steps.

560
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,420
This is the product No. 92.

561
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,820
There are 18 barrels.

562
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,660
I’ve prepared one glass of sample for each,

563
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,720
for you to examine.

564
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

565
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,900
We’ll take care of the rest.

566
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,580
Okay.

567
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,740
I’ll leave now.

568
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,260
Come over.

569
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Why?

570
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,100
Exchange the sense of taste.

571
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,820
Now?

572
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,660
Here?

573
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,900
Of course!

574
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,700
It’s working time.

575
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,060
Please be professional.

576
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,380
Wait!

577
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,300
I regret now!

578
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,660
I want to break the contract!

579
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,100
Didn’t you read the note

580
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,220
on last page of the contract?

581
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,940
What note?

582
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,140
If you break the contract, you’ll need to pay double penalty!

583
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,140
What?

584
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,180
You…

585
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,980
The fragrance from

586
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,900
blackberry and raspberry.

587
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,800
Together with the fresh smell of meadow.

588
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,260
Aftertaste

589
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,310
is the slight bitter of chocolate and coffee.

590
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,660
Wait.

591
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,020
This is…

592
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,060
What is he doing?

593
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,580
One glass after another.

594
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,980
When will he finish?

595
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,190
It’s ruined!

596
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,180
All ruined!

597
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,380
Mr. Lu.

598
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,180
How is it?

599
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,780
Empty the barrels of

600
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,220
product No. 92.

601
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,620
All of them?

602
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,820
Yes. All Brett.

603
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,580
Well,

604
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,860
if it’s all Brett…

605
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,220
Well…

606
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,460
Where did you get the barrels?

607
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,380
I thought you said…

608
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,310
The winemaker said that he wanted some used oak barrels,

609
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,660
in order to reduce the effect of the barrel on the wine.

610
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,220
So, these barrels were bought from Gaoling Winery.

611
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,420
What about cleaning?

612
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,860
They were cleaned once before delivered here.

613
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,140
The pomace

614
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,140
in the barrels No. 92 and 93

615
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,900
had slight acetic smell,

616
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,820
so we just left it there

617
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,630
and used the barrels directly.

618
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,420
Empty the barrels.

619
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,100
Then take them to the outside,

620
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,180
and sterilize them with high concentration alcohol.

621
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
Get it done today.

622
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:23,980
Okay.

623
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,260
It’s such a waste to throw them all!

624
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,380
Mr. Ma.

625
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,140
What is that Bre…

626
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,660
What were you talking about?

627
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,500
It’s Brett.

628
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,060
It smells a little bit like animal.

629
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,060
You can imagine the smell of stable.

630
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,260
Small amount of Brett

631
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,500
can improve the texture and flavor of the wine.

632
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
But too much Brett

633
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,780
will be considered unqualified.

634
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,380
Does a sommelier really has that kinda power

635
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,140
to get rid of a whole barrel of wine?

636
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,660
Other sommeliers may not,

637
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,590
but Mr. Lu has the power.

638
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,980
So you are really going to dump all the wine?

639
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,340
The wine is all turned.

640
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,980
It’s not wine!

641
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,620
But dumping it all is too far.

642
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,580
Even though it doesn’t taste good,

643
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,640
it’s not poisonous after all.

644
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,220
It takes a lot of manpower, material and financial resources

645
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,260
to make wine.

646
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,780
It’ll be a big waste to dump it all.

647
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,380
Wine is a gift of nature.

648
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,940
The flavor of the wine can be simple,

649
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,400
but cannot be unpleasant.

650
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,750
If we sell the unqualified wine

651
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,670
just for saving some money,

652
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,540
it’ll be a disrespect to the work of

653
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,940
sunshine, climate and yeast.

654
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,340
Getting rid of the unqualified

655
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,140
is a respect to the qualified.

656
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,620
Although this Lu Weixun is quite annoying,

657
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,580
he’s kind of attractive when he’s at work!

658
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,310
Mom, what are you drinking?

659
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,750
This is something makes you feel pleasant

660
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,140
and sad at the same time.

661
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,500
Magic water?

662
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,580
Yes, magic water!

663
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,340
I hope you can introduce our magic water

664
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,500
to the world when you grow up.

665
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,700
I can do that!

666
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,940
I believe you can!

667
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,860
Xun.

668
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,780
Where’s your father?

669
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,580
He’ll be here soon!

670
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,220
Don’t fall asleep! Please wait for him!

671
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,820
Xun.

672
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,340
You are a talented kid!

673
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,630
Do what you want to do

674
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,220
in the future.

675
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,500
I’m sorry

676
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,540
that I can’t

677
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,820
be with you anymore.

678
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,420
Mom!

679
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,620
Mom!

680
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,260
Mom! Wake up!

681
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,340
Mom!

682
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,700
Mom! Wake up!

683
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,980
Mom!

684
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,980
Mom!
