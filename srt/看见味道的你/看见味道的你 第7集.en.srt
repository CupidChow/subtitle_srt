1
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,170
Mom has been gone for ten years.

2
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
You still can't get over losing her?

3
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,040
What are you here for, again?

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,400
To stop you.

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,520
Stop you from the danger of

6
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,400
betting all on a single throw.

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,470
I have to win back Rose Winery.

8
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,440
Can you afford the price

9
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,560
you might have to pay?

10
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,960
Can you really give up the money,

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,840
honor,

12
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,720
and status

13
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
you already have.

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,900
If I can accept the challenge,

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,360
I can accept the results.

16
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,560
Money,

17
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,760
honor,

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,920
or status,

19
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,760
is never what I want.

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,360
What do you want?

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
I’m going to take back

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,440
what I want.

23
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,280
Have you made up your mind?

24
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,400
Don't think you can keep hidden

25
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,240
what you did.

26
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Don’t expect to get near the winery.

27
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,640
I’ll get the Rose Winery back.

28
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,640
You have no right to interfere.

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,570
what did you say?

30
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,079
I have no right?

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,240
Do you have to waste your time

32
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
on it?

33
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,320
It’s ok if you want it.

34
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,640
You can

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,200
either inherit it

36
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,440
or

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,890
fight for it with your own ability.

38
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,080
Ok.

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,460
I’ll fight for it with my own ability.

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
The winery has been losing money for years.

41
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,900
I'll get rid of it as soon as possible.

42
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,019
I'm not going to let you sell my mother's winery.

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,440
Beidao,

44
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,960
I’m off if there’s nothing more for me to do.

45
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Hello?

46
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
senior.

47
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,720
It’s been long since I saw you.

48
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,850
Give me a chance to treat you to dinner.

49
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,520
senior,

50
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,040
are you asking me out?

51
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,680
Recently I have been busy,

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
But I’m free now.

53
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
See you tomorrow.

54
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,440
Ok.

55
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,680
Where?

56
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,960
I haven’t been back to our school for a long time.

57
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,220
I’d like to have a look.

58
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,520
It happens that I want that too.

59
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,600
See you at school tomorrow.

60
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,800
Ok.

61
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
See you tomorrow.

62
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,260
Lu Weixun,

63
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,800
something urgent happened.

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
I need to ask for a one-day leave.

65
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,340
After all these years,

66
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
the school hasn't changed at all.

67
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,260
Yeah.

68
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,200
It seems that time has stopped.

69
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,620
I don't want time to stop here.

70
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,560
I mean…

71
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,760
over there

72
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,440
there was a silly girl

73
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,080
wet all through.

74
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,420
That is the place where we met for the first time.

75
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,290
What about here?

76
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,080
This is

77
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,940
the place where we took a photo together for the first time.

78
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Come here.

79
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,760
Here.

80
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,170
Seat No.4, Row 5.

81
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,370
Seat No.5, Row 5.

82
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,080
This is simple.

83
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,540
You want to have some dark plums.

84
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
I happen to have some.

85
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
And there’s this bottle.

86
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,850
I use it myself all the time.

87
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
It’s nothing valuable,

88
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,440
but I’ll give it to you.

89
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,600
If you want to have dark plums,

90
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,880
you can put them here.

91
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,820
Then you write something difficult.

92
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,640
What’s that?

93
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,200
Sorry.

94
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,440
Sorry.

95
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,120
What’s wrong?

96
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
What’s it?

97
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,080
Literature Girl.

98
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,560
What?

99
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,300
What do you think it is?

100
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
You want to see me?

101
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,400
Let’s have another competition.

102
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,520
What a surprising proposal.

103
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,280
But your proposal

104
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,120
would do me no good.

105
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,720
I beat you.

106
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,080
It's a fact.

107
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
I really don't need to risk it

108
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,640
against you again.

109
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,960
Besides, I get both

110
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,050
the winery and the reputation.

111
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,360
Of course,

112
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,040
this is thanks to your previous fame

113
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,920
and failure this time.

114
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,100
Human desire is infinite.

115
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Now that you've got the Rose Winery,

116
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,200
don't you want the Muunas Winery?

117
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,930
How about

118
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,320
we have another competition?

119
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,080
If I lose,

120
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,190
the Muunas Winery is yours.

121
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,400
If I win,

122
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,040
the Rose Winery is mine.

123
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,660
It’s here.

124
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
What?

125
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,520
Want to escape?

126
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,370
Where are you going?

127
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,920
Where are you going?

128
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
Somebody! Help…

129
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,360
Help what?

130
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,540
Shout again.

131
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,400
-Go ahead!  -Why stop?

132
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,410
Do you think we are beggars?

133
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,040
Run.

134
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,720
Once

135
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,920
I was told unrequited love was sad.

136
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,360
After being there,

137
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,680
I know our love is like a mistake.

138
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,600
In other people's stories the main characters have changed.

139
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,680
Who is not there to face their own rise and fall?

140
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,280
Everyone has a demon in heart.

141
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,320
Don’t shout out your commitment.

142
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,840
The place where you saved me for the first time.

143
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,840
You got beaten.

144
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,820
Thank god I pulled you and ran.

145
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,570
The scar is still there.

146
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
I came to save you.

147
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,120
But it turned out you were on the track team

148
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,380
and ran faster than me.

149
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,720
I wish I had run earlier,

150
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,940
so you wouldn’t have got injured.

151
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,600
I have no regrets about it.

152
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,400
So, the person who bought the Muunas Winery anonymously

153
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,120
is you.

154
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
Mu Chunfeng.

155
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,420
If you work as a sommelier while operating a winery,

156
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,520
Mr. Lu,

157
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,810
how can you ensure the objectivity and fairness?

158
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,370
After the competition, whether I win or lose,

159
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,250
I will announce my retirement from the sommeliers’ circle.

160
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
This is my sincerity.

161
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,300
Honors from the competition,

162
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,640
status as a sommelier,

163
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,800
and the ownership of the winery.

164
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,760
Now that you have decided

165
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,300
to gamble your whole life,

166
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
there is no reason

167
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,240
for me to refuse.

168
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,280
Mu Chunfeng,

169
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,480
you cunning scum.

170
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,310
You are?

171
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,069
A little fan of Lu Weixun.

172
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,000
I am a big fan.

173
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,690
I’m telling you

174
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,069
the other day you won the competition by a fluke.

175
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,560
You were in luck.

176
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
You’d better stop at the right time.

177
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,920
Don’t plot against

178
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,109
and smear my idol.

179
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,640
God is watching what you are doing.

180
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,310
Even if our idol is as kind as a bodhisattva,

181
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,510
as his fans, we are not easy to mess with.

182
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,540
I advise you not to be so arrogant.

183
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,920
You are mad.

184
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,440
You are the one who is mad.

185
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,680
Thanks.

186
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,170
It's been a long time since I ate the popsicle at the school gate.

187
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
How time flies.

188
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,640
Did you have a good day today?

189
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,320
Yes.

190
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,560
Me, too.

191
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,260
This is for you.

192
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
Joker?

193
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,680
Did you not like

194
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,040
negative characters?

195
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,240
People change.

196
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
You don’t like it?

197
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,200
I like it.

198
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,680
Lu Weixun,

199
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,480
I like that dazzling you.

200
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,520
But I like you

201
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,200
now as well.

202
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,920
As your most loyal fan,

203
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,360
how can I follow you when you succeed

204
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,080
but leave you when you lose?

205
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,980
What are you doing?

206
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,160
Let go of me.

207
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,360
No.

208
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,440
Take someone else for your idol.

209
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,040
Why?

210
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,210
I’ll no longer be a sommelier soon.

211
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,520
Idol.

212
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,440
Idol.

213
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
We fans want nothing but the best for you.

214
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,720
Listen to us, will you?

215
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,920
Mr. Lu,

216
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,440
isn’t your assistant He Buzui with you?

217
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,880
Idol.

218
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,760
Think about what I told you.

219
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Mu Chunfeng’s scheme is so carefully planned.

220
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,330
There must be a purpose.

221
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,400
In the future, you must pay attention to your safety

222
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,000
in dangerous public places.

223
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,760
Otherwise, we’d be worried.

224
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,960
What danger?

225
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,210
Does that have anything to do with you?

226
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,760
What?

227
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
Tell me what danger it is.

228
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,020
It’s getting cold.

229
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,220
Do not expose your legs to the coldness.

230
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,480
Keep them warm.

231
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,600
And your neck.

232
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,960
Take good care of yourself.

233
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

234
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Did we agree on that?

235
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,960
Stop.

236
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Boss, I hope you are fine.

237
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,400
I’m not fine

238
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,830
and I feel worse when I meet you.

239
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,410
Go back home with me.

240
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,340
Who’s that?

241
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,680
Beidao,

242
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
the owner of a web celebrity bar.

243
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Boss?

244
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,720
Idol.

245
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,200
Remember what I told you.

246
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,840
Beidao,

247
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,100
then I'll go. See you later.

248
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:17,960
See you.

249
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,160
Buzui!

250
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,760
Yong,

251
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,700
I’m going back.

252
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,160
Let’s talk another time.

253
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,880
Beidao.

254
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,920
So, you are the dark plum guy?

255
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,010
You are back?

256
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,320
I am back.

257
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,160
Will you ever leave?

258
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,360
Not until I get my business done.

259
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,560
Beidao, can I have a taste of your dark plumb wine?

260
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,090
Let’s go.

261
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,160
Finish your business quickly and get out here quickly.

262
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,100
Please.

263
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,800
Have you memorized

264
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
all the seven segments of the taste?

265
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,360
You dared to ask for leave

266
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,920
with so much to do?

267
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,200
I'll deduct your salary.

268
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Why?

269
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,560
I didn’t get back late.

270
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,840
You were right on time.

271
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,170
But you broke some other rules.

272
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,360
Which one?

273
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
I was absent for one day.

274
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,330
Which rules did I break?

275
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,870
It’s ok if you want to go out,

276
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,120
but it depends on whom you hang out with.

277
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,280
It’s not ok if you hang out with him.

278
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,600
He is my senior at school.

279
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,460
Why isn’t it ok?

280
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,840
Because I said so.

281
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,860
What does that have to do with you?

282
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,040
What if he went after my sense of taste

283
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,640
and tried to take them away?

284
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,000
You mean he wants to kiss…?

285
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,760
He's not like you.

286
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,100
He’ll never do things like that.

287
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,640
It will be over soon.

288
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,720
When I'm done competing with Mu Chunfeng,

289
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,980
I'll announce my retirement from the sommeliers’ circle.

290
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,100
And that's when

291
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,600
our contract ends.

292
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,480
You’ll no longer be a sommelier?

293
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,800
Mu Chunfeng has accepted my challenge.

294
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,360
Compete with Mu Chunfeng,

295
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,360
defeat him,

296
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,340
and take back the Rose Winery.

297
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,240
That’s a good thing.

298
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,280
But when I take back the Rose Winery,

299
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,040
I will lose my status as a sommelier.

300
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,560
Why?

301
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,480
You need to break some eggs to make an omelet.

302
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,210
If I maintain both identities,

303
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,820
it is difficult to be objective and fair.

304
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,760
I see.

305
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,980
The Rose Winery was left by my mother.

306
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,820
day before yesterday,

307
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,480
it was transferred to Mu Chunfeng by Lu Linong.

308
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,080
Before that,

309
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,320
he had auctioned the Muunas Winery at a high price.

310
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,040
At that time,

311
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,560
I bought it anonymously

312
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,100
with my first pot of gold.

313
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,480
Muunas Winery?

314
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,340
Does a sommelier have that much power?

315
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,960
You have to throw it away if he says so?

316
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,220
Other sommeliers may not have the power,

317
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,880
but Mr. Lu does.

318
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,960
That explains it.

319
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,680
Are you really ready to give up

320
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,040
your status as the sommelier?

321
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,500
I’d give up everything

322
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,800
to defeat Mu Chunfeng.

323
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,800
You’d better think it over

324
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,180
whether you win or not.

325
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,320
This time

326
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I’m bound to win.

327
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
What are you doing?

328
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,880
Come here.

329
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,440
Sit down.

330
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,660
Tell me what’s in these five glasses.

331
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Wear a blindfold.

332
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,490
Sweet water.

333
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,690
White sugar and rock sugar.

334
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,840
Vinegar and salt.

335
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,440
Smell it not lick it.

336
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,100
Rose salt.

337
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,640
Brown sugar and a little lemon.

338
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,920
Fennel.

339
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,930
Angelica dahurica.

340
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,400
This is the pigment.

341
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,200
This is cinnamon.

342
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
Chrysanthemum tea.

343
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,800
Geranyl.

344
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,340
Dry leaves.

345
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,210
Are you sure?

346
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,280
Yes.

347
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,760
The last one.

348
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,320
This is sweet potato root.

349
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,480
Yes.

350
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,980
That’s all.

351
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,890
How was my performance?

352
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,240
Fairly good.

353
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,700
Full score.

354
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,240
What?

355
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,640
Am I a genius?

356
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,160
Boss,

357
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,640
did I surprise you?

358
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,860
Maybe you should award me something.

359
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,330
Don't get carried away.

360
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,560
Dismiss the idea of asking for leave as soon as possible.

361
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,760
The real exam is still to come.

362
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,880
Re…real exam?

363
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,200
What real exam?

364
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,200
These are just the basics.

365
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,840
It’s time to taste the red wine.

366
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,530
Starting tomorrow,

367
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,760
there’ll be tests.

368
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,400
Coming.

369
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,800
Xia Fan,

370
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,920
why are you here?

371
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
My idol called me.

372
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
I was of course on call.

373
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,100
Today,

374
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,400
you supervise her

375
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,930
and watch my previous competitions with her.

376
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
Watch competitions?

377
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
It turns out that my idol still trusts me.

378
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,240
Please rest assured.

379
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,000
With me here,

380
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,760
she will not be allowed to take her eyes off the TV,

381
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
let alone get out.

382
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,920
You have to figure out training methods later.

383
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,640
Yes, sir.

384
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,100
I need to go out.

385
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,280
Why?

386
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,560
Hire new employees.

387
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,680
Supervise her properly.

388
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,480
Come.

389
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,760
Have a try.

390
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
We’ll start with something simple.

391
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,320
What’s this?

392
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,280
You can’t even tell this one.

393
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,040
This is fragrant. Have a try.

394
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,160
What’s this?

395
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,000
Why? You know nothing.

396
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,640
Taste this.

397
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,640
What’s this?

398
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,940
Why did he let you taste these things?

399
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,040
To test my sense of taste.

400
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,810
Welcome. This way, please.

401
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,520
I heard that the wine in this newly opened web celebrity bar

402
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,800
is very good.

403
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
And Chao will stand treat today.

404
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,160
Make yourself at home.

405
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,120
We surely will.

406
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,960
Please be frugal!

407
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,840
How is this place?

408
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,120
I think it’s quite nice.

409
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
Feels good,

410
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,920
right?

411
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,800
Chao, you have a good taste.

412
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,160
Exactly. You know me.

413
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,480
This place doesn't suit you.

414
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,160
Do you dislike the environment

415
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,040
or the people?

416
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,840
I can offer you a job

417
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,040
as my taste trainer.

418
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,810
The salary is great.

419
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,420
You can get paid daily.

420
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,860
Do I look like someone short of money?

421
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,200
And?

422
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,240
The job I'm offering is well paid.

423
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
You should have no reason to refuse.

424
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,160
You know I do not work for money blindly.

425
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,160
What I value is your ability.

426
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,800
Why do you do taste training?

427
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,770
I’ll have another competition with Mu Chunfeng.

428
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,850
It’s simple.

429
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,330
Let's think about the process.

430
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,930
In tasting 45 glasses of non-blended drinks,

431
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
you're far faster than Mu Chunfeng.

432
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,610
You spent 270 seconds less than he did.

433
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,120
This means

434
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,400
as long as you give up the tasting of the blended wine,

435
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,320
you will win.

436
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,480
Winning is only an inevitable result.

437
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,360
What I want

438
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,440
is a perfect victory.

439
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,620
You want to defeat him so much?

440
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,160
I have to.

441
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,560
Ok.

442
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,570
But I don’t want to help.

443
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,200
Mr. Lu,

444
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,800
you are harassing my guest.

445
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,800
Your guest?

446
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,120
My guest.

447
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,760
I propose

448
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,200
we drink to the departure of Lu Weixun.

449
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,800
Seconded.

450
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,440
Let’s drink to the smooth progress of our work.

451
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,280
Chao.

452
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,640
For the exclusive interview this month,

453
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
you talked with Mu Chunfeng.

454
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,240
What is he like?

455
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,720
If we sign a contract with Mr. Mu,

456
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,250
please let me be his editor.

457
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,840
No. Let go of him.

458
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,680
Let me be his editor.

459
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,960
Why didn’t you two

460
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,200
get excited

461
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,920
when Lu Weixun cooperated with us?

462
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,560
He has such a nasty temper.

463
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,520
Someone else may put up with him,

464
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,360
but I won’t.

465
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:50,840
True.

466
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,920
It seems that

467
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Lu’s failure

468
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,760
is a punishment for what he has done.

469
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,600
Karma is a bitch.

470
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,880
A just cause enjoys abundant support

471
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,600
while an unjust cause finds little.

472
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,040
I’m not the one who hits a person when he is down.

473
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,500
But I want to be left alone.

474
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,920
How did Lu Weixun trust you so much?

475
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,280
Didn't he kick you out last time?

476
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,600
Who am I?

477
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,460
It's so easy to get someone to like me.

478
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,320
Maybe it's charisma.

479
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,710
-He is going to retire from the sommeliers’ circle?  -I know.

480
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,280
Mu Chunfeng is a scum.

481
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,120
We see eye to eye on this matter.

482
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,670
Idol.

483
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,940
Is your recruitment successful?

484
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,630
Is Yi Beidao on familiar terms with Mi Ya?

485
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,440
Familiar?

486
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,150
Am I that annoying?

487
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,080
Idol.

488
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,560
Why do you say that?

489
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,150
Do you hear anything negative about you?

490
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,150
I'll get even with them.

491
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,760
Forget it.

492
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,530
It’s not important.

493
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,630
Come here.

494
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,240
Let’s get down to business.

495
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,080
Idol,

496
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,120
know yourself and your enemy, you’ll never lose a battle.

497
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,760
I examined it thoroughly.

498
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
Mu Chunfeng is from Jiangsu.

499
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,040
He is sort of from a family of scholars.

500
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,480
His parents are academics

501
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,880
in France.

502
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,320
He studied in China

503
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,640
before middle school

504
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,340
and then went to France with his parents.

505
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
After he went abroad,

506
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,120
for some reason,

507
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,160
he did not become a scholar

508
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,600
like his parents,

509
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,220
but began to take an interest in wine.

510
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,000
And the strangest thing is that

511
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,120
he has never joined any wine society,

512
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,120
nor does his education background show that

513
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,840
he studied wine.

514
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,880
I want to find out whom he learned from,

515
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,140
but I can't find it out.

516
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,440
According to video,

517
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,320
we find that his speed of tasting

518
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,040
is surprisingly even.

519
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,080
Your speed of tasting

520
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,520
and the duration vary

521
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
with the complexity of the wine.

522
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,720
But it took him

523
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,600
40 seconds

524
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,500
from the first drink to the last.

525
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,680
In other words, unlike you, who relied on talent,

526
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,800
he relied on method.

527
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,160
And it takes 40 seconds.

528
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,600
According to the rules of the competition,

529
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,960
after one contestant finishes tasting 50 glasses of wine,

530
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,090
the other contestant will have to stop

531
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,680
and the scores will be calculated.

532
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,440
So, idol,

533
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,160
even if you fail

534
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,700
in tasting the last five glasses of blended wine,

535
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,440
as long as you are quick enough,

536
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,840
you can stop the competition

537
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,530
after you get 45 points.

538
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,560
But at his pace,

539
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,400
even if he got all the answers right,

540
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,000
he would have scored only 43 points.

541
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,600
So, idol,

542
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,030
if you follow my advice,

543
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,640
we’ll win for sure.

544
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,120
I will not do that.

545
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,700
Why?

546
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,280
Because I won’t fail in the appreciation

547
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,400
of a single glass of wine.

548
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,500
Do you want to defeat Mu Chunfeng completely

549
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,500
and let him experience the fear of being dominated?

550
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,480
Then how are you going to win out?

551
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,440
My ability.

552
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,640
These junk foods really affect my sense of taste.

553
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,320
I will never

554
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,740
want them again in the future.

555
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,080
What’s this?

556
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,400
A quiz.

557
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,600
A quiz?

558
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,960
Let’s begin.

559
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,120
Wineries,

560
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,530
places of origin

561
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,180
and their climate.

562
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,480
You didn’t write any of them down.

563
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,000
Do I need to write them too?

564
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,280
You didn’t teach me before.

565
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,920
Starting today

566
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
and within one month,

567
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,400
you have to memorize the flavors of all of them

568
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,960
and the taste information

569
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,840
behind each of them.

570
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,160
All of them?

571
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,040
Can’t do it?

572
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,200
I can.

573
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,180
One month is ok.

574
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,960
I may spend less time than that.

575
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,620
You’ll be drunk if you drink too much.

576
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,000
One month

577
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,170
is already the limit for ordinary people.

578
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,220
That’s for ordinary people.

579
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,320
I never get drunk.

580
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,980
Leaves.

581
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,780
Smells like some kind of flowers.

582
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,200
Wrong answer.

583
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,880
Pinot noir.

584
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,880
What is Pinot noir?
