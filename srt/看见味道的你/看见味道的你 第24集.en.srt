1
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,860
Memories flash back

2
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,340
Can’t forget you

3
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,539
It’s easy to miss you

4
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,979
It’s hard to forget

5
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,020
I give the palate back to you.

6
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,980
The room is empty

7
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,100
I call out in the emptiness

8
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,700
Our contract

9
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,020
ends now.

10
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,140
Got my birthday wrong but not with my habits

11
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,740
I die inside, yet you’re still haunting

12
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,620
I’ve convinced myself but you’re still peaking

13
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,740
Silly girl.

14
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,910
I’ve consulted the doctor.

15
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,500
My hysterical ageusia is cured.

16
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,820
You cured me.

17
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,940
Can I return the love you gave me

18
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,700
Mr. Wan.

19
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,940
Zhong told me you have a poor appetite recently.

20
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,880
You like apple since you were little.

21
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,480
Let me peel one for you.

22
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,260
Here.

23
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,140
Zeze,

24
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,740
can we have

25
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,300
a friendly conversation?

26
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,780
Yes.

27
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,980
I know Yang tried to

28
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,480
cut cost on certain things

29
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,550
But I didn’t know he’d adulterate liquor.

30
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,340
And I never thought

31
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,300
he would commit suicide.

32
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,460
Yang and I were partners for years.

33
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,100
His wife blamed me

34
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,180
for his death.

35
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,820
OK, I can understand her.

36
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,500
What do you want to do to He Buzui and the others?

37
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,860
Hey, I…

38
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,220
What could I do?

39
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,540
Why did you ask Zhong to follow He Buzui?

40
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,940
You told me

41
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,870
that they’re your friends.

42
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,580
I just want to know more about them.

43
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,940
By following them?

44
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,540
Zeze,

45
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,640
you spent most of your time

46
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
in the resort due to poor health.

47
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,660
You’ve been a pure and kind boy since little.

48
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,180
I’m afraid you’ll get hurt.

49
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,940
Dad,

50
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,110
don’t do things like that anymore.

51
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,500
OK. Not anymore.

52
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:43,060
You swear that you won’t hurt anybody else.

53
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,780
I swear.

54
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,540
The apple?

55
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,180
I don’t want my dad to be a bad man.

56
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,020
Of course I’m not.

57
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,580
I really admire you now.

58
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,980
What do you mean?

59
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,310
I thought love would blind you.

60
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,640
Turns out you stay clear-minded.

61
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,260
Actually, I gave the palate back to him

62
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,060
not because I don’t love him.

63
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,460
I just don’t know why he kept it from me.

64
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,340
I know that

65
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,900
I can’t blame him for the hatred of our fathers.

66
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,540
I did that just now, because…

67
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,540
You’re right.

68
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,470
That’s what I think now.

69
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,840
Maybe this is another way to stay clear-minded.

70
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,740
I blame myself for not be able to recall more.

71
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,940
How did you recall last time?

72
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,280
I think darkness and drowning

73
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,100
can jog my memory.

74
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,380
I know it’s selfish.

75
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,880
But can you try the same method again?

76
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,720
Just try your best.

77
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,620
We have so many bottles in Buck Winery.

78
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,300
Yes.

79
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,420
We bought a lot.

80
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,740
It’s been a long time.

81
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,200
I think they’re all there.

82
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,220
Why?

83
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,860
Why are there so many?

84
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,940
Why did you acquire He Wine Distillery?

85
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,540
Because your mom

86
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,860
liked their Pear Blossom very much.

87
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,100
My mom?

88
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,179
- Thank you for coming.  - All right.

89
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,700
If you like it, please let more people know.

90
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Excuse me? Have a look at our flyers.

91
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,530
Have a sip.

92
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,100
OK.

93
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,299
- That’s delicate.  - Ladies.

94
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,130
Always striving for the best.

95
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,890
Here’s an introduction

96
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,340
- to help you learn more.  - I agree.

97
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,740
I can help you.

98
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,940
Please.

99
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,900
Sir.

100
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,440
What’s…

101
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,340
Please try our liquor.

102
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,060
What’s the name of it?

103
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,860
Pear Blossom.

104
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Have a sip.

105
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,020
Can we?

106
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,900
Of course.

107
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,220
OK.

108
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,870
Smells good.

109
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,620
Here. Try some.

110
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,180
Get in.

111
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,020
Why are you hiding here?

112
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,940
I’m playing hide-and-seek with my dad.

113
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,220
Why?

114
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,580
They forget about me when they get busy.

115
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,020
I want to know how long he’ll find me.

116
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,310
Good liquor.

117
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,460
I’m impressed.

118
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,500
It’s good.

119
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,180
Really good.

120
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,220
Thank you.

121
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,940
Your dad will be worried.

122
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,460
He won’t.

123
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,500
He hasn’t seen me for a while.

124
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,980
But he didn’t look for me.

125
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,700
It’s not good.

126
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,340
Stop.

127
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,380
If you come out, I’ll be exposed.

128
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,500
Well, if I don’t,

129
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,070
my parents will be worried.

130
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,340
Then wait here and don’t come out

131
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,990
until they look for you, OK?

132
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
No.

133
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,500
Don’t go.

134
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,420
Let go.

135
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,380
What is it?

136
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,270
What’s going on?

137
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,060
Careful.

138
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,320
- Be careful.  - Weixun.

139
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,780
- What are you doing?  - Careful.

140
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,420
What’s going on?

141
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:23,940
- Dad.  - You stay here.

142
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,180
I’ll get something to clear up.

143
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,860
What were you doing?

144
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,500
Did you get hurt?

145
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,180
No, I’m fine.

146
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,580
- Apologize to them.  - No.

147
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,470
I’m so sorry.

148
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
My son is naughty.

149
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,110
I’ll cover all your losses.

150
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,260
It’s OK.

151
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,620
They’re just kids.

152
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,740
You don’t need to.

153
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,300
My wife told me

154
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,420
your Pear Blossom is fresh and has a rich taste.

155
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,780
Good liquor.

156
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,580
I want to buy some.

157
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,380
It would be better if we can make a deal.

158
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,580
Great. Great idea!

159
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,790
Thank you very much.

160
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,420
Right.

161
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,420
This is my card.

162
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,180
OK. Thank you. Thank you.

163
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,500
Wan, business card.

164
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,940
- Right.  - Business card.

165
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,460
Nice to meet you, sir.

166
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,860
This is my business card.

167
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,420
If you need to make an order,

168
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,500
please contact me.

169
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,220
OK.

170
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,300
- This is for you.  - Thank you.

171
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,860
Hey, let me get this.

172
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,140
This is a gift for you.

173
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,300
No, no, no. I can’t take it.

174
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,100
Do take it.

175
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,940
Just a little something for you.

176
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,860
Come on. There you go.

177
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,060
All right. Thank you.

178
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:16,980
Thanks.

179
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,140
Shall we?

180
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,340
Looking forward to our cooperation.

181
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,740
OK. OK.

182
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,340
Take care.

183
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,070
Let’s go.

184
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,580
Take care.

185
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Careful. It’s slippery.

186
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,220
Here. Over here.

187
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,980
President.

188
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,760
Mr. Lu, the President.

189
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,440
Be careful.

190
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,540
President of Lu Group of Binhai.

191
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,980
So you knew them then…

192
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,110
What happened afterwards?

193
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,940
Your mom was struck ill.

194
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,460
She couldn’t forget Pear Blossom,

195
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,700
believing that it was underrated.

196
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,780
But given He Wine Distillery’s condition,

197
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,860
they couldn’t meet the market demand.

198
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,260
And I

199
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,780
wanted to help your mom realize her dream.

200
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,510
So the idea of acquisition occurred to me.

201
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,500
So you contacted He Wangyou?

202
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,460
No.

203
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,060
I only had Wan Ran’s business card

204
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,860
when we bought the liquor.

205
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,220
So I contacted him.

206
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
Wan Ran?

207
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,860
So you contacted Wan Ran,

208
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,000
concerning the acquisition.

209
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,480
But we never had a deal.

210
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,780
It’s strange that they closed the distillery.

211
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,460
Why?

212
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,540
We never had a deal.

213
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,700
How could I know why?

214
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,700
But…

215
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,540
Hello?

216
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,680
Hello, Weixun.

217
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,060
What’s the situation with Buzui and Nanke?

218
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,270
What do you mean?

219
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,380
Where is Zeze?

220
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,820
You can’t even keep him inside?

221
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,460
Find him.

222
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,020
I don’t have much time to talk.

223
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,020
Pick me up at the People’s Hospital.

224
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,220
What’s up?

225
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,900
Dad, do you know the butterfly effect?

226
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,020
What is it?

227
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,740
One small action could lead to a disaster.

228
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,860
Hello?

229
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,540
Hello, Mr. Wan,

230
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,020
Zeze…

231
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,780
Zeze is missing.

232
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,460
What?

233
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,140
How did you let him get out?

234
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,630
Have some water.

235
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,180
My dad…

236
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,000
He didn’t do anything harmful to you, did he?

237
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,990
What are you talking about?

238
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,260
He asked someone to follow Miss He and Nanke

239
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,740
in the name of protecting me.

240
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,540
I don’t buy it.

241
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,630
But I can’t figure out what beef

242
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,300
they may have with my dad.

243
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,740
Pear Blossom.

244
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,820
There were rumors

245
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
that Yi Nanke’s father

246
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,420
had been missing since he stole

247
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
the recipe from He Wine Distillery,

248
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
until recently

249
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,180
his body

250
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,270
was found in your dad’s warehouse.

251
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,420
The police’s autopsy report indicates

252
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,900
that he’s been dead for almost 20 years.

253
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
Are you saying that my dad did it?

254
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,400
We don’t have solid evidence.

255
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,230
But he’s the prime suspect.

256
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,900
I’ll die loving you

257
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,500
Until I can’t love anymore

258
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
My love is so deep

259
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,220
That this is the only way to prove it

260
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,860
Mi Ya,

261
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,900
have an orange.

262
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,980
Leave me alone.

263
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,950
What’s that attitude? I’m here to see you.

264
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,880
What attitude?

265
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,060
I told you I’m not in the mood.

266
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,780
Stay out of my sight.

267
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,060
You’re grumpy.

268
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,940
I notice you didn’t go to the bar

269
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,500
or stay with Nanke.

270
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,980
And you seem to feel blue…

271
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Something happened.

272
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
He cheated on you?

273
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,060
Are you nuts?

274
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,510
What’s it to do with you?

275
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,620
Get your nose out of my business.

276
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,820
Mind your own first!

277
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:17,820
Hey,

278
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
why do you do that?

279
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,110
I care about you, OK?

280
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,040
Not necessary.

281
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,660
Shut up.

282
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,380
Mi Ya,

283
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,420
tell me.

284
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,660
Did he mistreat you?

285
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,380
If he did,

286
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,580
I’ll take it out on him now.

287
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,380
Wait here. I’m going to find him.

288
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,180
Can you beat him?

289
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,480
Pear Blossom you need.

290
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,180
Mu Chunfeng gave it to me.

291
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,900
Are you sure?

292
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,420
Let me have a try.

293
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,920
It’s a surprise you chose this place.

294
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,050
I would never forget the horror

295
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
you made me feel in here.

296
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,860
I’m sorry.

297
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,240
You’re different.

298
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,000
Different?

299
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,380
How so?

300
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,220
In the past,

301
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,700
you’d rather be beaten up

302
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,460
than apologize.

303
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,000
I’ll wait outside.

304
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,200
If you can’t do it, call me.

305
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,300
OK.

306
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,140
Sweet bunny

307
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,620
Open the door

308
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,900
Please open up

309
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,980
I want to come in

310
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,620
No, I won’t open up for you

311
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,300
Mom is not back yet

312
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,940
I won’t open for strangers

313
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,660
Sweet bunny

314
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,020
Open the door

315
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,340
Please open up

316
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,460
I want to come in

317
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Coming right now

318
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,700
Mom is back

319
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,780
Open the door now

320
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,940
Jianguo! Jianguo. Jianguo.

321
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,060
Let me explain.

322
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,830
Just pretend that you don’t see anything, OK?

323
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,260
You want the recipe.

324
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,230
How can I pretend not seeing it?

325
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,900
I have no choice.

326
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,460
How could you do this to Wangyou?

327
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,100
No way. I have to tell him.

328
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,540
Jianguo. Jianguo.

329
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,660
- I beg you.  - Move.

330
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,380
Come on.

331
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,740
Are you OK?

332
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:25,740
I…

333
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,140
I remember.

334
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,540
It’s Mr. Wan.

335
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,580
It’s Wan Ran.

336
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,780
I saw the murderer’s face.

337
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,300
His…his arm was scratched.

338
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,740
When I saw Wan Ran…

339
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,100
Mr. Wan,

340
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,820
please excuse us.

341
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,740
Have a good night.

342
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
You too.

343
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,340
He has a scar on his arm.

344
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,660
Mr. Wan,

345
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,060
are you aware

346
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,060
there might be a body buried here?

347
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,820
Be careful with what you say.

348
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,780
My dad,

349
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,750
he went to see my dad.

350
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,580
Yi Nanke.

351
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,300
Well.

352
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,420
You’re dating this girl?

353
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,700
Talk, don’t touch.

354
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,820
I’m not in the mood.

355
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,940
Really?

356
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,220
OK.

357
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,660
All right.

358
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,380
Answer me.

359
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,790
You’re done with my sister, right?

360
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,860
It’s none of your business.

361
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,400
She’s abducted because of you, you know?

362
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,580
Man up, will you?

363
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,940
Are you going to save her?

364
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,470
What did you say?

365
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,340
Mi Ya?

366
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,340
She…she was abducted?

367
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,550
What’s going on?

368
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,860
Ask him.

369
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,300
What did he do

370
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,900
to get my sister abducted?

371
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,360
We should call the police.

372
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,060
Where is she? I’ll go get her.

373
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,550
Come on. Let me show you.

374
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,340
We split up.

375
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,920
Take care of yourself.

376
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Let’s go.

377
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,460
Is Buzui home?

378
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,060
Dad!

379
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,220
Dad!

380
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,460
Dad!

381
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,020
It’s not safe here.

382
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,900
We need to go.

383
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,980
Dad! Dad!

384
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,580
Why is it not safe?

385
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,660
You remember.

386
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,180
What did you do to my dad?

387
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,380
What did you do to Zeze?

388
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,900
Why would we do anything to Zeze?

389
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,060
You don’t know?

390
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,300
Dad!

391
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,140
Dad!

392
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,140
Go.

393
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,300
Give me my phone!

394
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,660
Give it to me.

395
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,740
Give me my phone.

396
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,140
Tie her up.

397
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,980
Let go.

398
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,220
Dad!

399
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,220
Let me go.

400
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,260
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

401
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,940
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed…

402
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,180
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

403
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,940
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed…

404
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,740
Mi Ya, Mi Ya!

405
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,140
What?

406
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,580
What are you doing here?

407
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,940
You said we’re done.

408
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
You’re fine?

409
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Yes, I am.

410
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,420
Crap.

411
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,560
Take care of yourself.

412
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,940
What did he mean crap?

413
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,140
I watched you drown yourself in wine each day.

414
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,980
So I lied

415
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,750
and brought him over to you.

416
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,540
Crap? Oh, definitely.

417
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,340
I’m still pissed.

418
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,180
You know,

419
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,220
when I found him,

420
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,580
he was dating a girl called He Buzui.

421
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,460
Unbelievable!

422
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,060
Who?

423
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,500
He Buzui.

424
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,270
You made a huge mistake.

425
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,860
What did I do?

426
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,580
He Buzui!

427
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,980
He Buzui!

428
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,460
He Buzui!

429
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,580
He Buzui!

430
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,420
He Buzui!

431
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,900
Hello?

432
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,820
Hello,

433
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,220
does the number 87 remind you of anything?

434
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,080
What happened?

435
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,350
He Buzui is missing.

436
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,180
Come on. Think.

437
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,910
What does the number stand for?

438
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,660
I…

439
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,660
Wan Zeze,

440
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,100
her life is on the line.

441
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,630
Do you want to see your dad commit more crimes?

442
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,820
What does the number 87 mean?

443
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,180
This is the only chance to stop your dad.

444
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
The plate number.

445
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
I think it should be the plate number.

446
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,900
Bin AE 0587.

447
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,830
You’d better call the police.

448
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,659
You swear that you won’t hurt anybody else.

449
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,260
I swear.

450
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,139
I don’t want my dad to be a bad man.

451
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,980
Of course I’m not.

452
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,540
Hello,

453
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,699
call Hao Yong.

454
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,900
I’ll on my way now.

455
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,780
It’s urgent.

456
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,780
The subscriber you dialed…

457
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,630
He Buzui is missing.

458
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,460
I know Wan Ran took her.

459
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,700
It’s my fault.

460
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,260
She’ll be fine.

461
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Yes, she will.

462
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,620
Where is Lu Weixun?

463
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,820
He said it’s urgent.

464
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,960
He’ll be here soon.

465
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
Where is He Buzui?

466
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,620
Sorry,

467
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,580
I failed to protect her.

468
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,620
What did you do to her?

469
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,150
Hao Yong, calm down.

470
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,380
She’s kidnapped.

471
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,860
Calm down!

472
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,100
Lu Weixun, you bastard!

473
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,830
Hao Yong, you need to calm down.

474
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,150
She’s missing. We’re all worried.

475
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,140
Our priority is to find her.

476
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,140
Right.

477
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,820
We need to find her soon.

478
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,900
How?

479
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,540
The plate number is Bin AE0587.

480
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,300
It happened 20 minutes ago at No. 18 Hetao Road.

481
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,020
Got it.

482
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,780
Dear fans,

483
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,980
I need help to find a missing person. It’s urgent!

484
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,940
20 minutes ago at No. 18 Hetao Road,

485
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,060
a girl named He Buzui was kidnapped.

486
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,620
The plate of the kidnapper’s is Bin AE0587.

487
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,140
If you see it,

488
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,580
please share your location with me.

489
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,780
I’d appreciate it

490
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,070
if you could help me.

491
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,580
Friends watching my channel,

492
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,240
I need a favor to locate a girl.

493
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,940
Her name is He Buzui.

494
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,340
She’s kidnapped at No. 18 Hetao Road.

495
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,380
The plate of the kidnapper’s car is Bin AE 0587.

496
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,740
If you see this car,

497
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,380
please tell me your location.

498
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:32,980
Thank you.

499
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,340
Chunxiao Avenue.

500
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,140
Idol,

501
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,860
his car is out of town.

502
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:49,820
Idol,

503
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,980
I’ve tracked the car

504
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,580
to somewhere in the old town.

505
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,780
Few people watch my channel there.

506
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,940
I’m going to lose them.

507
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,500
I’m almost there.

508
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,460
Idol,

509
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,180
hold on. It’s too dangerous.

510
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,940
You’d better wait for the police.

511
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,620
I can’t.

512
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,500
Not even for a second.

513
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,980
Idol?

514
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,420
Idol?

515
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,220
He Buzui,

516
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,660
you must be OK.
