1
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
So,

2
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,940
do you have something important to tell me?

3
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,420
It is important.

4
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,460
Alright.

5
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,900
Let me guess.

6
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,300
OK.

7
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,540
I don’t think

8
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,950
you can get it right.

9
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,480
Have a seat.

10
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,300
He Buzui,

11
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,310
I want to be with you.

12
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,900
You want to be with me?

13
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,620
I want to be with you.

14
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,380
Mr. Lu,

15
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,460
Are you confessing right now?

16
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,150
Or what else?

17
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,500
I thought you’d ease into it.

18
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,180
Most importantly,

19
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,700
you should say I...

20
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,860
This doesn’t feel right.

21
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,930
Don’t you like playing it straight?

22
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,100
I’m expecting

23
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,900
more than this,

24
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,659
such as saying something romantic.

25
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,140
I like you.

26
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,820
What?

27
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,180
I didn’t hear you.

28
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,220
I said

29
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,700
I like you.

30
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,180
I like your smile,

31
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,270
your temper,

32
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,800
even your grumpiness.

33
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,900
So

34
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,380
I want to be with you

35
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,380
Let me put it on you.

36
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,720
Inside is perfume with the aroma of wine.

37
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,980
It’s strong.

38
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,460
Even though it’s kept inside,

39
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,860
you can still smell it.

40
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,820
It’s made especially for you.

41
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,300
I can smell it.

42
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,940
Raspberry,

43
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,780
blueberry.

44
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,300
It’s fruity

45
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
and enchanting.

46
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,980
I’m sure

47
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,780
you can sense

48
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,620
this unique smell.

49
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,940
So,

50
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,500
promise me,

51
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,660
Buzui,

52
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,820
to keep it for me.

53
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,060
OK?

54
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,180
You like it?

55
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,380
I do.

56
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,340
And me?

57
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,220
Thank you for everything.

58
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I love this unique necklace

59
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,900
and the beautiful fireworks.

60
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,340
I also

61
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,420
like you.

62
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,540
I’ll keep this necklace safe,

63
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,060
and I’ll

64
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,980
keep you safe.

65
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,500
Keep me safe?

66
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,420
Thank you, Mr. Lu, for giving me this chance

67
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,660
to protect the tough

68
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,940
yet sensitive Lu Weixun.

69
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,060
Buzui,

70
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,820
nobody has ever said that to me.

71
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
Thank you.

72
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,940
I’m willing to be your girlfriend.

73
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,260
Thank you for tonight.

74
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,740
More food would be nice,

75
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,350
but the fireworks were beautiful.

76
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,710
We can order more next time.

77
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,780
What’s wrong?

78
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,980
Nothing.

79
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Let’s go.

80
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,460
I also saw it.

81
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,500
Someone’s been watching us.

82
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,340
He’s been stalking us.

83
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,700
Should we bring him here

84
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,220
and question him?

85
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,150
For safety reasons,

86
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,390
let’s go home first.

87
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,060
What are you looking at?

88
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,020
Why can’t I look?

89
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,480
Can’t you get your eyes off me?

90
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,700
I will if I can.

91
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,380
Fine. Suit yourself.

92
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,480
I won't charge you.

93
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,580
I haven’t paid for the drinks

94
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,980
I ordered in your bar.

95
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,590
As long as my bar is open,

96
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,300
you can order a glass,

97
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
a bottle,

98
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,590
or a whole case without paying.

99
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,820
So I can drink for free?

100
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,780
Really?

101
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,750
Not exactly.

102
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,000
You can sing for me.

103
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,780
Fine.

104
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,220
From now on, if I

105
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,740
order drinks in your bar,

106
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,550
you can ask me to sing

107
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,180
as many songs

108
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,260
as you like.

109
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,060
I’ll comply.

110
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,100
Deal.

111
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,760
Have you seen Mi Di lately?

112
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,500
No.

113
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,340
He’s changed.

114
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,380
He heard stories about you

115
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,780
from others.

116
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,140
I have to say

117
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,540
you're a real badass.

118
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,060
Get out.

119
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,320
You...you...

120
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,100
What are you doing?

121
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,660
Stop.

122
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,340
Move.

123
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,180
Yi Nanke,

124
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,180
you're sentenced to 7 years in prison

125
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,940
for intentional assault.

126
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,860
Mi Ya,

127
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,100
you should know

128
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,900
I’m not a good man.

129
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,740
I fought a lot,

130
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,000
got arrested and imprisoned.

131
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,780
I told you I’m a mess.

132
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,380
The Yi Nanke I know

133
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,660
tells girls not to drink too much.

134
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,900
He’s willing to

135
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,860
sacrifice his own life for his brother.

136
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,100
You even helped

137
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
people like Mi Di.

138
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,980
You aren’t a mess to me.

139
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,900
Mi Ya,

140
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,960
you aren’t afraid of me at all?

141
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:52,860
I am.

142
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,830
I’m afraid the one I love

143
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,560
doesn't love himself.

144
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,700
I can’t wait to give you a stable life

145
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,580
but I’m not sure if I can.

146
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,780
Judging from your tone,

147
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,500
are you trying to

148
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,020
push me away?

149
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,920
You know I don't mean that.

150
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,420
I don’t.

151
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,620
Did you offend anyone lately?

152
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,980
I’m not sure.

153
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,340
Anyway,

154
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,100
let’s report it to the police tomorrow.

155
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,720
Good night.

156
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,340
Thank you for everything.

157
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,020
I had a great night.

158
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,820
Thank you.

159
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
I had fun, too.

160
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,140
I’m going to bed.

161
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,960
Good night.

162
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,359
Good night.

163
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,000
Mr. Wan,

164
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,200
we’ve found it.

165
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,180
Yi Nanke

166
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,900
is Yi Jianguo’s son. His dad used to

167
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,180
work for the He Wine Distillery.

168
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,620
They went to Yang’s winery

169
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,260
to look for Pear Blossom.

170
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,380
Luckily, he had gotten rid of it.

171
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,340
Too bad...

172
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,300
Don’t say a word to Zeze.

173
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,060
Yes.

174
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,660
You may leave.

175
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,500
What’s up?

176
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,910
Has someone been stalking you?

177
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,540
How did you know?

178
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,580
You've also...

179
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,180
I’ve been followed, too.

180
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,060
The only reason to follow us both is...

181
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,540
Pear Blossom.

182
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,060
Pear Blossom.

183
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,760
Don’t you think Mr. Yang’s death is suspicious?

184
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,100
It is.

185
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,900
What’s more,

186
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,340
even his family is missing.

187
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,440
Something doesn’t add up.

188
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,060
Who is behind all this?

189
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,780
I can think of someone.

190
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,700
He’s in the deep sea.

191
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
That’s OK.

192
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,260
I can swim.

193
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,600
I can’t go to your place today.

194
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,460
I need to go home to be with my dad.

195
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,420
OK.

196
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,870
Don’t worry.

197
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,580
I’m...

198
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,180
here.

199
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
What took you so long?

200
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
All taken care of.

201
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,180
What did you do?

202
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,580
That’s unorthodox.

203
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,910
We’re the only ones here. Go ahead and ask.

204
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,500
Yi Nanke,

205
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,620
we’re law-abiding citizens.

206
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,500
Can’t you be

207
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,340
less violent?

208
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,180
Do you have a better way

209
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,860
to crack this turd?

210
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Sorry.

211
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
He Buzui,

212
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,220
what the hell are you doing?

213
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,980
Be polite to girls.

214
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,100
Miss He,

215
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,220
what can I do for you?

216
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,100
Did you

217
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,780
ask someone to follow me?

218
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,580
No, I swear I didn’t.

219
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,820
Why would I do that?

220
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,620
You know Yang Feng?

221
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,220
Who?

222
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,420
Have you heard of Joy Winery?

223
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,380
I have.

224
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,140
Their wine tastes like feet.

225
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,340
Dragon Winery’s is much better.

226
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,660
It’s tasty.

227
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,580
You know...

228
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,080
Know what Pear Blossom is?

229
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,980
You...you mean the flower?

230
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,540
Look,

231
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
I’m telling the truth.

232
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,900
I swear. It’s all true.

233
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,780
I promise.

234
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,000
He didn’t do it.

235
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Sorry about this.

236
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,140
It’s OK.

237
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,500
Well, sir,

238
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,260
I get it.

239
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,060
You must be in trouble.

240
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,740
If you don’t mind,

241
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,140
I’m willing to help.

242
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,420
I can

243
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
help you find those cheap bastards.

244
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Thank you.

245
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,380
No problem.

246
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,620
Happy to help.

247
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,420
See you.

248
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Have a nice day.

249
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,900
De,

250
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,980
I’d appreciate it

251
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,300
if you could keep this from Lu Weixun.

252
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,300
Young lady,

253
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,580
you almost got me killed.

254
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,300
Hey, listen,

255
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,030
I’m telling you,

256
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,640
you must think carefully.

257
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,260
This guy

258
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,140
isn’t as gentle as the last one.

259
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,860
Choose wisely.

260
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,260
Come here.

261
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,020
Untie me.

262
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,960
Untie the rope.

263
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,380
Hey,

264
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,260
wait,

265
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,700
untie me first.

266
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,820
What is she thinking?

267
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,300
Hello?

268
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,460
Come back.

269
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,420
Don’t be childish.

270
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,860
No.

271
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,140
You don’t have a choice.

272
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,300
You can’t taste anything now.

273
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,740
True.

274
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,630
I’ve lost my palate.

275
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,660
Nevertheless,

276
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,580
I’ll stick to my own path.

277
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,260
Don't be naive.

278
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,660
You and I are different.

279
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,180
Like father, like son.

280
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,700
How are we different?

281
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,020
I’ve found my own partner.

282
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,900
Your partner?

283
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,220
What can your partner do?

284
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,300
Can your partner help you solve

285
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,020
your financial crisis?

286
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,340
I can handle it myself.

287
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,540
Can you? How?

288
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,340
By being stubborn and childish?

289
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,060
Listen,

290
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,120
once news gets out that you’ve lost your palate,

291
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,300
shareholders will withdraw their investment.

292
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,820
Tell me,

293
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,140
what will you do then?

294
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,500
I won’t let you

295
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,260
embarrass me.

296
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,740
Embarrass you?

297
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,580
Sure,

298
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,420
all you care about is your business,

299
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,500
your image.

300
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,580
Look,

301
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,840
let’s have a match.

302
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,700
A duel event.

303
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,220
If I win,

304
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,360
you cannot interfere with my winery ever again.

305
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,460
OK.

306
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,880
If you lose,

307
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,820
you must work for our family business.

308
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,100
I’ll show you

309
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,980
how ridiculous your arrogance and ignorance are.

310
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,180
You can try.

311
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,460
Don’t forget

312
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,260
you inherit your palate from me.

313
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,100
Orange wine is made from white wine grapes,

314
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
using the technique of making red wine.

315
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,220
Fully mix the skin, pulp, and juice.

316
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,900
The skin won't be removed even after fermentation.

317
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,100
The process may last for hours, weeks,

318
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,500
or even months.

319
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,060
The final produce

320
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,700
contains the flavor of the white wine

321
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,740
and the richness of the red wine.

322
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,500
Orange is the new white.

323
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,820
He is good.

324
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,500
Who is he?

325
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,900
Mr. Lu,

326
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,140
he’s

327
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,220
Mu Chunfeng.

328
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,180
The most outstanding new talent.

329
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,940
No wonder.

330
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:14,960
Master.

331
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,620
Chunfeng,

332
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,400
clear your schedule for next Monday.

333
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,860
Let’s go challenge Lu Weixun.

334
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,140
us against Lu Weixun?

335
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,180
Yes.

336
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,540
And his partner.

337
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,180
What?

338
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,590
You don't have time?

339
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,460
I do.

340
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,580
I’m not sure why you pick me.

341
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,380
You’re my best student.

342
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,420
Didn’t you say

343
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,860
you’d win Buck Winery back fair and square?

344
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,940
Sir, Mr. Mu has arrived.

345
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,420
OK. You may leave.

346
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,580
Mr. Lu.

347
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,860
Have a seat.

348
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,780
If you fancy orange wine,

349
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,900
you can go to Georgia.

350
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,540
Some wineries there

351
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,460
bury the jars underground

352
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
for fermentation.

353
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,420
It’s a ritual.

354
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,140
Europe is home to wine.

355
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,300
In Georgia,

356
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,740
people still use

357
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,740
ancient techniques to make wine.

358
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
If possible,

359
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,780
I’ll introduce you

360
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,460
to the best winemaker there.

361
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,940
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

362
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,540
You can call me master.

363
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,040
Thank you, master.

364
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,300
Come, have a seat.

365
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,280
It’s my pleasure to be there with you.

366
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,540
So many files!

367
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,790
What are you doing here?

368
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,620
To pick you up.

369
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,580
I have a match in a few days.

370
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,600
I hope you can be there with me.

371
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,180
OK.

372
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,940
Aren’t you gonna ask why?

373
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,420
No need.

374
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,660
I’ll win.

375
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,060
Of course.

376
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,260
Hao Yong,

377
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,580
please take care of my dad.

378
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,660
Sure.

379
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,580
Leave it to me.

380
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,300
I’m free these days.

381
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,790
I really appreciate it.

382
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,100
please.

383
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,300
Are you still that He Buzui I know?

384
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:50,910
Alright.

385
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,310
Go ahead.

386
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
See you.

387
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,860
- Bye.  - Bye-bye.  - See you.

388
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,180
You didn’t tell me

389
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,780
your dad needed company.

390
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,340
My dad is old now.

391
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,800
It’s better to have someone with him.

392
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,020
Right.

393
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:17,820
Dad.

394
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,020
Hello. Mr. Wan is out.

395
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,740
You killed my husband Yang!

396
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,380
You're a murderer!

397
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,020
Pardon?

398
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,180
You're a killer!

399
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
This chicken soup

400
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
is the best.

401
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,100
Have some.

402
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,380
It can warm you up.

403
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,140
I’ll have some, too.

404
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,940
What’s wrong?

405
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,580
You have no appetite?

406
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,580
Dad,

407
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,820
how did Mr. Yang die?

408
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,260
Zeze,

409
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,540
we don’t get to

410
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,640
eat together a lot.

411
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,300
Can we not talk about

412
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,180
things like death while eating?

413
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,180
Why?

414
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,430
That’s a life we’re talking about.

415
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,260
Zeze, stop.

416
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,220
How did Mr. Yang die?

417
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,100
I told you already.

418
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,140
He acted on impulse.

419
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,380
I went to your office this afternoon. You were out,

420
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,110
and your phone was on the table.

421
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,740
It rang and I answered it.

422
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,460
The caller was Mr. Yang’s wife.

423
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,060
Zeze,

424
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,780
you're a kid.

425
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,180
There are things you shouldn’t know.

426
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,140
So what they said is true?

427
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,740
It was all your idea.

428
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,550
Mr. Yang took the blame for you.

429
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,820
Zhong.

430
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,700
Mr. Wan,

431
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,660
Zeze,

432
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,660
Zhong said you aren’t in good shape.

433
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,980
You’d better

434
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,580
be hospitalized.

435
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,140
Let’s go, Zeze.

436
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,180
Mr. Wan's arranged everything.

437
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,580
Hold on.

438
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,710
Let him finish this meal first.

439
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,720
I need to go.

440
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,280
You can eat without me.

441
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,210
Mr. He, food is ready.

442
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,739
Let’s eat.

443
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,020
Coming.

444
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,170
Mr. Wan,

445
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,510
Hao Yong.

446
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,830
Why are you here?

447
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,580
Buzui asked me to take care of Mr. He.

448
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,820
You’re...

449
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,000
I’m here to visit Wangyou.

450
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,500
I see. I’ll go cook a few more dishes.

451
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,159
Have a seat.

452
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,100
Wangyou.

453
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:45,780
It’s me.

454
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,860
Wan Ran.

455
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,770
Look what the cat dragged in!

456
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,739
Have a seat.

457
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,020
I’ll go make some tea.

458
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,420
No need. Come back.

459
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,420
Sit.

460
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,460
You too.

461
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,260
Long time no see.

462
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,980
Indeed.

463
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,820
You're making Pear Blossom again?

464
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,260
For my daughter’s wedding.

465
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,980
Buzui has a boyfriend?

466
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,220
She’s about age. A big girl.

467
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,740
What a pity!

468
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,580
If your winery weren’t closed,

469
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,300
Pear Blossom could be her dowry.

470
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,140
No big deal.

471
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,540
With Jianguo’s help,

472
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,260
it won’t take long to make some more.

473
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,460
Jianguo?

474
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,180
Where is he?

475
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,460
Why isn’t here to help you?

476
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,260
Jianguo?

477
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Jianguo? Jianguo?

478
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,660
He and his son went to the movie.

479
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,180
Mr. Wan, please.

480
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,820
Sit and eat with us.

481
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,980
Food is ready.

482
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,380
Thank you, but I’m needed elsewhere.

483
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,180
I’m leaving.

484
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,260
See you.

485
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,300
Take care, Mr. Wan.

486
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:01,980
Drive safe.

487
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,620
Sure.

488
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,980
See you.

489
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,100
Let’s eat, Mr. He.

490
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,620
Buzui still hasn't come back.

491
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,680
Let’s wait for her.

492
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,140
I’ll go get more rice.

493
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,140
Go ahead.

494
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,780
Hello, Mr. Wan.

495
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,180
When shall we act?

496
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,860
Wait for my order.

497
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,820
How’s Yang’s family?

498
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,180
Rest assured, sir.

499
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
All taken care of.

500
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,660
They won’t yap again.

501
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,900
Your confidence in front of your father

502
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,940
is just an act.

503
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,020
So many years have passed.

504
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,900
You still can’t let it go.

505
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,860
Who are you?

506
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,940
You don't know?

507
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,220
I...

508
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
am you.

509
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,580
I’m the one you've forgotten about

510
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,460
and abandoned.

511
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,400
You aren’t as handsome as I imagined.

512
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,110
You aren’t as cute as I thought.

513
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,300
Why are you here alone?

514
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,500
Where’s dad?

515
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,180
Where's mom?

516
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,980
They left.

517
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,700
Liar!

518
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,340
Mom is always with me.

519
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,140
Dad is busy,

520
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,140
but he also tries to be with me

521
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,540
as long as he can.

522
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,900
We’ll always be together.

523
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,900
Is that a dream?
