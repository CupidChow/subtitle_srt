1
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,660
Flavour It’s Yours

2
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,860
Our last choice

3
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
is to ask Yi Beidao to mix those drinks again.

4
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,979
No way.

5
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,300
I won't.

6
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,100
You can’t go either.

7
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,300
Why?

8
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,500
I’d rather lose my palate

9
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,180
than let you take the risk.

10
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,180
That man in the bar

11
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,860
isn’t Yi Beidao.

12
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,020
Yi Beidao has passed away.

13
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,660
He’s Yi Nanke,

14
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,600
Yi Beidao’s twin brother.

15
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,980
Yi Nanke?

16
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,540
He believes

17
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,700
his brother

18
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,700
and father died

19
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,500
because of my family.

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,900
That’s even worse.

21
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,300
You don’t know

22
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,420
what he will do.

23
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,560
But we have to face these things sooner or later.

24
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,990
If we won’t go there,

25
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,550
we can’t get our taste back.

26
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,660
I don’t care.

27
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,750
Anyway, you can’t go there.

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,060
Fine.

29
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,620
I can taste things anyway.

30
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,550
I’m not worried.

31
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,820
What a brat!

32
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,940
Start cooking!

33
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,460
Whatever.

34
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,030
I wish I could keep the palate forever.

35
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,340
He’s not going anywhere!

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,960
Why bother eating anyway?

37
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,420
If someday I want to tour around the world,

38
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,220
may I circle around you?

39
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,180
So cheesy and hokey.

40
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,950
Can’t show my sincerity at all.

41
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,540
Why not travel around the world

42
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,800
with the girl instead?

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,260
Hypocrite.

44
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,360
Are you interested in a romantic relationship?

45
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,220
That's

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,980
a bit blunt.

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,460
Not classy enough.

48
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,380
But He Buzui

49
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,220
might fancy this style.

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,860
Write it down.

51
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,460
Are you interested in a romantic relationship?

52
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,540
Do you have a girlfriend?

53
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,459
If not, do you want one?

54
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,380
If yes, do you want a new one?

55
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,140
Or, do you want an extra one?

56
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,940
Disgusting!

57
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,340
If girlfriends can be changed so easily,

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,270
what’s the point of being sincere?

59
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,510
You were inside of my heart when you were thin.

60
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,540
Once you gained weight, you couldn’t get out.

61
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,100
Good one.

62
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,460
But

63
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,420
will He Buzui like it?

64
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,820
Well, she does like playing outside the box.

65
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,870
Write it down first.

66
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,820
So good!

67
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,860
I’m a master chef.

68
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,820
Why not call me for dinner?

69
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,220
You come downstairs anyway.

70
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,940
You aren’t too short.

71
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,460
Shut up and eat.

72
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,580
Fine.

73
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,020
You're

74
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,540
a tad too short.

75
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,220
I know, OK?

76
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Being short is the new sexy.

77
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,540
Do you have any common sense?

78
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,870
Don’t you know height difference is cute?

79
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,580
Height difference?

80
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Short girls are popular.

81
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,700
If you can’t reach anything,

82
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,860
I can help you.

83
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,420
Let me hold it!

84
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Walking in the park on a rainy day?

85
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,220
What are you thinking?

86
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,580
Do you learn this move from chick flicks?

87
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,100
If you don’t want it, give it back to me.

88
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,140
I want it.

89
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,860
It’s cold.

90
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,100
Since when has Weixun become

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,700
so caring?

92
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,220
He gave her his scarf!

93
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,180
It’s all that woman’s fault.

94
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,420
Let’s go back.

95
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,540
What’s more, he didn’t put the scarf on her.

96
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,350
I don’t care.

97
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,780
I need to watch their every move.

98
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,670
What good will come out of that?

99
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,230
You’ll only become sadder.

100
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,060
Shut up!

101
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,020
Look,

102
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,740
someone is playing the violin.

103
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Playing it in the rain?

104
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,020
It’s beautiful,

105
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,700
but I have a sense of sadness.

106
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,300
That’s Robert Schumann’s work.

107
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,220
He composed it

108
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,340
for his spouse Clara.

109
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,420
It’s said

110
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,940
Schumann fell in love with Clara

111
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,820
when she was 11.

112
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,340
He waited for seven years

113
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,950
before they were in love secretly.

114
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,299
Her father found out about their relationship

115
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,900
and was strongly against it.

116
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,789
Eventually,

117
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,620
they got married

118
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,860
when Clara turned 21.

119
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,900
Although they were struggling to make a living,

120
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,740
they were soul mates in music

121
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,340
and in life.

122
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,380
And

123
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,670
they lived happily ever after.

124
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,060
That’s a long story.

125
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,820
I’m glad they loved each other

126
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,740
and didn’t have any regrets.

127
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,780
True.

128
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,100
Love is

129
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,780
invincible.

130
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,380
Are you feeling cold?

131
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,000
Would you like some black tea?

132
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,030
Why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?

133
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
I don’t want tea.

134
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,230
Sweet chestnuts would be nice.

135
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,100
Sure.

136
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,740
What a witch!

137
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,020
She asked my prince to buy

138
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,980
humble snacks like chestnuts?

139
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,060
You're focusing on the wrong thing.

140
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,780
Whatever!

141
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,220
Milky tea and sweet chestnuts

142
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,740
are for commoners.

143
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,300
Why don’t you try it yourself?

144
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,620
Know yourself and know your enemy, right?

145
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,260
I know a store sells delicious chestnuts.

146
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,060
Not interested.

147
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,700
Let’s go.

148
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,980
Boring.

149
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,260
Smoke is the key to sweet chestnuts.

150
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,820
Where there’s smoke,

151
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,760
there’s a long line of customers.

152
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,940
Taste it.

153
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,460
It’s a lot of work.

154
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,420
Why would anyone eat it?

155
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,740
There’s a trick for everything.

156
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,300
With the right trick,

157
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,430
everything is easy.

158
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,420
The wrong one

159
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,940
will only make things worse.

160
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,820
So do you have any idea

161
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,980
to separate that woman from Lu Weixun?

162
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,310
Find her weak spots,

163
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,310
and tackle it one by one.

164
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,060
Try it.

165
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
It’s good.

166
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,380
You have to go see him?

167
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,700
For myself

168
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,340
and your palate,

169
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,040
it must be done.

170
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,260
We need to act wisely.

171
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,580
How?

172
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,920
We’re his least favorite people.

173
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,980
Do you think

174
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,220
he’ll agree to help us?

175
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,260
What’s your plan?

176
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,420
We need someone whom he listens to.

177
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,460
Whom does he listen to?

178
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,100
It’s time. My turn.

179
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,460
No peeping.

180
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,500
What is it that I can’t see?

181
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,460
Lu Weixun is naked.

182
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,420
Let me see.

183
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,030
Move way.

184
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,860
Hello, Mr. Ma.

185
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
What?

186
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,820
They're talking about

187
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,220
Rose Winery.

188
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,300
It’s important.

189
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,100
Our things can wait.

190
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,380
Tomorrow...

191
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,180
Together?

192
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,740
I knew she is up to no good.

193
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,380
She’s seducing my man!

194
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,380
What’s wrong?

195
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,340
You know,

196
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,100
Lu Weixun is taking that woman

197
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
to Rose Winery to taste the new wine.

198
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,220
I can’t let them be there alone.

199
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,100
I must go.

200
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,140
Won’t you?

201
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,940
They’re there for pricing.

202
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,180
I don’t think routine work like that

203
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,420
can improve Lu Weixun’s palate.

204
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,300
I’ll go.

205
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,140
Bai Jing?

206
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,460
Surprise!

207
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,580
You didn’t leave?

208
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,900
Let me explain.

209
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,060
I still have unfinished business here,

210
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,920
so I’m staying for a few more days.

211
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,580
Don’t think

212
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,260
I’m staying for you.

213
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,540
Although you're my fiancé...

214
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,500
I’ll say it one more time.

215
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,420
I’m not your fiancé.

216
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,540
Don’t say that again,

217
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,180
or I’ll ask your dad to bring you back.

218
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,980
Fine, I’m sorry.

219
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,260
Don’t be so serious.

220
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,420
I won’t say it again.

221
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,860
Aren’t you here to taste the new wine?

222
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,380
I can help you.

223
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,460
That’s why I’m here.

224
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,420
You tasted it?

225
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,220
Of course.

226
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,660
What do you think?

227
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,900
I’m a professional.

228
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,060
But,

229
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,020
I’m not sure how good

230
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,220
your assistant is.

231
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,260
Mr. Ma,

232
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,380
bring her the wine.

233
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,580
OK. Hold on.

234
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,180
Miss Bai,

235
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,310
here’s the wine.

236
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,660
White birch,

237
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,420
tastes like spring

238
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,460
and strawberry.

239
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,700
Any newbie knows that.

240
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,420
A family is having a picnic.

241
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,700
A stream is flowing.

242
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,780
Beside the stream,

243
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,260
the three of them are playing games.

244
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,860
Strawberries and bushes are around them.

245
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,300
The woman in a denim overalls

246
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,820
is spreading a cloth on the lawn.

247
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,580
The man wearing a white shirt, barefoot,

248
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,540
is playing on the ground

249
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,940
with his son.

250
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,220
A bottle of wine

251
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,780
with no label is in the woman’s hand.

252
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
It’s sparkling rose.

253
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,220
Where’s the bottle from?

254
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,300
From a cool…

255
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,819
From the stream.

256
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,180
How do you know?

257
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,020
This rosé is entry-level.

258
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,380
Weixun knows everything about it

259
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
without tasting

260
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,619
or smelling it.

261
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,380
The boy and his dad

262
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,980
are covered with grass seeds and white flowers.

263
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,860
Yes. Right.

264
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,260
But why those images

265
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,510
appear in my mind after tasting it?

266
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,960
What do you think about this wine?

267
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,620
It's interesting

268
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,640
and there’s a story behind it.

269
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,300
Inspirational.

270
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,420
“Interesting”?

271
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,900
That’s your professional opinion?

272
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,780
My fiancé...

273
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,860
Fine, fine, fine.

274
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,060
I mean

275
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,540
Weixun’s wine

276
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,350
is definitely of high quality.

277
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,860
Besides, this rosé is new.

278
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,860
It deserves a high price.

279
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,420
High price?

280
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,180
Yeah.

281
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,300
100.

282
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,820
200 maximum.

283
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,340
I've seen all the records

284
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,380
of this winery for the last ten years,

285
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,840
plus the prizes it has won.

286
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,380
Any wine from Rose Winery

287
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,500
can be sold at

288
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,140
$50 or above.

289
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,380
This rosé

290
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,340
is not aged in new oak barrels.

291
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,700
Nothing special about its production.

292
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,020
Grapes and labor are the only cost,

293
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,220
and it’s not well received in China.

294
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,220
It doesn’t stand out.

295
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,260
Nothing about it can be used

296
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,580
for promotion.

297
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,100
But we can hire

298
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,940
the best French illustrator to design the label.

299
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,620
Besides, this is the first wine Weixun made

300
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,900
since his identity of winemaker was made public.

301
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,620
It can be

302
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,020
a commemorative wine.

303
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,340
In my opinion,

304
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,550
this wine can be sold

305
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,540
at $130 to $150.

306
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,500
Easy.

307
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,300
USD?

308
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,700
I meant RMB.

309
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,580
Are you kidding me?

310
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,840
You mean RMB 200 per glass, right?

311
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,420
This wine is tasty,

312
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,380
but...

313
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,180
But what?

314
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,860
It’s just a bottle of drink.

315
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,460
Price it so high

316
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,260
that ordinary people can’t afford it.

317
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,220
Isn’t our goal

318
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,300
to make more people enjoy wine?

319
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,100
You heard that? She’s being unreasonable.

320
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,700
I agree with her.

321
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,140
What? You took her side?

322
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,500
You’ll ruin this brand,

323
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,380
you know?

324
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,660
Gosh, I can’t believe it!

325
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,500
Bai Jing.

326
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,980
I heard you and Bai Jing

327
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,380
are both WSA master Patrick’s students.

328
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,380
I’m sure her advice is worth considering.

329
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,980
I don't doubt her expertise,

330
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,420
but she mainly stays in Europe.

331
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,820
There’s a difference

332
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,580
between the European market

333
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,910
and the Chinese market.

334
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,280
I don’t know much about it.

335
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,070
Sorry, I can’t help you.

336
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,420
Other than that,

337
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,260
I’m not sure

338
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,260
how much this wine is worth

339
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,420
before tasting it.

340
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,820
Setting the price like this

341
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,100
isn’t fair to the wine itself

342
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,100
and those

343
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,580
who like it.

344
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,540
That might sound arrogant and irrational,

345
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,780
but

346
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,460
that's what you care about.

347
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,340
So,

348
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,020
our priority

349
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,380
is to restore your palate.

350
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,140
I know who can help us

351
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,020
talk to Yi Nanke.

352
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,500
Who?

353
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,100
Mi Ya.

354
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,580
She told me everything

355
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,420
about Yi Nanke.

356
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,340
I think

357
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,340
he must’ve trusted her so much

358
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,860
that he was willing to tell her his secrets.

359
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,020
What is it?

360
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,020
Speak.

361
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,300
Nothing serious.

362
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
It's boring. You don’t need to know.

363
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,580
Say it, or I’ll deduct your wage.

364
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,180
So,

365
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,940
are you and Bai Jing really engaged?

366
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,700
Unbelievable!

367
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,940
Yes.

368
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,620
No.

369
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,260
Not at all.

370
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,980
But she seems so sure about it.

371
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,660
She made a mistake.

372
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,140
Weixun,

373
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,230
dinner is ready.

374
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,900
Mom,

375
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,660
am I engaged with Mr. Bai’s daughter?

376
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,980
No.

377
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,300
Your marriage

378
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,140
is up to you.

379
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,140
Bai Jing keeps saying we're engaged.

380
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,500
It’s annoying.

381
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,820
She probably likes you.

382
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,220
We and the Bais are friends for generations.

383
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,600
Don’t take it to heart.

384
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,360
Come, let’s go eat.

385
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,060
What’s wrong?

386
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,300
There, there.

387
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,830
Your makeup will be ruined.

388
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,620
Do you know

389
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
I’m so pissed?

390
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,140
I tried to help Lu Weixun price the wine,

391
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,540
but he didn’t trust me.

392
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,580
He even taught He Buzui wine tasting.

393
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,500
I begged him for years to teach me,

394
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,780
but he turned me down.

395
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,380
Pricing the new wine is easy.

396
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,980
Why would he bother others?

397
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,380
He took that chance to teach his assistant.

398
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,780
I do think

399
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,280
there is another reason behind that.

400
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,780
What do you mean?

401
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,220
Like what?

402
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,660
Try my dish.

403
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,940
You can cook French soup!

404
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Not bad.

405
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,260
But Weixun’s cooking skill

406
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,700
is better.

407
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,820
I have a question.

408
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,260
How did Lu Weixun become your fiancé?

409
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,500
Well,

410
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,140
his mom adored me,

411
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,700
but she became sick

412
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,790
and passed away.

413
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,180
Why do you two want to see me?

414
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,380
To be honest,

415
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,380
we need a favour

416
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,740
I’m listening.

417
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,580
I’ll help you if I can.

418
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,220
Can you go to The Bar and order two drinks?

419
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,500
What exactly?

420
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,420
One Margarita,

421
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,140
one Bloody Mary.

422
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,900
Can you tell me why?

423
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,700
Long story.

424
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,060
Why pick me?

425
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,420
Because he trusts you the most.

426
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:33,940
Sure.

427
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,860
I have two questions.

428
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,460
First,

429
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,120
will Yi Nanke get hurt?

430
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,900
No.

431
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,060
We simply want to find out the truth.

432
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,820
He only needs to mix the drinks.

433
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,100
Second,

434
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,900
is this important to you?

435
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,380
It is.

436
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,220
OK.

437
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,460
What brings you here?

438
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,380
I miss your drinks.

439
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,430
What do you want?

440
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,620
One Bloody Mary,

441
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,580
one Margarita.

442
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Not the usual one.

443
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,620
I’d like a change.

444
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,470
Coming right up.

445
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,380
So what's up?

446
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,660
Mu Chunfeng’s article

447
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,980
will be published soon.

448
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,340
It's being finalized.

449
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Mu Chunfeng?

450
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,550
The one who came with you last time?

451
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,020
He’s better than Lu Weixun.

452
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,580
You speak highly of him.

453
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,820
Why are you staring at me?

454
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,660
You don’t like him?

455
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,740
I don’t.

456
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,180
Why?

457
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,590
Gut feeling.

458
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,620
Your gut isn’t always right.

459
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,340
Sorry,

460
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,400
you aren't welcomed here.

461
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,550
We’re here to drink,

462
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,540
not to pick fights.

463
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,580
Relax.

464
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,980
Beidao,

465
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,460
sorry,

466
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,140
Mr. Yi,

467
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
please,

468
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,300
don't get us wrong.

469
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,420
What are you doing, Mi Ya?

470
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,500
Calm down.

471
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,140
Let them finish first.

472
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
Tastes the same as the previous one.

473
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,580
Wrong one.

474
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,780
No change.

475
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,960
This isn’t the one.

476
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,860
The base wine is different.

477
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,300
Are you doing this on purpose, He Buzui?

478
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,920
What is wrong with you two?

479
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,300
As the owner of this bar,

480
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
I’m asking you to leave now.

481
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,780
Sorry,

482
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,420
it’s not what you think.

483
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,940
Don’t mistake it.

484
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,460
We need your drinks for an experiment.

485
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,350
Don't waste time on him.

486
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,430
All the variations are confirmed.

487
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,020
Except for the base wine.

488
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,660
What did you use?

489
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,740
No matter who you are

490
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,180
or why you approached me,

491
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,220
I can live with all that.

492
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,420
But this

493
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,500
is really important to us.

494
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,140
Remember I told you

495
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,260
my palate is back.

496
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,540
This base wine might be the cause.

497
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,460
The base wine?

498
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:28,940
Yes.

499
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,260
I told you

500
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,940
I don’t believe in miracles.

501
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,340
Yet you come here to look for the cause of it.

502
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,230
Don’t you see the irony?

503
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,580
Just tell us what you used.

504
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,740
Yi Nanke.

505
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,260
You told them?

506
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,860
Yes.

507
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,380
I told them

508
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,980
you aren’t Yi Beidao.

509
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,940
You're Yi Nanke.

510
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,740
You should clear up all misunderstandings

511
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,540
and find out the truth together.

512
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,140
Mi Ya, I trusted you so much.

513
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,300
How could you betray me?

514
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,220
Since you hate He Buzui,

515
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,980
don’t you want to know

516
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,180
what happened to her?

517
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,740
I only did this to help you.

518
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,980
Help me?

519
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,340
She said she doesn’t know that base wine.

520
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,900
That’s a lie!

521
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,660
Why should I know?

522
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,060
I really don't.

523
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,540
It's Pear Blossom.

524
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,220
Pear Blossom?

525
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:40,660
Here.

526
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,710
A special drink.

527
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,580
Looks like Bloody Mary though.

528
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,620
I used a different base wine.

529
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,020
The favor isn’t the same.

530
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,340
I want the same drink.

531
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,740
Lu Weixun,

532
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,420
seriously?

533
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,900
Can’t you leave me alone?

534
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,020
It’s good.

535
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,220
Do you use the liquor for the base wine?

536
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,820
Spot on.

537
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,140
I think I’ve had it before.

538
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,820
Yes,

539
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,540
Pear Blossom,

540
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,260
the liquor made

541
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,270
your family’s distillery famous,

542
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,940
the cause of my dad’s disappearance.

543
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,740
I’ll never forget its flavor.

544
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,780
Pear Blossom!

545
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,740
What?

546
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,460
Doesn’t your family own the distillery?

547
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,920
You couldn’t even tell it is your own liquor?

548
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,790
Do you have more of this liquor?

549
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,710
I fed the last sip to a dog

550
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,420
on the anniversary

551
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,520
of my brother’s death.

552
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,100
Mi Ya,

553
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,620
we're leaving then.

554
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,500
Thank you.

555
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,620
Please don’t tell others

556
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,310
about our taste disorders.

557
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,179
Aren’t you afraid

558
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,260
I’ll expose it?

559
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,460
It’s a scoop after all.

560
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,699
We had no choice

561
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,620
but to tell you.

562
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:38,940
We hope you can help us with the investigation,

563
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,460
and

564
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,100
we don’t want you to mistake our action.

565
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,860
It was for work.

566
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,100
We trust you.

567
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,140
Gotta go, bye.

568
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,020
Sorry about that.

569
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,620
My heart aches

570
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,000
seeing you in pain.

571
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,830
All these years,

572
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,180
I've been living with pain every night.

573
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,700
I’m used to it.

574
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,920
That’s why I want to find out the truth

575
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,220
to end your hatred

576
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,980
and free you from your suffering.

577
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,710
It pains me more seeing that you're helping them.

578
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,220
Yi Nanke,

579
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,140
if it has anything to do

580
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,660
with Pear Blossom,

581
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,190
you have more reasons to cooperate with them.

582
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,500
I don’t think they lied.

583
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,260
The risk is too high.

584
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,420
In this world,

585
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,950
so many things can’t be explained by science.

586
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,180
I respect their occurrence.

587
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,820
But why should I pay the price?

588
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,260
Maybe you're trapped by yourself.

589
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,300
You aren't me.

590
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,380
You don't know how I feel.

591
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,580
I’m trying.

592
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,000
I really don’t want to see you suffer.

593
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,500
Why didn’t you let me finish?

594
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,260
What’s more to say?

595
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,780
What if they mistook

596
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,180
our relationship?

597
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,390
Mistook us for what?

598
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,940
They might think we're a couple.

599
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,910
What’s wrong with that?

600
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,580
Why do you have to explain it?

601
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,140
Why are you so eager to

602
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,670
clarify our relationship?

603
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,500
Why are you so mad?

604
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,750
I’m concerned about your reputation.

605
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,500
I mean

606
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,900
things aren’t going well.

607
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,820
You're expelled

608
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,180
and the business isn’t picking up.

609
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,580
What if they spread rumors

610
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,020
that we’re in love?

611
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,020
I don't mind!

612
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,280
You don’t mind the rumors?

613
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,020
It’s my freedom

614
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,900
whether to explain it or not.

615
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,220
You’re a mystery.

616
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,020
Am I mysterious?

617
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,180
Mind your own business.

618
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,020
Think about that Pear Blossom thing.

619
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,300
I didn’t know your family made liquor.

620
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,420
My dad used to own a distillery.

621
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,500
Pear Blossom he made was extremely popular.

622
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,540
Maybe something in the liquor

623
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,800
is good for the health.

624
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,980
The doctor also said

625
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,510
certain element could help

626
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,740
the palate to recover.

627
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,100
So

628
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,580
can your dad make it now?

629
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,220
I doubt it.

630
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,620
He’s been haunted by that liquor for decades.

631
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,620
But

632
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,620
we should at least have a try.

633
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,540
Dad.

634
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,220
Dad.

635
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,510
You’re back.

636
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,470
Mr. He, nice to meet you.

637
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,110
You and your friend come here to play tug-of-war?

638
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,310
Where’s your other friend?

639
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,900
He...he...

640
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,260
He’s busy.

641
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,700
Sir,

642
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,340
this is a gift for you.

643
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,420
What is this?

644
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
It’s

645
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,020
the best Maojian tea.

646
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,060
Maojian?

647
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,580
For me?

648
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,540
Wow.

649
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,060
Thanks.

650
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
It’s good.

651
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,820
Dad,

652
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,660
we should

653
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,040
give him something in return, right?

654
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,660
He bought you the finest tea.

655
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,710
We should give him something, too.

656
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,700
Like what?

657
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,820
Pear Blossom is the best liquor we have.

658
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,220
Pear Blossom?

659
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,220
Pear...

660
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,540
No, no.

661
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,540
No way.

662
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,500
It's cursed.

663
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,620
What’re you up to?

664
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,300
Is this your idea?

665
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,060
I...

666
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,430
You cheated my daughter

667
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,140
to steal Pear Blossom?

668
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,820
Jerk!

669
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,940
- Dad.  - You’re evil.

670
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,900
- Mr. He, I...  - Dad.

671
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,180
- Pear Blossom.  - Dad.  - Mr. He.

672
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,460
No Pear Blossom.

673
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,380
Not at all.

674
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,300
Don’t have it.

675
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,020
No.
