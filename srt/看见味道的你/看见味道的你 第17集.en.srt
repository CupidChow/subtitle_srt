00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,520
Hi guys,

2
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,500
I’ve got the cards for you.

3
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,400
Mr. Wan,

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,520
we don’t have enough people to play.

5
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,759
Do you want to join the game?

6
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,080
Sure, what do you want to play?

7
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,759
Werewolves of Miller's Hollow

8
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,220
I only play Texas Hold’em.

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,880
I don’t know how to play that.

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,040
Me neither.

11
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,210
Don’t listen to her.

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,000
Werewolves of Miller's Hollow, it is!

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,880
Alright!

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
The guests used to ask me to be the Moderator.

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,280
No! No!

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,190
I’m not good at this game.

17
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,520
Let me be the Moderator.

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
That’s fine!

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,760
Okay!

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,079
Mu Chunfeng.

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,440
Wanna play Werewolves of Miller's Hollow with us?

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,079
Why not?

23
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,180
Miss Mi Ya, wanna play too?

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,560
Sure!

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,040
Take a seat!

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
I’m a good person.

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,640
I’m the Ordinary Townsfolk.

28
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
I’m the Werewolf.

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,760
I’m the Hunter.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,880
Whoever dares to touch me

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,940
will be taken away.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,240
I’m the Witch.

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,090
I’m an Ordinary Townsfolk.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,120
Me too.

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,480
I’m the God.

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
I’m the Werewolf.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,880
The sun rises.

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,160
Who died?

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,620
She was killed last night.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,680
Please state your will.

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600
Why me?

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,079
It’s the most boring game I’ve ever played!

43
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,620
Okay?

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,040
Alright.

45
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,160
Now, the one on the left side of the dead, please speak.

46
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,640
Why do you ignore me?

47
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,370
You are dead. Please stop talking.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
I’m the Fortune Teller.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,200
I investigated and hunted Lu Weixun last night.

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,760
Over.

51
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,520
I’m innocent. Over.

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
I’m innocent.

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,360
I’ll see who will call

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
the Fortune Teller again later.

55
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,360
Over.

56
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,770
I’m the Fortune Teller.

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,920
The real one.

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,880
I’ve checked last night that Lu Weixun is guilty.

59
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,400
Over.

60
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
Now we have two Fortune Tellers.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,120
I can’t quite figure out the situation yet.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,920
I want to hear more opinions.

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,040
Over.

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,920
I’m the real Fortune Teller.

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,440
I’m sorry

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,160
that I couldn’t identify the Werewolves last night.

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,020
I’m sure Mu Chunfeng is innocent.

68
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
As for Yi Nanke,

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,980
you must be a Werewolf.

70
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,080
I will point you out tonight.

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,680
And Miss He,

72
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,920
if you are innocent,

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,200
you’d better follow my lead.

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,680
About Mi Ya,

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,130
I’ll investigate her tonight.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
I hope the Witch would protect me.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,400
Thanks.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,300
First of all, I’m an Ordinary Townsfolk.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
But I think

80
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,920
what Mr. Lu said makes sense.

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,840
Over.

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay, speech time is over.

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,159
I’ll count down from three.

84
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,120
Then we vote.

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,159
Three,

86
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,400
two,

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,360
one.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,460
I abstain from voting.

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,040
Okay.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,930
Yi Nanke is eliminated.

91
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,960
Any will?

92
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
No.

93
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Let’s continue.

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,130
Night falls. All players close your eyes.

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Werewolves, please open your eyes.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,400
Now, choose your target.

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,040
Please reach an agreement.

98
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,700
Werewolves, please close your eyes.

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,160
The sun rises.

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
Let’s vote.

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,860
I’ll start counting down.

102
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,440
Three,

103
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,160
two,

104
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,880
one.

105
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,930
He Buzui is eliminated.

106
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,210
Werewolves won.

107
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,360
That’s what I thought! Werewolves won.

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,080
You took my identity right from the beginning!

109
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,159
How come you two…

110
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,159
He must be the Fortune Teller.

111
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,960
Your speech was illogical.

112
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,440
If you thought Yi Nanke was the Witch,

113
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
you wouldn’t have been fooled

114
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,520
by Mr. Mu’s speech.

115
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
I don’t believe you.

116
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,640
What’s wrong with her?

117
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,100
Weixun, don’t talk to her!

118
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,120
Bai Jing.

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,920
Could you stay out of my business?

120
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,960
What did I do?

121
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
So, keep playing?

122
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,260
We don’t have enough people now.

123
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,720
A game turned into a fight.

124
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,120
Let’s go.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,400
Is it for me?

126
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,600
So,

127
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,050
why did we play Werewolves of Miller's Hollow today?

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,960
No reason! Everybody was bored.

129
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,760
Wan Zeze was apparently an Ordinary Townsfolk,

130
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,120
yet Lu Weixun didn’t choose him to kill.

131
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,320
It doesn’t make sense.

132
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,980
He wasn’t seriously playing.

133
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,420
Mu Chunfeng was Werewolf too.

134
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,760
He didn’t choose Wan Zeze either.

135
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Mu Chunfeng wouldn’t

136
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,960
compete with Lu Weixun in a game!

137
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,280
Otherwise, Wan Ze…

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,080
What?

139
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,850
You know him quite well!

140
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,360
My god!

141
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,050
You are so competitive.

142
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,400
I’m not.

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
You know,

144
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,880
the stubbornness

145
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
doesn’t make you cute at all.

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,120
Cute?

147
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,200
Me?

148
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Sometimes.

149
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,180
Cheers.

150
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,080
Let’s go.

151
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,160
No.

152
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,620
I’m depressed about losing the game.

153
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
You care too much.

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,120
You set me a trap.

155
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
Alright,

156
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
I’ll let you win next round.

157
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Let’s go.

158
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,050
Don’t think I didn’t see it.

159
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,920
It wasn’t because you were bored

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
so you guys wanted to play cards all of a sudden.

161
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,280
Since you know,

162
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,080
then why are you still angry?

163
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Why didn’t you tell me

164
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,020
that you guys wanted to test Wan Zeze?

165
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,909
You are such a smarty.

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
But you guessed it anyway

167
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,820
even though I didn’t tell.

168
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,000
But it

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,240
feels different!

170
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Alright!

171
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,920
I won’t keep anything from you in the future.

172
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,600
Okay?

173
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,040
Promise?

174
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,760
When did I ever lie to you?

175
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,880
Come on.

176
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,160
Are you okay?

177
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
Sprained your ankle?

178
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,280
It’s all your fault!

179
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,360
If you didn’t pull me,

180
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,820
I wouldn’t have got hurt jumping off myself.

181
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Okay!

182
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,440
It’s my fault.

183
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,720
Don’t hold me up!

184
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,520
I can walk myself!

185
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,480
Put me down!

186
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,160
I can walk!

187
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,040
You really put me down, huh?

188
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
Haven’t you any principle?

189
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,760
You are just being troublesome!

190
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,360
I’ve never seen any girl as lively as you

191
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,820
when spraining her ankle!

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,660
Don’t move.

193
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,120
- Don’t…  - Don’t move!

194
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,400
Put me down.

195
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,040
Put me down, now!

196
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,440
I can walk!

197
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
There are so many people here!

198
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,480
Put me down, now!

199
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,280
Now!

200
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,400
What’s wrong?

201
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,720
She fell.

202
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,640
Fell?

203
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,800
I’m fine.

204
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
Just sprained my ankle.

205
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,640
Which foot?

206
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,600
Make me sick!

207
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Lu Weixun.

208
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,890
I’ll go get some ice.

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,000
Wait a sec.

210
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,360
So careless!

211
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,080
Tell me.

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Did you run out of the room

213
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,000
and sprain your ankle on purpose

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,540
so that Weixun

215
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,860
could carry you back.

216
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
Could you stop?

217
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,580
My foot is really hurting.

218
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,160
I only want to rest now.

219
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,240
You feel guilty.

220
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,340
Otherwise, why don’t you dare look at me in the eye?

221
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,540
Miss Bai.

222
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,920
Everything will go as you wish.

223
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,400
Can I rest now?

224
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,720
No!

225
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,040
Let me tell you.

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,920
I’ve witnessed every important occasion

227
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,400
that Lu Weixun has experienced in his life so far.

228
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,060
Like when his mom passed away,

229
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,360
when he fought with Mr. Lu

230
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,090
because of the three wineries.

231
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,320
when he left home and struggled to support himself.

232
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,600
I’ve witnessed them all!

233
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,200
But you,

234
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,920
you haven’t.

235
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,540
So he has been through a lot.

236
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,840
Of course.

237
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,890
You had no idea, hadn’t you?

238
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,360
But I know it all.

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,530
How did you think of Wan Zeze

240
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
during the game just now.

241
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,240
Skills are so-so.

242
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,960
Easy to be swayed.

243
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,250
He’s either super ignorant

244
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,040
or super sophisticated.

245
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,120
Hope he is just ignorant.

246
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,800
Mr. Wan.

247
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,280
What’s up?

248
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,000
It’s about looking for Pear Blossom tomorrow.

249
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,210
I can’t go tomorrow.

250
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,200
Why?

251
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,660
The road down the hill is under construction.

252
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,860
There’s no other way?

253
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,520
There is.

254
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,000
But not for cars.

255
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
I’m not strong enough to walk down.

256
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,920
And I need to make a new wine set.

257
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
If you don’t mind,

258
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,020
I’ll take you to the winery next time.

259
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Mr. Wan.

260
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,240
Could you give us the address?

261
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,530
We can go ourselves.

262
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,360
The winery is not allowed visitors.

263
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,520
If I don’t take you there,

264
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
they won’t let you in.

265
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,840
Mr. Wan.

266
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
If nothing works,

267
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,440
we’ll just find it by ourselves.

268
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,000
What if we get lost?

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,680
We can’t go.

270
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,800
Why?

271
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
I just asked Wan Zeze.

272
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,000
He said it doesn’t allow visitors

273
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,520
unless he takes us.

274
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,120
Then let him take us there.

275
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,920
He doesn’t have time.

276
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,690
He’s going to design a wine set.

277
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,360
The other way

278
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
is not suitable for driving.

279
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,480
He’s not well.

280
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,010
We can’t force him to go.

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,440
So it means we can’t go anywhere

282
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,520
until he finishes the wine set

283
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,920
and the road is repaired.

284
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,120
That’s right.

285
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,770
It’d take at least three days for the road to be ready.

286
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,720
Then how long does he need to design the wine set?

287
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,780
He doesn’t seem to have any inspiration at this moment.

288
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,400
Is he stalling on purpose?

289
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,960
Why are you questioning him?

290
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
I heard he told the winery to get prepared

291
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,840
during the day.

292
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,280
But he seemed like a nice guy

293
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,560
during the game.

294
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,800
Anyway,

295
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,480
we need to ask him to help us

296
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,610
find Pear Blossom as soon as possible.

297
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,260
In case anything happens.

298
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,980
Then what should we do?

299
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,250
Come with me.

300
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,600
I need to talk to you.

301
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,360
Can you talk to her tomorrow?

302
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,360
Am I talking to you?

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,480
It’s ok.

304
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,860
I’ll go talk to him.

305
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,600
Bring the flowers to Miss Bai.

306
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
Shall I wait for you?

307
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,650
No, it’s fine. Go ahead.

308
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,440
Give me a can of beer.

309
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
I can’t open it.

310
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,280
You can’t?

311
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,980
Then I’ll ask others for help.

312
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,760
Willful.

313
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,040
Just admit that you are jealous.

314
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,720
Yes.

315
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
I am.

316
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,720
Of what?

317
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,160
Give me a reason.

318
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,160
I like you.

319
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,810
You’ve thought it over?

320
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,760
No.

321
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,960
So you are just saying,

322
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
and not going to make it official.

323
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,640
I’m sorry.

324
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,100
Yi Nanke, what kind of a fool

325
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
are you taking me for?

326
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,560
Here are your flowers.

327
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
You scared me!

328
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,440
Be quiet.

329
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,200
They’ll be back soon!

330
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,720
Mu Chunfeng.

331
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,140
Why are you doing this?

332
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,520
- Beautiful flowers for beautiful girl.  - Put me down!

333
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,560
- Put me down!  - I just picked them.

334
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Hope you’ll like.

335
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Thank you!

336
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,320
They are so pretty! I like a lot!

337
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
He’s trying to date her! Let’s get out of here.

338
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
Weixun, don’t be mad.

339
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,100
He just wants to give me some flowers.

340
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,250
I’m not jealous.

341
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,690
Please continue. Sorry to interrupt.

342
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,200
Weixun!

343
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
Why did you hold her in your arms just now?

344
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,760
Her ankle got hurt.

345
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,560
So? She can still walk!

346
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,220
I’m worried about her!

347
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,960
It’s not what you think!

348
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,900
Do you want to throw the flowers away?

349
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,740
No, I’ll bring them back!

350
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,840
Weixun must get angry with me.

351
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,160
So he did that on purpose to make me jealous.

352
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
Lu Weixun should be in your room right now

353
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,960
taking care of He Buzui.

354
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,520
Are you sure you want to go there?

355
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,680
Of course.

356
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,770
You come with me.

357
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,000
I just took her back.

358
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I’m leaving. Bye!

359
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,440
Weixun.

360
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,760
I forget where I put my flower pot.

361
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,000
Did you see it?

362
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,480
Isn’t this your room?

363
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,410
I don’t know where it is.

364
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,520
Since we can’t leave here for a couple of days,

365
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,040
just stay in your room

366
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,340
and get recovered.

367
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,650
I’m leaving.

368
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,600
Miss Bai.

369
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,040
Are you done yet?

370
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,660
You are not even my friend.

371
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,480
Plus,

372
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,240
you crossed the line!

373
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,400
You crossed the line first!

374
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,600
I didn’t!

375
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,000
You know that Weixun is my fiance

376
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
Why are you into him?

377
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,720
I’m into him?

378
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
The way you look at him

379
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,760
is filled with love!

380
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,080
Really?

381
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,600
I thought

382
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,320
I’m just used to it

383
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,180
after working with him this long.

384
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,440
I know Weixun is outstanding.

385
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,080
A lot of girls are into him.

386
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,780
But he never looked at any of them.

387
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,560
You are his assistant,

388
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,080
so you might think it’s handier for you to go after him.

389
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,810
You’d better

390
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,940
stay away from him.

391
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,080
Just leave him alone.

392
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,880
Do you hear me?

393
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,080
If you don’t stop,

394
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,400
I’ll make you realize how much you really mean to him.

395
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,080
He only has me in his heart,

396
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,320
not you!

397
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,320
Got it?

398
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,450
Did you sit here all night long?

399
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,480
What are you doing?

400
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,800
I don’t know.

401
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,320
I’ve got too much on my mind.

402
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,440
Tell me.

403
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,080
What can I help?

404
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,120
You.

405
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,880
You are my biggest worry.

406
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I’m sorry.

407
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,760
It’s alright.

408
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,560
Aside from me,

409
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,880
what else is bothering you?

410
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,160
Wan Zeze won’t take us to find Pear Blossom.

411
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,160
I think he’s stalling.

412
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,900
My dad and the wine recipe disappeared at the same time.

413
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,400
And now, Pear Blossom appears on the market again.

414
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
It’s too messy.

415
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,210
There are too many question marks.

416
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,880
You think they are hiding the truth from you?

417
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,900
I always believe that my dad was wronged.

418
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
The thought

419
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,280
makes me even more restless.

420
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,080
Think about it,

421
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,560
it’s been so many years.

422
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,100
So many things happened throughout the years.

423
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,030
There’s nothing we can do but wait.

424
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,280
Actually, if you can be more patient,

425
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,980
it won’t make any difference waiting a few days longer.

426
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,840
And,

427
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,040
you can talk to me,

428
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,240
I will…

429
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Weixun,

430
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,170
will you take a walk outside with me today?

431
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
I don’t have time.

432
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,740
I need to take care of He Buzui.

433
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,440
I’m your fiancée.

434
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,370
Why do you always treat me this way?

435
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,290
Bai Jing.

436
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
I’ve never acknowledged

437
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,000
the so-called marriage arrangement between us.

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
But you always ignore my words.

439
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,440
In that case,

440
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,600
I’ll tell you seriously again,

441
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,840
I’m not your fiancé or boyfriend.

442
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,040
The friendship between our families also make us friends,

443
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,100
and you were my classmate at WSA.

444
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,000
That’s it.

445
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,200
Why do you talk to me this way today?

446
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
Because I’ve already had someone in my heart.

447
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,600
I don’t want her to misunderstand.

448
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Then are you sure she likes you too?

449
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,440
I’m not sure if she likes me.

450
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,400
But I know

451
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
falling in love

452
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
is a beautiful journey.

453
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,490
The result is not as important.

454
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,840
Weixun, are you not feeling well today?

455
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,920
You weren’t like this before.

456
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,480
Have I ever responded to you

457
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
while you thought I was your fiancé?

458
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,290
I don’t care.

459
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,540
It doesn’t matter.

460
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,740
The important thing is

461
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
that we’ll get married eventually.

462
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,400
Sorry.

463
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,000
I can’t let you live in your dreams anymore.

464
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,160
Lu Weixun.

465
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,920
Since I’ve chosen you,

466
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,320
I won’t give up easily!

467
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,100
Okay,

468
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,560
I’ll give you some time to think.

469
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Come to find me

470
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,900
when you think it through.

471
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,010
Let me give you a massage when I’m free.

472
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,880
- Mr. Wan.  - Mr. Wan.

473
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,880
Looks like

474
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,020
you didn’t sleep well last night.

475
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,960
This is my wine set design studio.

476
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
I stayed up all night but still didn’t have any inspiration.

477
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,320
May I ask

478
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,520
what kind of wine set?

479
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,920
Maybe we can give you some ideas.

480
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,780
It’s a wine holder for white wine.

481
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,780
The theme is The Drop of Fine Wine.

482
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,880
The design should focus on the status of dropping.

483
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,600
But the samples I’ve made so far

484
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,260
didn’t quite match the theme.

485
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,760
I’m so stuck.

486
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,440
If you don’t mind,

487
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,800
maybe we can take a look

488
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,240
and let’s brainstorm a little bit.

489
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,520
I think it’s a good idea.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,460
sorry for the trouble then

491
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,130
Why are you calling me here?

492
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,600
Leave Lu Weixun.

493
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
So dramatic.

494
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,120
Are you going to say if his mom was alive…

495
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,040
That’s right!

496
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,800
If Mrs. Lu was alive,

497
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,530
she would ask you to do the same.

498
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,280
Alright then.

499
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,280
Give me.

500
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,480
What?

501
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,240
Money, of course!

502
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,960
So I am right!

503
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,690
You are that type of person!

504
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,600
You don’t deserve him at all!

505
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,440
Miss Bai, you are so smart!

506
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
So, hurry!

507
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,520
Okay!

508
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,570
How much do you want?

509
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,520
Let me count the zeros…

510
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Miss Bai,

511
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,640
you have so much money.

512
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,560
You decide.

513
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,400
Alright.

514
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,640
Take the money,

515
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,440
and get out of here!

516
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,260
What are you doing?

517
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,690
Why are you writing a check?

518
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,200
I just want you to know

519
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,500
what kind of person she really is!

520
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,360
What is more important to her, money or you?

521
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,530
Will you take the money?

522
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,680
Sure!

523
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,000
Now you see the real her!

524
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,320
Take the money, and go away!

525
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,960
Miss Bai,

526
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,280
I’ve signed a contract with him.

527
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,200
Do we have a contract?

528
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
What do you mean?

529
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,280
I’ll take the money.

530
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,400
You can go now.

531
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,080
How shameless are you?

532
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,040
I paid you to get you out of here!

533
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,600
In a commercial society, we should respect the spirit of contract.

534
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,520
An ignorant girl like you

535
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,440
will get fooled easily.

536
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,560
You were making fun of me?

537
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,120
Will you really take the money?

538
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,840
I just wanted to bug her.

539
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,120
Take it, it’s your tip!

540
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,360
What are you doing?

541
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,130
I think you are cute!

542
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,480
Because I gave you money?

543
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,000
Is your ankle still hurt?

544
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,000
No.

545
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,160
See, I can jump now.

546
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,160
Let’s go!

547
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,540
Come on!

548
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,820
What are you doing?

549
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,440
You want to throw me on the ground again, don’t you?

550
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,200
I can’t adapt to the local climate.

551
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,600
My body feels sore.

552
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,920
Very uncomfortable.

553
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,600
Because you are old!

554
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,560
You’ve got a lot of health problems.

555
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,400
Old?

556
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,560
Sit down.

557
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,420
Now, let me give you a massage.

558
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,730
You know how to massage?

559
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,280
I know a lot of things.

560
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,280
Be gentle.

561
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,240
You are quite strong.

562
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,360
Over here, over here.

563
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,360
Not bad!

564
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,680
Nice!

565
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,120
Would you massage my leg too?

566
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,520
Don’t push it!

567
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,800
Get down.

568
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,400
Thank you!

569
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,280
For the massage?

570
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,240
No,

571
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,160
for your trust over this time.

572
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,020
Thank you for trusting me.

573
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,580
How do you know I trust you?

574
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
The things we are doing here

575
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,970
have nothing to do with you.

576
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,700
But you are still here to help.

577
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,410
I’m helping you.

578
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,850
If nothing happens,

579
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,580
I’ll at most be disappointed.

580
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,580
But if I don’t help,

581
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,760
I’ll regret it.

582
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,920
Come on,

583
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
it’s my turn to serve you.

584
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,360
Let me see what you can do.

585
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
Can you be gentle?

586
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,320
Be gentle.

587
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,780
The magazine is a tough industry now.

588
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,840
Everybody relies on their cell phones.

589
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,680
Mu Chunfeng.

590
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,040
Are you going for a walk?

591
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,970
I want to go, too!

592
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,120
Right!

593
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
We are going for a walk.

594
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,480
You must be Miss Bai from the WSA.

595
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,880
I’ve heard so much about you.

596
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,810
Nice to meet you.

597
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,930
Hope to work with you in the future.

598
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,920
Let’s go.

599
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
I’ve asked them to get ready.

600
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,520
Don’t worry, Mr. Wan.

601
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,730
I’m on my way to Xinsu right now.

602
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,460
I’ll have a quick check and then get back.

603
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,800
Okay.

604
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,930
It’s so beautiful here.

605
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,320
Be careful.

606
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,600
Thank you!

607
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,160
Why are you being so polite?

608
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,440
It just feels a little awkward

609
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,160
that you’ve been

610
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,080
taking care of me.

611
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,040
Maybe not awkward,

612
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,960
but a little weird.

613
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Weird?

614
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
Why?

615
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,520
I’m not sure.

616
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,440
I don’t know!

617
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,400
You messed up my hair!

618
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,010
I think it looks quite nice!

619
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,520
How would I know when I can’t see?

620
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,760
As long as I can!

621
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,440
You are being unreasonable!

622
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,040
Zeze.

623
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,040
Zhong.

624
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,190
Mr. Wan asked me to bring you some tonics.

625
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,230
Thanks, Zhong.

626
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
Are there many guests?

627
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,480
Can you handle it alone?

628
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,560
Do you need me to stay and help?

629
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,760
Not too many.

630
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,760
Just a few. And they are easy to get along with.

631
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,840
They all love wine.

632
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,080
All of them?

633
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,680
Yes.

634
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,920
So you must have treated them

635
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,560
with all the wine you have.

636
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,410
Do you need me to bring you more?

637
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,080
They like Pear Blossom.

638
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
I’ll take them to Mr. Yang’s winery for a visit

639
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,160
when the road is open.

640
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,080
Zhong.

641
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,760
The road is under construction. How did you get here?

642
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,040
I took a detour.

643
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Seems like the road won’t be open

644
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,800
until a few days later.

645
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,800
Call me

646
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,760
if you need anything.

647
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,520
I’ll bring it to you.

648
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,120
Okay!

649
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,520
If there’s nothing else,

650
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,380
I’ll leave now.

651
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,280
Okay!

652
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,160
Drive safely.

653
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,640
Okay!

654
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,880
Mr. Wan.

655
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,370
You're here?

656
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
Please take a look around.

657
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,080
I’ll be with you soon.

658
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,080
These are a few samples

659
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,040
I made last night.

660
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,500
But I don’t think they embody the theme well.

661
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,530
I think your design is quite creative.

662
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,560
I’m flattered.

663
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
I was not a well-child,

664
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,330
couldn’t run around and play like others.

665
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,760
So I spent most of my time playing clay in the corner.

666
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,420
Over time, it became my hobby.

667
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,920
Actually it’s a lucky thing

668
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,480
living on my hobby.

669
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,840
You must have had a serious illness when you were little.

670
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,280
You look fine now.

671
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,120
I had a heart disease.

672
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,920
I had to receive a surgery overseas.

673
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,160
If it wasn’t for my father’s boss,

674
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,850
we couldn’t have afforded that kind of money.

675
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,120
Please stay,

676
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,840
I’ll go wash my hands.

677
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,220
Buzui.

678
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,930
Look at this one.

679
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,860
It’s quite pretty.

680
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,840
It’s just a

681
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,600
exquisite bottle;

682
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
It doesn’t quite match

683
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,200
the theme he talked about.

684
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Look at this one.

685
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,080
This is not bad.

686
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,960
It really is…

687
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,520
Don’t touch it!

688
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:15,960
Oh no!

689
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,520
Do you guys have enough money

690
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,380
to compensate?

691
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,760
He’s back!

692
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,000
So sorry!

693
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,160
We didn’t help at all,

694
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,700
but ruined your design instead.

695
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,040
I’m sorry!

696
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,080
I didn’t know

697
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,480
it’d dent once I touched it.

698
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,200
How much? We’ll pay.

699
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
This is exactly the design I wanted!

700
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Thank you so much!

701
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
I’ll treat you dinner tonight.

702
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,800
Everybody.

703
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,120
Eat some.

704
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
I’m not fat.

705
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,240
Don’t call me fat!

706
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,900
You are not!

707
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,880
Don’t call Buzui fat.

708
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,810
Buzui is not fat.

709
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,250
Come on, have some more.

710
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,520
You guys too, more eating, less drinking.

711
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,280
Everybody,

712
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,620
please allow me to say something.

713
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,040
It’s

714
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,920
my pleasure

715
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,120
to invite all you guys

716
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,600
here today

717
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,210
to enjoy dinner with me.

718
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
I know it’s not the best dinner ever,

719
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,760
but

720
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,120
the wine

721
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,700
is all from my personal collection.

722
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,810
I don’t know if you can taste it.

723
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,890
But please feel at home,

724
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,200
and drink away.

725
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,640
Just enjoy!

726
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,360
Here, let’s have a toast!

727
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Okay! Cheers!

728
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,320
Come on! Cheers!

729
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,760
Mr. Wan.

730
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,160
Given that you are into Kun Opera

731
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,320
and antique-style decoration,

732
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,720
I thought you only drink spirits or millet wine.

733
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,000
I didn’t expect that you’d collect

734
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,520
so much red wine and Whiskey.

735
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,120
Mi Ya, you are wrong.

736
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,520
There’s no good or bad

737
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,880
in the type of wine.

738
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,180
The only difference is

739
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,040
which type suits you

740
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,520
better.

741
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,000
Just like there’s no good or bad

742
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,480
in the value of wine.

743
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,540
It doesn’t matter.

744
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,840
As long as you seriously make the wine,

745
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,040
it’ll all be worth putting it

746
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,800
into the beautiful wine set.

747
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,680
Right?

748
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,840
That’s right.

749
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,480
Take you guys for example,

750
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,160
no matter where you are from

751
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,840
and where you will be,

752
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,160
and no matter what you’ve been through,

753
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,450
since we are all here today,

754
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,610
it’s destiny brought us together.

755
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,000
So,

756
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,960
we’ll make friends via drinking today.

757
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,140
Come on!

758
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,480
Cheers!

759
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,080
Okay!

760
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,780
Cheers!

761
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,440
Friends! Cheers!

762
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,800
All of us! Cheers!

763
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,000
Cheers, friend!

764
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,240
Red wine.

765
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,080
I don’t like red wine.

766
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,440
Just try a little.

767
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
Have something mild.

768
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,280
Don’t eat too much.

769
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,000
Here.

770
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,080
Toast for our meeting.

771
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,600
Or, hope we won’t fight again

772
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,760
after drinking this.

773
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,080
The liquor has an agreeable sweetness.

774
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,160
Quite nice!

775
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,490
Turns out Mr. Wan is such a nice man,

776
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,560
and his wine collection is good too.

777
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,280
Let me take a picture of you when you drink.

778
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,880
Why?

779
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,080
Mr. Lu.

780
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,220
Cheers.

781
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,400
Me too!

782
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,490
Come on, Weixun.

783
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,280
Cheers!

784
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
You guys drink too much.

785
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,760
Let me.

786
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,840
What are you doing?

787
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,580
Everybody,

788
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,200
It’s my pleasure

789
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
to get together

790
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,240
with you guys.

791
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,360
Or it’s my luck

792
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,440
to meet you guys

793
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,960
in my life.

794
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,120
So, today,

795
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,220
let’s feel free to drink.

796
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,600
Toast for us!

797
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,240
Come on! Cheers!

798
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,320
Cheers!

799
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,240
Cheers!

800
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,720
Bai Jing, you are drunk!

801
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,880
Drunk.

802
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,400
Bai Jing.

803
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,680
- Let me lean on you.  - You are drunk!

804
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,360
- Let me lean on you for a while.  - Lie down.

805
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,920
Bai Jing.
