1
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,000
Lu Weixun.

2
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,320
I think…

3
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,300
Let’s talk about it tomorrow.

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,520
I think…

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,920
Since you have regained your sense of taste,

6
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,940
and you have won the competition,

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,979
how about we cancel the contract?

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,240
Okay.

9
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,360
I agree.

10
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Night is so long.

11
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,400
If I hold my gentleness,

12
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,840
Let tears off to find a way,

13
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,800
Will I feel better?

14
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,480
Dream is continuing.

15
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,920
Luckily, I have you stopping for a second.

16
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,400
I try hard to control my emotions.

17
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,960
Let the wind heal the surface wound.

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,360
Who could I speak to the words from my heart?

19
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,200
It’s only me in the room.

20
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,200
Sitting alone.

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,920
Keeping silence with smile.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,760
Pretending thoroughly but afraid of being found out.

23
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,680
It’ll be all right.

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,480
But tears become cheaper.

25
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,120
It cannot heal my scar any more.

26
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,160
Already been low to dust, I even won’t blossom.

27
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,320
I don’t expect someone to pick me.

28
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,000
Wasted time will eventually get scabby.

29
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,600
I won’t scream out my pain no matter how to touch it.

30
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,640
Will my love

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,440
Be in blossom beautifully?

32
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,820
I have finished my work.

33
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,720
Lu Weixun,

34
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,440
in my future life,

35
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,080
I won’t work around you anymore.

36
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,460
Congratulations.

37
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
You have paid off your debts of two million.

38
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,140
Congratulations to you, too.

39
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,159
I won’t be a burden to you any longer.

40
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,720
Although I have no taste,

41
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,520
my stomach tells me that

42
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,760
it’s good wine.

43
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
I’ll go upstairs and pack up.

44
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
It’s too late now.

45
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
Leave tomorrow.

46
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,650
Don’t run so fast. Do not run. Stop.

47
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
You bloke. Stop running.

48
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Brother-in-law.

49
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,970
Help me. Help me.

50
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,460
Where is he?

51
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
I don’t know.

52
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,580
Where is he?

53
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I don’t see.

54
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,560
You crap.

55
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,480
Find him. Go.

56
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Have you ever seen someone run over?

57
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,020
Don’t stand about. Chase him.

58
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Brother-in-law.

59
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
You are good to me.

60
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,880
For my sister’s sake,

61
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
please let me stay here.

62
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,120
But,

63
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
my sister is so tough.

64
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,720
It’s difficult for me to ask her for money.

65
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,120
You still can accept her.

66
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
You are so man.

67
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,800
Did you get your sister again?

68
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,330
No. No. No. I didn’t get her.

69
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,080
No.

70
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,159
I didn’t have enough time to get her

71
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,520
Didn’t have enough time.

72
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,920
No. No.

73
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,090
I’ll tell my sister.

74
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
You still dare to get her?

75
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,880
No. No.

76
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,080
I’m just kidding.

77
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
I won’t get her. Never.

78
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,680
Leave.

79
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,330
Then I’ll leave.

80
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,360
Thank you.

81
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,880
Why are you laughing?

82
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,730
So you didn’t let me touch the wine that day

83
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,650
is because it is for your younger brother?

84
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,660
What’s up?

85
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
Can’t I come if there is nothing?

86
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,480
Tomorrow is my birthday.

87
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,000
Will you

88
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,600
come together?

89
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,880
You’ve got so many friends.

90
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
It’s okay without me.

91
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
I just said I want to ask you out.

92
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,080
Mi Ya.

93
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,260
There’s something I have to tell you.

94
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,900
Now listen carefully.

95
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
I’m not a good man.

96
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
I can’t like you.

97
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,900
I have something important to do.

98
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,730
I have no way to fall in love.

99
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,360
It’s her pretending to be casual.

100
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,240
It sprouts after engraving in her heart.

101
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,200
The words a long time ago,

102
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,920
Are slowly enlarged in memory.

103
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,800
When promise meets silence,

104
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,360
What will happen?

105
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,410
Happy birthday.

106
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
All this time,

107
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,300
thank you for your endurance.

108
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,200
See you.

109
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,400
See you.

110
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,960
Does it mean never see you again?

111
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,960
Free now?

112
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,440
Yeah. Free.

113
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Without sadness?

114
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,360
We always need to look forward.

115
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,610
What are you going to do?

116
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,640
Maybe I should get a job first.

117
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,170
I have to earn my living.

118
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,240
How about

119
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,520
come to work in my bar?

120
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,240
Does it mean getting in by the backdoor?

121
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,400
Of course not.

122
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,330
I’m just recruiting today.

123
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,740
Working in my bar with your personality,

124
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,490
you must be able to attract a lot of guests.

125
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,680
Then okay.

126
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,570
Come on. Let me help you.

127
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,880
Come in.

128
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,080
You back?

129
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,560
How’s it going?

130
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,290
Are you enjoying your holiday?

131
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,240
It’s good.

132
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,040
Well.

133
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,080
Since you have a good holiday,

134
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,600
how about coming back for work.

135
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,200
By the way,

136
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,200
about the salary,

137
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,160
double it.

138
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,200
Why?

139
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,600
Why not?

140
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,360
I just want Mu Chunfeng

141
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
to be our consultant.

142
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,760
He is competent.

143
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,160
He lost the match with Lu Weixun,

144
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,400
but he has become famous.

145
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,530
Then he will have inestimable future.

146
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,920
Moreover,

147
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
I believe he is a person

148
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,740
knows better how to deal with people than Lu Weixun.

149
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
Why me?

150
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,130
Because he specified he wants you.

151
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,680
Just like me,

152
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,109
he has great belief in your competence.

153
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,920
He has read all of your articles.

154
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,619
No problem.

155
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,160
That’s great.

156
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,560
I wish you will have

157
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,020
successful cooperation.

158
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,109
What?

159
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
Chief Editor, Mr. Mu is here.

160
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,480
Come.

161
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,480
Is this the one?

162
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,920
Yes.

163
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,880
Mr. Mu.

164
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,340
I’m so sorry

165
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,880
to keep you waiting.

166
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,810
Nice to meet you.

167
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,920
Miss Mi Ya.

168
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,880
Nice to meet you again.

169
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,810
Nice to meet you.

170
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,930
I’ve already got the arrangement.

171
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,290
And I’ll be in charge of your articles.

172
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,800
Please point out for any problem.

173
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,730
You are too kind.

174
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,540
I’m the one needs your advice.

175
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,560
Mr. Mu.

176
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,640
Let’s not talk over here.

177
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,080
Mr. Mu.

178
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Please come to my office.

179
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,210
Please come with me.

180
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,080
Come on, Mi Ya.

181
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,280
Mr. Mu.

182
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,580
Please come in.

183
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,080
It’s in a bad condition.

184
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,080
Yeah.

185
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,840
Because of improper management,

186
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,640
we’ve been in deficit for years.

187
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,610
If it keeps going like this,

188
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,440
I’m afraid we cannot continue the business of Rose Winery any longer.

189
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,170
We must continue no matter how.

190
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,880
Mr. Ma.

191
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,740
Let me taste the new wine.

192
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,240
Okay.

193
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Fruity taste combined with oak barrel harmoniously.

194
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,920
Full-bodied.

195
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,040
Great structure.

196
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Soft tannins.

197
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,140
Moderate acidity.

198
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,680
And good standing of many years.

199
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,520
This is a good wine.

200
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,300
What’s the current price?

201
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,000
Over 600 for one.

202
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,570
With this kind of presence,

203
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,680
the price for the wine is not high.

204
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,520
Come on.

205
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,320
Have a taste.

206
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Good flavor in the last ten minutes.

207
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,840
Taste good?

208
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,400
Cheap gratification.

209
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,760
It’s called cheap and handy taste.

210
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,380
Good flavor for ordinary people.

211
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,240
Sense of taste will enable you experience the flavor in food.

212
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,600
But the gratification

213
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
comes from the stomach.

214
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,980
When you feel warm in stomach,

215
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,880
you feel things not that bad.

216
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,440
Both the wine and the price are all right.

217
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,500
It’s just because of the strategies.

218
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,440
Rose Winery did business of high-end wine before.

219
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,040
But in domestic market,

220
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,500
it’s lack of recognition for high-end wine.

221
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,060
We need to get profits.

222
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
In a short period,

223
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,200
we have no way to change the tune of consumers,

224
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,930
but only find a way from our own.

225
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,680
High-end wine is the feature of Rose Winery.

226
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,920
Remain it.

227
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,020
But decrease production.

228
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,900
Increase production of fair price wine.

229
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
Okay. Got it.

230
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,240
You’d believe that you will turn the corner.

231
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,480
Man will conquer nature.

232
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,040
Mr. Mu.

233
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,560
I will put all that we’ve talked over today

234
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,200
in the contract.

235
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,760
Okay.

236
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,880
I’ve got something to do later.

237
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,120
It’s time to say goodbye.

238
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,680
Mi Ya.

239
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,860
Please help me send Mr. Mu off.

240
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,720
Mr. Mu.

241
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,800
See you next time

242
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,280
See you.

243
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,000
Mr. Mu. This way, please.

244
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,600
Miss Mi Ya,

245
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,770
how about let me buy you a drink?

246
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,560
Okay.

247
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,480
Find a bar near your home.

248
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,200
It’ll be easy for you to get back.

249
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,130
Thank you for your consideration.

250
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,170
- Welcome to come again - Thank you.

251
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,400
Miss.

252
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,320
Coming.

253
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,720
Two bottles of Corona, please.

254
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,520
Okay.

255
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,980
Two bottles of Corona.

256
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,300
Environment here is good.

257
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,820
- Here you are. - Thank you.

258
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,320
So happy today.

259
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,320
I’ve told you

260
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,080
this job suits me.

261
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,280
I’m glad

262
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,530
to see you are happy.

263
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,680
Mi Ya.

264
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,360
Mi Ya. Here you come.

265
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,520
What would you like to drink?

266
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,720
You look good.

267
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,930
Are you the assistant of Lu Weixun?

268
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
Why are you working here?

269
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,860
His things have nothing to do with me.

270
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,290
A glass of John Collins.

271
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,280
Two.

272
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,720
Okay. Right now.

273
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,600
Tell me

274
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,880
why you asked me

275
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,680
to be your editor.

276
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,920
Because of your competence.

277
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,160
But I don’t have many contacts with you.

278
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,080
But you do have many contacts with Lu Weixun.

279
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,080
Two glasses of John Collins.

280
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,040
Two of the same.

281
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,160
Congenially.

282
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,520
But it seems the two are not congenial.

283
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,640
Do you think Mi Ya likes Mu Chunfeng?

284
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,160
What’s wrong,

285
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,490
By accident.

286
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
I would like to know the reason why Lu Weixun

287
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,240
could improve so fast in a short period.

288
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,520
If this is the reason

289
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,920
why we are here today,

290
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,830
I’m afraid I would let you down.

291
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,580
After Lu Weixun lost to you last time,

292
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,640
I’ve been off for vacation.

293
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,240
I didn’t contact him in the period.

294
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,480
About what happened to him these days,

295
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,700
I also have no idea.

296
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,240
With his personality,

297
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
no matter what happened to him,

298
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,080
it’s all because of his competence.

299
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,880
It seems

300
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,640
you really acknowledged

301
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,520
his personality.

302
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,200
Lu Weixun isn’t easy to get on with.

303
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,450
But he is a man of integrity.

304
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,600
I have no idea whether he is a man of integrity or not.

305
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,160
But I’m sure you are.

306
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,960
Cooperating with such kind of person, you are the first one

307
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,160
who still praise him.

308
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
I’m more certain

309
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,980
it’s right to cooperate with you.

310
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,080
Buzui.

311
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,830
Here you are.

312
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,300
Let me do it.

313
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
I can share you a piece of news.

314
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,920
It can prove that

315
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
Lu Weixun is not as just as you think.

316
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,680
So tell me.

317
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
The Rose Winery he won

318
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,920
is not his first winery.

319
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,420
How do you know?

320
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,860
Only knowing him well,

321
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
I’ll have the nerve to compete with him.

322
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,040
Once the news is spread around,

323
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,120
Lu Weixun…

324
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,840
Here you are.

325
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,960
We’ve got the boss here.

326
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,600
Is it because of my face

327
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,000
or Miss Mi Ya’s?

328
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,140
It’s surely yours.

329
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,060
You have a very good taste.

330
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,970
What you ordered is the classic of our bar.

331
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,280
I believe Miss Mi Ya’s taste.

332
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,360
Let bygones be bygones.

333
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Don’t mention it.

334
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,120
The wine is composed of

335
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,800
Cabernet Sauvignon of 85%,

336
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,560
Merlot of 10%,

337
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,520
and Chardonnay of 5%.

338
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,400
Mr. Lu.

339
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
Something was wrong.

340
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,400
We’ve got the news that

341
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,100
Lu Weixun operated the Muunas Winery in the shadows

342
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,600
when he was holding the post of sommelier.

343
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,480
He was challenging the fair rules of the wine commenting circle.

344
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,210
Is that true?

345
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,040
I cannot answer your questions.

346
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,760
May I ask whether Lu Weixun refuse to turn out

347
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,640
is because he is too ashamed to face

348
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,920
his peers in the wine industry?

349
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,440
Sorry. There is no way to tell.

350
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,240
I’ve heard that

351
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,340
Lu Weixun was removed from WSA.

352
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,440
He may have a crisis of confidence

353
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
in his career.

354
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,240
Is Lu Weixun hiding in the winery

355
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,080
because he can’t face the public?

356
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,440
Sorry.

357
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,100
I can’t answer this question.

358
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,840
Sorry. I can’t answer your questions.

359
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,440
Excuse me.

360
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,360
Mr. Lu.

361
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,340
What if the suppliers ask?

362
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,480
Tell them the truth.

363
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
Ask for forgiveness.

364
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,540
And respect their decisions.

365
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,960
Okay. Got it.

366
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,880
The genius Lu Weixun who won Mu Chunfeng

367
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,160
as the overwhelming favorite

368
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,920
has been getting caught up in a huge scandal.

369
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,480
It’s reported that

370
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,600
Lu Weixun already bought the famous

371
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,360
Muunas Winery with full fund

372
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
before getting into the industry as a sommelier,

373
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,120
and became the real owner of the winery.

374
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,780
At present,

375
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,840
there is no direct evidence

376
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,480
that can prove Lu Weixun profit from Muunas Winery

377
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,840
as a sommelier.

378
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,520
But the matter that he has sold the new wine for Muunas Winery

379
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,080
in the column of Dr'Wine

380
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,960
is proved to be true.

381
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
Hello. This is Dr'Wine.

382
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,920
Sorry.

383
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,720
About what you said,

384
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,880
we are also not very clear.

385
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,440
Sorry.

386
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,920
We are not responsible for Mr. Lu’s articles.

387
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,000
So we also have no idea.

388
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,760
Sorry.

389
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,600
Hello.

390
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,440
Thank you.

391
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,240
If there will be still such kind of calls,

392
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,400
answer like this.

393
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,600
Okay.

394
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,800
But Mr. Lu is…

395
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,880
He gets us into trouble even the contract has been cancelled.

396
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
Maybe he is a real master.

397
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,400
Mr. Mu.

398
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,320
Do you want to tell me something?

399
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,280
What?

400
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,450
Is it really not you?

401
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,050
I’m not a man who cannot afford to lose.

402
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,440
Chief Editor asks us to have a meeting.

403
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,280
Get it ready.

404
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,730
Then I’ll be off.

405
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,490
Chief Editor asks Mr. Mu too

406
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,600
According to industry analysis,

407
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Lu Weixun’s behavior

408
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,240
has seriously offended the industry convention.

409
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,300
So he will surely be removed from WSA.

410
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,440
About the additional punishment,

411
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,320
it depends on the follow-up investigations.

412
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,080
The event continues,

413
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,440
but the chain reactions have already appeared.

414
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,640
Sales for Muunas Winery stagnate.

415
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,520
The public trust of Dr'Wine in the industry

416
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,760
has suffered severe impact.

417
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,240
Some people boldly speculate that

418
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,280
Dr'Wine might be

419
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,890
a key segment on the profit chain of Lu Weixun.

420
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,840
Let’s have a discussion.

421
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,280
Change the cover story

422
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,400
into the exclusive interview on Mu Chunfeng after competition.

423
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,720
Deny we have something to do with

424
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
Lu Weixun and Muunas Winery.

425
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,690
Emphasize that we are also the victim.

426
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,400
Make a statement at the same time.

427
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
Hold Lu Weixun accountable.

428
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,360
Lodge a claim with him on the right of reputation.

429
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,960
Youyou.

430
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,240
Consult the legal about the compensation amount.

431
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,760
Okay.

432
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,120
I remember there was an article on Lu Weixun in some column.

433
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,720
It was about the barrel No. 92 of Muunas Winery.

434
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,080
Mi Ya changed it from a traits

435
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,480
into an interview.

436
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
If the reporters insist,

437
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,020
it will be the irrefutable evidence.

438
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,360
Mi Ya.

439
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,360
What’s your opinion?

440
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,640
I’ve heard that Mr. Lu

441
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,960
asked not to change a word in his drafts.

442
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,880
I believe that Miss Mi Ya is innocent.

443
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,680
In this case,

444
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,160
we can have the connecting records

445
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,120
of Mi Ya and Lu Weixun disclosed.

446
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,280
It is to prove that

447
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,680
Lu Weixun always asked not to change a word,

448
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
but to avoid a blank in the magazine,

449
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,480
the editor has no choice

450
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
but to change the traits into an interview.

451
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,520
Okay.

452
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,220
Do what Mr. Mu said.

453
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,360
Wait a minute.

454
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,450
Meeting is over.

455
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,560
Mr. Lu.

456
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,520
Mi Ya didn’t intentionally change your article.

457
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,640
It’s truly a small mistake.

458
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,160
Mistake is mistake.

459
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,330
It’s not about big or small.

460
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,040
I only hope my articles published in your magazine

461
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,450
won’t have any mistake.

462
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,370
Perfect is not my requirement,

463
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,960
but my standard.

464
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,880
You’ve made such kind of mistake this time. It’s not only about the attitude,

465
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,200
but also about the capability.

466
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,160
I will reconsider the contract with you.

467
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,200
- We are really sorry, Mr. Lu.  - I’m sorry.

468
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,080
It’s my fault.

469
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,920
Please give me another chance.

470
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,760
No next time.

471
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,960
Right, no next time.

472
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,000
I will try my best to help you.

473
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,800
I don’t need your help.

474
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,000
Only if you don’t make trouble.

475
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,480
Beidao.

476
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,600
Actually, we don’t need to

477
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,930
come to such kind of nice place for dinner.

478
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,000
You have worked so hard in my bar.

479
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,330
You even refused the bonus.

480
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,440
It’s all right to treat you a meal.

481
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,400
In fact,

482
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,240
I won’t know it’s delicious or not.

483
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,320
Your sense of taste has returned, right?

484
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,640
Lost again.

485
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,840
It seems that I will lose it completely from now on.

486
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,880
It appears that

487
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,890
my condition repeats all the time.

488
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,840
Oh my God.

489
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,890
It’s unfair.

490
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,680
It’s been years.

491
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,280
I’ve already been used to it.

492
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,160
It’s fine.

493
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,280
Thank you.

494
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,920
Wagyu Beef of 5-A level.

495
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,490
It’s worthy of waiting.

496
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,850
Double. Charbroiling.

497
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Wagyu Beef

498
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,840
of top degree of frosty

499
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,000
with the mouth melting taste.

500
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,050
Choose blend mainly mixed with Cabernet Sauvignon.

501
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,410
It’s the most favorite.

502
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,760
Muunas dome dry red wine, please.

503
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,360
Sorry, miss.

504
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,640
All wine from Muunas Winery

505
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,400
are off the shelves.

506
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,480
Off?

507
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,760
Why?

508
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,850
It’s said that’s because of the sommelier Lu Weixun.

509
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,440
Sake, please.

510
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,560
Okay. Sir.

511
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,080
It’s getting cooler recently.

512
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,720
Put on more clothes.

513
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,450
Be careful. Don’t catch a cold.

514
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,600
Yeah.

515
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,160
It’s getting cooler recently.

516
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,690
Right. Put on more clothes.

517
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,860
You still cannot get over from Lu Weixun.

518
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,920
No.

519
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,040
I just…

520
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,880
After all, he helped me to pay the debt.

521
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,560
I always think that I owe him.

522
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,960
You make the money with your own labour.

523
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,320
It’s a fair transaction.

524
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,440
You don’t owe him.

525
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,480
It’s unexpected that

526
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,840
he is in trouble

527
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,710
just after my leave.

528
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,790
It has nothing to do with you.

529
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,920
We have worked together before.

530
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,190
Moreover, he is not that bad.

531
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,400
Do you remember how he treated me?

532
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,670
Do you remember how rude, overbearing and self-righteous he was?

533
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,360
Beidao.

534
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,630
What’s wrong?

535
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Sorry.

536
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,380
I’m just caring about you.

537
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,530
Did you hear that

538
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,360
Lu Weixun’s character has been destroyed.

539
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
He can’t stage a comeback this time.

540
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,240
It’s all about him. I’d know it.

541
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,080
Terrible for Lu Weixun.

542
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,200
Reporters stay all day near his house recently.

543
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,880
He is even afraid to go outside.

544
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,320
No wine can be sold.

545
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
About his winery,

546
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,720
I think it’ll almost go out of business.

547
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,440
I’ve heard that he would like to borrow money,

548
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,700
but nobody helped him.

549
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,240
He is ruined this time.

550
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,760
I know this.

551
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,400
Lu Weixun is a bad person.

552
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,680
He has got used to being rude.

553
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,700
Now he even doesn’t have a friend.

554
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,480
You know?

555
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,160
All those who contacted him before

556
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,680
hate him very much.

557
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,360
Right.

558
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,570
You know what. My friend even said that

559
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,480
Lu Weixun was dead in his house

560
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,980
for one month before he was found.

561
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,360
Such a gossip.

562
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
I’m his friend.

563
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,680
Beidao.

564
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,200
I have things to do. I gotta go.

565
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,980
Thank you for treating me.

566
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,640
I will treat you next time.

567
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,440
Who is she?

568
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,120
I don’t know.

569
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,480
Xia Fan.

570
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Quick. Go to Lu Weixun’s door. Wait for me.

571
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,780
It’s too difficult to get some news of Lu Weixun.

572
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,840
You are right.

573
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,520
Nowhere to start.

574
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,160
Buzui.

575
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,020
Please take me a lemon.

576
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,960
Okay.

577
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,770
Here you are.

578
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,680
Free to eat.

579
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,240
Thank you. Thank you.

580
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,080
Are you reporters?

581
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,840
Reporters with no news.

582
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
I’ve heard you mentioned Lu Weixun.

583
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,480
Some customers mentioned that

584
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,440
Rose Winery Lu Weixun won

585
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,200
was not his first winery.

586
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,660
How do you know?

587
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,100
Only knowing him well,

588
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,220
I’ll have the nerve to compete with him.

589
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,080
I don’t know whether it’s true or not.

590
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
You need to check and verify.

591
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Sir. Pay the bill.

592
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,060
Why didn’t you tell me such a big deal?

593
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,660
By heaven and hell,

594
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,460
it’s you who said to cancel the contract.

595
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,320
I thought you’ve made a clean break

596
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,480
and never been in contact with each other.

597
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,440
Even though we are not cooperating,

598
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,080
I can’t just look on his matters without taking any action.

599
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,000
Who am I?

600
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,760
I’m a superwoman who robs the rich and relieves the poor.

601
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,640
I’ll kill the devils.

602
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,520
Even if you are really a superwoman,

603
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,580
you can’t help him.

604
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,060
It’s a stalemate now and can’t remedy it.

605
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,120
Jinx.

606
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,340
Knock the door.

607
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,840
Me?

608
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,040
Yes.

609
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,520
Why don’t you?

610
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,520
Will he open it if I knock the door?

611
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
Will he?

612
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,680
Idol. Please open the door.

613
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,320
I know there were plenty of verbal attacks on you recently.

614
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,650
I have argued with them.

615
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,120
Open the door.

616
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,280
Keep knocking.

617
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,720
He won’t open it.

618
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,700
I know he is in, but why doesn’t he open the door?

619
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,600
So many people are waiting to see what a fool he is.

620
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,840
How could he appear?

621
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,040
Will he take it too hard?

622
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,440
He is at home. What could he do?

623
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,320
Unless…

624
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,490
Find a way quickly. Life is between hands.

625
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,960
He Buzui.

626
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,440
You’re garbage.

627
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,400
It’s the most difficult time for him,

628
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,330
but you left him.

629
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
I was wrong.

630
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,680
Let us talk about this.

631
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,080
Beat He Buzui to death. I…

632
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,900
Look. It’s useful.

633
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,760
Lu Weixun.

634
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,690
Lu Weixun. Come out.

635
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,600
Let’s face everything together no matter what it is.

636
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,000
What way can you find

637
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,360
when you just lock yourself in the door?

638
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,640
What the hell.

639
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,580
Why are you still here?

640
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,320
De.

641
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,040
Would you give me the two million back?

642
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,160
Please.

643
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,800
It’s so hard for me to get the money back.

644
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Why do you think

645
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,260
I will give it to you again?

646
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,720
Tell me

647
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,920
how you can be so confident.

648
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
I will work hard

649
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,640
as before.

650
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,640
I will pay you on time every month.

651
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,080
If it’s okay,

652
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,480
I can pay additional interest.

653
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,360
Only if it doesn’t go too far.

654
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,400
Too far?

655
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,300
You still know what is too far?

656
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,320
What you require now is too far.

657
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,640
Come on.

658
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,930
Get up and look at me.

659
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,920
Do you know the tiger eats meat?

660
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,560
Yes.

661
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Do you know the tiger spits out meat?

662
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,220
Ruminants feed on grass or hay.

663
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,040
I eat meat.

664
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,320
De.

665
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,640
Come on. Stop it.

666
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,680
You know?

667
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,720
If you don’t leave soon,

668
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,050
I’ll ask them to hit you.

669
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,660
Hurry. Get out of here. Leave.

670
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,850
Even if you hit me today,

671
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,180
I’ll get my money back.

672
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,320
Let go of me.

673
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,960
De.

674
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,480
De. Please give me one more chance.
