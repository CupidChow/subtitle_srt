1
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,900
You’re up.

2
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,300
You know who is the richest person is in the world?

3
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,220
Bill Gates.

4
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,420
Buffett.

5
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,820
Jack Ma.

6
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,620
Who is it?

7
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,460
Ant-Man.

8
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,100
Ant-Man?

9
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,180
All cash machines

10
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,020
are printed with his name

11
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,740
ATM.

12
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,660
Lu Weixun,

13
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,460
was that supposed to be a joke?

14
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,900
Not funny?

15
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,020
You should smile more.

16
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,340
Your look is average.

17
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,660
A long face is even less attractive.

18
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,820
You...

19
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,520
Am I worried about myself?

20
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,940
About me, I know.

21
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,420
Then why did you...

22
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,980
Trust me.

23
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,180
We’ll win.

24
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,860
I promise.

25
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,140
Let’s eat.

26
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,900
Is it good?

27
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,990
There are 3 rounds in total.

28
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,270
For the first round,

29
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,180
one from each team

30
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,280
will select three wines for the other

31
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,820
to taste

32
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,500
and write down the names and the wineries.

33
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,180
You will have 15 minutes.

34
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,660
Ready?

35
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,700
Yes.

36
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,860
You may begin.

37
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,899
After you.

38
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,140
Blackberry, cherry, raspberry,

39
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,780
liquorice, coffee, and dirt.

40
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,300
Child’s play.

41
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,110
The first glass.

42
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,660
Blueberry, blackcurrant, blackberry.

43
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,620
Strong fruity aroma,

44
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,980
together with rose, anise,

45
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,900
and baked spices.

46
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,260
Creamy texture, layered flavor,

47
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
soft tannins

48
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,100
mixed with black fruit

49
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,140
refreshing taste.

50
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,540
Well-balanced acidity,

51
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,260
persistent aftertaste,

52
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,580
plus a hint of

53
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,180
dark chocolate.

54
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
The second glass.

55
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,300
Blackberry, liquorice.

56
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,740
Strong flavor,

57
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,700
layered, and rich.

58
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:48,580
And plum, mulberry, Shiraz,

59
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,440
but not the usual kind.

60
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,060
It’s more condensed

61
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,680
with balanced and complicated texture.

62
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,300
It’s...

63
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,700
The third glass.

64
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,980
Stop.

65
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,420
Time is up.

66
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
The first round ends.

67
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,860
Let’s see

68
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,700
the first bottle.

69
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,980
No.1,

70
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,740
Napa Valley from the U.S.

71
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,140
This is the first bottle.

72
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,940
The second one,

73
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,900
d'Arenberg The Dead Arm Shiraz,

74
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,500

75
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,540
And the last bottle,

76
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,180
it’s

77
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,940
Chateau Pavie, Saint-Emilion Grand Cru Classe, France.

78
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,780
Miss He’s answers are all correct.

79
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,380
Now,

80
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,700
let’s see Mr. Lu’s wines.

81
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,740
The first one,

82
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,230
Chateau Angelus, Saint-Emilion Grand Cru Classe, France.

83
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,220
This is the first bottle.

84
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,260
The second one,

85
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,460

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,660
And the last one,

88
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,660
Penfolds Koonunga Hill Shiraz

89
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,580
Cabernet, Australia.

90
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,820
Mr. Lu’s third answer is wrong.

91
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,620
So,

92
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,540
winners of the first round are

93
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,300
Lu Weixun and He Buzui.

94
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,360
Congratulations!

95
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,100
An entry-level Shiraz

96
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,180
from Australia,

97
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,300
sold at a little over 100 Yuan

98
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,460
with no specialty.

99
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,820
Lu Weixun,

100
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,300
well played.

101
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,260
Fine.

102
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,860
You found my weak spot.

103
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,860
You've been away from this industry for too long

104
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,060
to know the consumers’ tastes.

105
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,900
You got lucky.

106
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,380
Mr. Wan.

107
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,700
Buzui,

108
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
how have you been?

109
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,780
We’re good, thank you.

110
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,340
Sure.

111
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,980
Mr. Lu, nice to see you.

112
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,820
Have a seat.

113
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,940
Thank you.

114
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,500
How is your son Zeze doing?

115
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,140
Thank you for your concern.

116
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,500
He’s strong as an ox.

117
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,620
Good.

118
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,140
Mr. Lu,

119
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,550
thank you for giving me that chance

120
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,700
so that I could pay for Zeze's surgery

121
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,580
and we could come this far.

122
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Don’t mention it.

123
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,340
Mr. Wan and your dad seem close.

124
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,020
Is that a coincidence?

125
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,740
You know that girl?

126
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,540
She’s one of the He Wine Distillery.

127
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,700
Who?

128
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,670
He Wangyou’s daughter.

129
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,660
I remember it.

130
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,300
Enjoy your meal, sir.

131
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,100
Let’s go.

132
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,940
Mr. Wan,

133
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,340
please excuse us.

134
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Have a good night.

135
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,580
You too.

136
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,180
See you.

137
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,660
See you. Bye.

138
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,180
Zeze,

139
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,700
the doctor recommends hospitalization

140
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,030
to improve your health.

141
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,220
I’m not sick.

142
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,100
Zeze,

143
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,720
Mr. Wan is doing this for your own good

144
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,940
For the second round,

145
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,500
there are 101 glasses of wine.

146
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,180
You will taste them simultaneously.

147
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,950
The one who first

148
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,020
writes down the names of 51 glasses correctly

149
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,080
will be the winner.

150
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,500
Are you ready?

151
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,100
Yes.

152
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,780
You may begin.

153
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,580
Come.

154
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,110
You can do it.

155
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,300
Yes.

156
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,950
Let’s continue.

157
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,860
Master.

158
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,500
No need.

159
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,220
Let me save you some time.

160
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,420
We've already won.

161
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,340
Don’t be so confident.

162
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,540
Besides, they can’t get it all right.

163
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,740
Focus. Let’s continue.

164
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,070
Cabernet Franc.

165
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,060
Go ahead.

166
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,290
Winners of the second round are

167
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,540
Lu Linong and Mu Chunfeng.

168
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,079
Congratulations!

169
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,260
I’m sorry.

170
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,940
I should've done it faster.

171
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,660
It’s OK.

172
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,060
You did well enough.

173
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,220
What’s wrong?

174
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,020
Nothing.

175
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,060
I’m not used to

176
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,820
this gentle side of yours.

177
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,100
If it were before,

178
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,900
you’d be all sulky and depressed.

179
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,820
Shut up.

180
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
See you tomorrow.

181
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,580
We’ll win the third round.

182
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
See you tomorrow.

183
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,280
Good night.

184
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,740
Good night.

185
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,260
We can discuss

186
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,110
the acquisition on Wednesday.

187
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,300
Move the meeting after 2 pm.

188
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,020
Wait.

189
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,260
Don’t waste your time.

190
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,100
The third round is similar to the second.

191
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,180
No matter how close you and that Miss He are,

192
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,060
she’s not you.

193
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,220
You don’t stand a chance.

194
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,760
I shall remind you that

195
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,020
I couldn’t have an excellent palate

196
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,620
without your training.

197
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,900
Denying me

198
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,940
is denying yourself.

199
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,460
I believe in myself.

200
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,220
Weixun,

201
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,900
each glass

202
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,740
had a

203
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,900
piece of fruit in it.

204
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,020
Taste the water

205
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,340
and tell me what kind of fruit it is.

206
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,620
Watermelon.

207
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,660
Correct.

208
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,700
Next one.

209
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,300
There was no fruit in it.

210
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,260
It was mint.

211
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,220
Mint isn’t fruit.

212
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,860
Brilliant!

213
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,300
Good job!

214
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,220
If it were for mom,

215
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,510
I wish we could wind back the clock.

216
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,180
Do you really know your mom?

217
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,780
This isn’t a dream

218
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,900
but my lost memory?

219
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,540
Hello?

220
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,820
Yi Nanke,

221
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,100
I want to tell you something

222
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,860
but I’m not sure if it's real.

223
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,500
Then I don’t need to know.

224
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,860
Wait.

225
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,700
There might be a body

226
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,980
under the old winery.

227
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,070
What did you say?

228
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,220
Ever since my palate started to recover

229
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,980
after I had Pear Blossom,

230
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,780
I’ve been having

231
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,460
weird dreams.

232
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,840
I dreamed about

233
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,340
the night I fell into the wine jar.

234
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,630
The same night my dad went missing.

235
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,420
Yes.

236
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,100
In my dream, I saw

237
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,700
a person in black.

238
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,500
Who was it?

239
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,100
I don’t know.

240
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,940
I couldn’t see his face.

241
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,620
You mean it was him

242
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,780
who buried a body?

243
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,660
Yes.

244
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,000
If that’s the case,

245
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,420
we need to call the police.

246
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,140
But

247
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,740
I don’t know

248
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,580
whether it’s a dream

249
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,460
or my lost memory.

250
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,740
Perhaps I was being paranoid.

251
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,300
Without proof,

252
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,190
the police won’t file the case.

253
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,340
Let's go there

254
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,310
and check it ourselves.

255
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,780
We can go there later.

256
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,020
I mean now.

257
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,900
Now?

258
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,740
But how?

259
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,660
Your gangster friends

260
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,460
might be able to help.

261
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,860
What?

262
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,500
Yi Nanke...

263
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,060
My...

264
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,580
gangster friends?

265
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,700
De?

266
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,100
Buzui.

267
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,620
Mr. Wan.

268
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,110
It’s late. Where are you going?

269
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,480
I’m going out to meet a friend.

270
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,420
At this time?

271
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,420
Oh, I mean,

272
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,820
it’s too late and dark outside.

273
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,740
It's not safe to go out alone.

274
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,580
I can give you a ride.

275
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,660
I’m fine.

276
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,980
I’ll call a cab.

277
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,020
It’s convenient.

278
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,460
What’s your friend's name?

279
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,740
Yi Nanke.

280
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,300
We need to run an errand.

281
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,180
I’ll be back after it’s done.

282
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,540
Don’t worry about me.

283
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
Good night.

284
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,540
You’re here, too.

285
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,700
What are you doing?

286
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,660
To help him, of course.

287
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,360
Let’s go, guys.

288
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,700
What did you tell him?

289
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,780
Nothing.

290
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,620
Money talks.

291
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,580
Are we leaving or not?

292
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,580
Yi Nanke,

293
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,420
isn’t this too rash?

294
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,560
Did you forget what happened to Yang?

295
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,800
Let’s go play mahjong.

296
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,500
I lost a ton last time.

297
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,780
My hands are itchy.

298
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,620
I haven’t played for long.

299
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,280
Oh, come on.

300
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,500
Play with me, please.

301
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,620
Come back.

302
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,940
Are you blind?

303
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,480
Didn’t you see the guards?

304
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
Guards are there.

305
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
What should we do?

306
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,940
I can get us in.

307
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,620
I used to be a guard.

308
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,780
I know a thing or two.

309
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,980
Getting in is easy,

310
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,940
but after all these years,

311
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,070
this place has changed dramatically.

312
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,780
It may take a while

313
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,500
to find that old spot.

314
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,380
Let them come to us.

315
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,940
What do you mean?

316
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,780
Distraction.

317
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,060
Distraction.

318
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,820
Distraction.

319
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,140
Beibei!

320
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,300
Beibei!

321
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,900
Where are you, Beibei?

322
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,980
Beibei, come back to papa!

323
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,740
What’s going on?

324
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,820
How could you leave me, Beibei?

325
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,420
Who are you? What’s with the screaming?

326
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,620
My Beibei ran inside.

327
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,660
Who’s your Beibei?

328
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,820
It’s my dog.

329
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,740
He got in.

330
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,460
Open it.

331
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,460
- I need to find...  - What dog?

332
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,320
I didn’t see it.

333
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,580
This is a warehouse

334
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,060
of Lu Group.

335
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,550
Don't you know Lu Group?

336
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,780
Go find your dog elsewhere.

337
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,220
There’s none. Leave.

338
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,000
What’s that attitude?

339
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,960
It’s a warehouse, so what?

340
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,600
I’m not afraid of Lu Group.

341
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,500
Nobody can steal my dog!

342
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,820
Go away, you hear?

343
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,900
Are you deaf?

344
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,540
Open it.

345
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,340
No.

346
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,180
Let me in.

347
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,100
You can’t.

348
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,620
- Beibei!  - Get down.

349
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,100
- Beibei!  - Get down.  - Beibei!

350
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,540
What are you doing? Stop it!

351
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,460
- Get off it.  - Beibei!

352
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,380
- Beibei!  - Get down now! Are you nuts?

353
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,460
Guys, come here!

354
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,740
Get down!

355
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,380
What’s wrong?

356
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,940
Stop it. Get down.

357
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,020
Down.

358
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,500
- You hit me!  - What’s going on here?

359
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,300
What’s wrong?

360
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,860
Yi Nanke.

361
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,700
Be careful.

362
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,740
Gather round. There’s a fight. Go help.

363
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,500
Coming.

364
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,740
Is that it?

365
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,820
This place has changed completely.

366
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,100
Give me a minute.

367
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,460
I think it’s that warehouse.

368
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,590
Let’s go.

369
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,500
This is probably it.

370
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,610
You're ganging up against me?

371
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,340
So what?

372
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,500
What are you doing?

373
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,949
Who is it at this godly hour?

374
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,739
Get out of here now!

375
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,460
You hit me!

376
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,460
We did, so what?

377
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,020
- How dare you!  - What can you do?  - Fine.

378
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,780
Problem?

379
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,380
Fine.

380
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
You deserve it!

381
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,540
Briar, Bramble!

382
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,740
Charge!

383
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,260
Block them!

384
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:04,940
What are you doing?

385
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,020
Get down!

386
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,380
Get off it!

387
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,660
Charge!

388
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,820
Quickly. Go straight in.

389
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,580
Stop them!

390
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,220
Go away.

391
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,550
Let’s go.

392
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,260
- Catch them!  - Run!  - Hurry!

393
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,420
Stop!

394
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,540
Stop!

395
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,060
Go to hell!

396
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,300
Catch them!

397
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Stop!

398
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,380
Hello?

399
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,180
Mr. Wan,

400
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,360
the warehouse called.

401
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,520
What happened?

402
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,300
Some people barged in and were digging around.

403
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,700
They caught them?

404
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,380
Not yet.

405
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,740
Also, Mr. Wan,

406
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,860
we lost track of Yi Nanke and He Buzui.

407
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,140
So useless!

408
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,580
Should we call the police?

409
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,660
We can’t.

410
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,620
No police.

411
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,270
I’m on my way.

412
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,900
Yes.

413
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,960
I need to go out.

414
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Take care of Zeze.

415
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,880
Yes, Mr. Zhong.

416
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,020
Here, here.

417
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,620
Catch them. Hurry.

418
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,780
Stop. Don't move.

419
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,020
Here.

420
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,900
Beidao.

421
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,420
Gear up.

422
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,300
Don’t move.

423
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,940
Drop it. Don’t move.

424
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,060
Put it down.

425
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Beidao,

426
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,060
hurry up.

427
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
I got your back.

428
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,820
Beat them!

429
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,580
What is it?

430
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,860
My parents’ wedding ring.

431
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
It’s true.

432
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,660
It’s not a dream.

433
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,020
Stop.

434
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,820
Call the police.

435
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,540
Yes, call the cops.

436
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,180
No, no, no.

437
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,060
Beidao,

438
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,260
let's think about it.

439
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,180
Hey, this...

440
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:49,940
Mr. Wan.

441
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,700
Mr. Wan.

442
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,100
You’re finally here.

443
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Who called the police?

444
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,060
Not our men.

445
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,460
When did the police come?

446
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,540
A while ago.

447
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,620
They beat us for no reason.

448
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,180
I don't know why.

449
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,380
What happened?

450
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,580
They just hit us.

451
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,060
They barged in

452
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,020
on purpose.

453
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,860
Monsters!

454
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,720
The call said it was a murder case.

455
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
It is.

456
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,460
Stop your nonsense.

457
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,740
Be quiet.

458
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,020
Tell us,

459
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,310
what do you know?

460
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,100
My father, who’s been

461
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,620
missing for 20 years, might be buried here.

462
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,660
Officer,

463
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,860
that’s impossible!

464
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,380
Utterly impossible!

465
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,820
Good lord!

466
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,540
This is huge!

467
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,020
Boss,

468
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,100
a murder case.

469
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,300
I’m scared.

470
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,540
What are you afraid of?

471
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,220
We're now part of

472
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
something huge.

473
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,500
- Mr. Wan.  - Mr. Wan.  - Mr. Wan.

474
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,660
- Mr. Wan.  - Mr. Wan.

475
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,900
- Good evening, officer.  - Good evening.

476
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,020
Nice to meet you.

477
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,100
Officer,

478
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,460
sorry for troubling you.

479
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,300
Mr. Wan.

480
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:11,980
I apologize.

481
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,500
You know him?

482
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,700
You can talk to me.

483
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,060
He used to work in my dad’s winery.

484
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,380
We received a call about a murder case.

485
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,910
I thought you knew him, too.

486
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,500
Buzui,

487
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,150
what are you doing here?

488
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,620
You know them?

489
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,140
Yes, I know that girl.

490
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,220
Buzui,

491
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,500
is he that friend you talked about?

492
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,780
Naughty girl.

493
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,500
Go back now.

494
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,020
Mr. Wan,

495
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,700
are you aware

496
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,140
there might be a body buried here?

497
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,540
Young man,

498
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,000
be careful about what you say.

499
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,820
This is proof.

500
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,660
Bag it.

501
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,260
We’ll conduct an investigation

502
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,260
to verify it.

503
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,300
In the meantime, you can’t leave

504
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
before it’s over.

505
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,780
We’ll take you to the station for statements.

506
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,540
All of you!

507
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,700
We’re doomed!
