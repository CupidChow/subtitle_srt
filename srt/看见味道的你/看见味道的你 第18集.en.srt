1
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,759
Thank you for a nice stay.

2
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,280
You are welcome!

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,039
Thanks, Mr. Wan.

4
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,880
It’s my pleasure.

5
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,720
Hope you’ll come again.

6
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,360
Sure, we will.

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,920
Bye!

8
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,640
Bye!

9
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,810
You are so early.

10
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,800
Mr. Wan, shall we go now?

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,760
We are so behind our schedule.

12
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
We have to go to the winery today.

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,520
The car is not big enough

14
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,040
to hold all of you.

15
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,650
Bai Jing, you stay here.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,160
Why me?

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
If I get lost,

18
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
how are you gonna explain to my parents?

19
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,560
You stay here!

20
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,370
I can be your assistant!

21
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,600
She must go.

22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,320
You…

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,600
You stay here.

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,620
You are the most useless one.

25
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
We don’t need you.

26
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,040
I’m useless?

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,940
I’m the assistant and bodyguard of Lu Weixun’s assistant!

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,130
I say, you are the most useless one!

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Weixun, look!

30
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,840
How dare he talk to me like that?

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,760
Alright, stop.

32
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,680
Hao Yong, you stay.

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
Then let’s go.

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,680
Please watch the suitcases for us.

35
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,090
Don’t lose them!

36
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,380
You are really leaving me here alone?

37
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
Welcome! Welcome!

38
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,560
Welcome!

39
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,130
Mr. Yang!

40
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,400
Zeze!

41
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,440
Zeze!

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,200
They are

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,120
the people I mentioned to you.

44
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,400
This is Lu Weixun,

45
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,040
a well-known sommelier.

46
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,720
I’ve heard so much about you!

47
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,320
Zeze talks about you a lot.

48
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,840
I was.

49
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,520
This is his girlfriend.

50
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
Assistant.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,659
Assistant.

52
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,360
He Buzui.

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,920
Good name!

54
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,200
He Buzui!

55
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,960
How catchy!

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,640
This is Yi Nanke,

57
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,980
owner of a popular bar.

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,050
Nice to meet you.

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,240
This is Bai Jing. She’s from France.

60
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,400
Miss Bai.

61
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,760
Nice to meet you.

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,160
You too.

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,920
Welcome!

64
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,320
You are

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,160
all Zeze’s friends.

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,720
So you are my friends too.

67
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,820
Zeze already told me

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,040
why you are here.

69
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,530
But unfortunately,

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
we don’t produce Pear Blossom anymore.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What?

72
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,020
It’s been over a month.

73
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,159
How interesting!

74
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,960
Mr. Yang,

75
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
I remember last month you still asked me

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
to take some for my dad.

77
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,680
That was the last batch.

78
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,440
I know your dad likes to drink.

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,700
So I saved some for him.

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,600
Now I don’t have any.

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
It’s alright.

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,820
Since we are here already,

83
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,760
we’ll just take some other wine back.

84
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,290
Make the trip worth, right?

85
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,440
Right!

86
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,640
It’s the first time

87
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,000
they come visit this winery,

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,680
let’s show them around a little.

89
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,920
Sure!

90
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,100
Please come in!

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
Let’s go!

92
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,640
Come on.

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,320
This way.

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,480
This way! Over here!

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
Please follow me.

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,680
Our winery has many turns.

97
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,360
You’ll get lost easy.

98
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
Here, follow me.

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520
Let me introduce.

100
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,960
Our winery

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,120
adopts ancestral brewing methods.

102
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,600
It’s

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,250
pure grain brewing,

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
no blending.

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,840
As the saying goes, “Good wine needs no bush,”

106
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,920
our winery never advertises

107
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,500
as people know how good our wine is

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
and always order

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,920
by a large number of bottles.

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,480
They usually save the wine for special occasions.

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,600
Although our winery is small

112
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,170
and has no advanced equipment,

113
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,159
our wine

114
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,920
has already been sold

115
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
on overseas market.

116
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,960
Come here.

117
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,140
These types of wine

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,600
are specially made by our winery.

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,380
This is bayberry wine.

120
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,080
This is plum wine.

121
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,400
This is yam wine.

122
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,520
And this is highland barley wine.

123
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,440
Please have a taste.

124
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,720
The flavor of the wine here is very rich.

125
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
The older the wine is, the better it tastes.

126
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,200
These types of wine are all about 10-20 years old.

127
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,240
Please try some.

128
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,320
The spirit tastes sharp

129
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
and strong.

130
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,500
I don’t know what’s good about it.

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,600
Mr. Yang.

132
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
The passage we just passed by,

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
what’s that for?

134
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
It’s a storage house,

135
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,240
for storing old equipment.

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,720
You can’t smoke here! Please don’t!

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Beware of fire!

138
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,640
It’s a non-smoking area!

139
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,010
I’ll go somewhere else.

140
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,320
Let me

141
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,520
show you our workshop.

142
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,360
This way.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,640
Mr. Yang.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,730
I have to visit the girl’s room.

145
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Just proceed without me.

146
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
I’ll be back soon!

147
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,930
Now, let’s go first.

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
This way.

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,120
Yi Nanke.

150
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,480
You think there’s something wrong too?

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,280
I think I smelled something familiar.

152
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,280
Let’s go.

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,440
This is the smell of Pear Blossom!

154
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,610
How is it?

155
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,320
Not bad huh?

156
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,840
Miss Bai.

157
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,720
You work for WSA,

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,400
which enjoys high international reputation.

159
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,760
Would you like to

160
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
introduce Chinese spirit culture

161
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,400
to the world?

162
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,540
We don’t know much about spirit.

163
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,840
We only focus on wine and Whiskey.

164
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,850
As long as you’d like to try.

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,920
I’m actually going to

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
start red wine business.

167
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,260
Of course,

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
not at here.

169
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,410
I need to go to the restroom.

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,700
You guys keep talking.

171
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Try to hurry.

172
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,360
Zeze,

173
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,900
I’ve asked them to prepare lunch.

174
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
Let’s eat here today.

175
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,240
Okay.

176
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
We have enough wine here.

177
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Drink as much as you want!

178
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,800
The smell comes out from inside.

179
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,960
But the door is locked.

180
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,220
There’s not even a window.

181
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
How are we supposed to get in?

182
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,420
Are you sure this is the place?

183
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,160
You are quite good at this!

184
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,320
Even have a tool.

185
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,300
All skills have pros and cons.

186
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
Bad people use them to do bad things.

187
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,220
Yet good people

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,040
use them to punish bad people.

189
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,960
That makes sense!

190
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
Don’t you have any safety awareness?

191
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,980
It’s dangerous

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,060
going in like this.

193
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,660
This room is locked up.

194
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,520
They must try to hide something.

195
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,370
I’ll go first, you stay behind.

196
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,200
That’s it!

197
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
It is Pear Blossom!

198
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Judging from the wet ground,

199
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,170
the wine shouldn’t have been destroyed for long.

200
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,660
This Mr. Yang

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,460
must have something to do with the incident.

202
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,040
And he must be related to my father’s death!

203
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,360
I’ll go confront him!

204
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,960
Wait!

205
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,670
It might alert them.

206
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
If they really have something to do with Pear Blossom,

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,050
they must have already prepared for this.

208
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,240
Plus, these broken wine bottles

209
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,660
won’t prove Mr. Yang is guilty.

210
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,280
Without evidence,

211
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
even if we call the police,

212
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,410
they can’t arrest them.

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
So we’ll just wait?

214
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,740
He is obviously involved!

215
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,040
Yi Nanke,

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,880
take some pictures

217
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,840
as proof.

218
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,620
I’ll collect some wine

219
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,640
as samples.

220
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,160
Who is it?

221
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,300
Somebody locked the door!

222
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,520
Now,

223
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,200
step back.

224
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,780
It must be Mr. Yang!

225
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,320
He is definitely related to the whole thing!

226
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,400
Mr. Yang is

227
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,760
such a decent man.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,240
Especially to his wife,

229
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,800
he’s very caring

230
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,960
and sweet!

231
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,140
About that,

232
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,080
people might think I’m henpecked,

233
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,320
but I think

234
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,480
it should be called compromise!

235
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,040
Love

236
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,570
- is compromise!  - Boss.

237
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,520
Zeze.

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Please accompany Miss Bai to take a walk.

239
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Excuse me for a while.

240
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay.

241
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,940
I’ll see you later.

242
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,280
I don’t want to eat here.

243
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Let’s go back.

244
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,880
It’ll be fine. Try it.

245
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
It’s not bad.

246
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,000
He Buzui!

247
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,360
He Buzui!

248
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,660
- He Buzui!  - Lu Weixun!

249
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
It’s Lu wiexun!

250
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Lu Weixun!

251
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,840
He Buzui!

252
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
Lu Weixun!

253
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,120
We are in here!

254
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,680
He Buzui!

255
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,840
Lu Weixun!

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,130
Is it you, Lu Weixun?

257
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
We are in here!

258
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,320
We found Pear Blossom!

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,060
The door is locked!

260
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,640
So Mr. Yang is really hiding something!

261
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,480
Stay calm!

262
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,860
I’ll try to break the lock and get you out!

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,720
Hold on!

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
Stop! It won’t work!

265
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,640
If only you were the one outside.

266
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,600
At least you know how to pick a lock!

267
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
If I were outside,

268
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,380
I might not be willing to help you!

269
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
It’s not the time!

270
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,280
Could you let it go?

271
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Stop it!

272
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,640
Go hide yourself!

273
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,460
Mr. Yang must have known that we are here.

274
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
If you get caught too,

275
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,720
we’ll all be dead.

276
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,080
Okay!

277
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
Then I’ll go get Mr. Yang.

278
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,800
Hold on!

279
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,720
Wait for me!

280
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,890
He Buzui!

281
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,720
Be brave!

282
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,280
Why isn’t he back yet?

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Weixun, I’ve been waiting.

284
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,800
what took you so long?

285
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Where’s Mr. Yang?

286
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,240
He asked us to

287
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,360
have lunch here.

288
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,200
Crap!

289
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,960
What’s wrong?

290
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Mr. Yang is up to no good!

291
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,400
What?

292
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,240
Why?

293
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,160
He might be involved in a murder!

294
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
Are you serious?

295
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,040
How come?

296
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,580
Mr. Yang wouldn’t do that!

297
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,120
They’ve collected evidence

298
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,250
about Pear Blossom.

299
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,080
I’ll call the police and let them

300
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,480
investigate Mr. Yang.

301
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,400
You guys leave first.

302
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,320
I’ll go find Mr. Yang.

303
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,960
No.

304
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,360
I won’t leave without you!

305
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,040
Bai Jing!

306
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,320
What? Let’s go together!

307
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,960
You go first!

308
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,920
Take her to go! Hurry!

309
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,240
- Why?  - Hurry!

310
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,250
Hurry up!

311
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,200
Weixun!

312
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,839
Right!

313
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,680
They are here for Pear Blossom.

314
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Mr. Wan,

315
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,109
they were brought by your son Zeze.

316
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
And Zeze is with them too.

317
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
He must have no idea what’s going on.

318
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,200
He’s being used.

319
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,120
Don’t worry.

320
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,280
I’ll make sure he’s safe.

321
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,880
I’ve locked up those

322
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,900
who are looking for Pear Blossom.

323
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,100
Don’t worry.

324
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
That’s right.

325
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,360
Get rid of them?

326
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,000
Well…

327
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
Mr. Wan, is it necessary?

328
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,800
Mr. Wan,

329
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
they are all kids.

330
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Can’t we just scare them off?

331
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,570
It’s not necessary.

332
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,800
You know

333
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,980
that I only want to make money.

334
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,400
We don’t have to do this.

335
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,840
Hello?

336
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,860
Some people got kidnapped in Joy Winery.

337
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,680
Who are you?

338
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,010
Move!

339
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,680
What?

340
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,580
What are you doing?

341
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,520
Move!

342
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,760
How are you related to Pear Blossom?

343
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,680
Who asked you to do this?

344
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,360
Pear Blossom?

345
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,250
What are you talking about?

346
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
I’m not sure I follow you!

347
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Don’t play dumb!

348
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,840
I know

349
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,500
that you locked up my friends!

350
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,490
You’d better set them free now!

351
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,900
Otherwise you’ll face serious penalty!

352
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,980
Why are you accusing me of?

353
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
You don’t have any evidence! It’s a slander!

354
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,340
I should sue you!

355
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,240
Sue me?

356
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,050
You are the one wants to kill us!

357
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,640
Don’t you have family?

358
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
How could you do

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,530
a ruthless thing like this?

360
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,920
You want to sue me

361
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,320
because of

362
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,200
a few empty wine bottles?

363
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,400
Hello, Mr. Wan.

364
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,320
Listen,

365
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,320
if you don’t get rid of them now,

366
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,120
don’t blame me I didn’t warn you.

367
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,440
Well, Mr. Wan…

368
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,340
Yang!

369
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,120
What’s going on?

370
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,160
Honey?

371
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,520
How did you…

372
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
Mr. Wan! Mr. Wan!

373
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,880
Please don’t do this!

374
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,720
You can’t do this to me!

375
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,040
I haven’t seen your wife for a long time.

376
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
We’ll have a nice talk

377
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,840
and catch up.

378
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,240
Just finish your work

379
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
at hand,

380
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,560
then come to my house for a drink!

381
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,920
Mr. Wan! Mr. Wan!

382
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,480
I feel dizzy!

383
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
The air here is filled

384
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,400
with alcohol.

385
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,060
And there’s no window.

386
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,700
We’ll be suffocated if we stay here for too long.

387
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,120
And the floor is covered by alcohol,

388
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,960
we’ll be dead

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,600
if Yang throws in a lit match!

390
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,080
I don’t want to die!

391
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,480
I haven’t lived long enough!

392
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,980
I can’t die either!

393
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,360
I still have a lot to do.

394
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,160
Lu Weixun!

395
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,400
Where are you?

396
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,200
Are you okay?

397
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,690
- Come here and sit down…  - I’m fine!

398
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,080
Hypocrite!

399
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,200
Hypocrite?

400
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,560
Can’t you see

401
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,440
that I want to help?

402
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,520
He Buzui.

403
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,090
I can forget the grudge held against our parents.

404
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,380
But you are still accountable for

405
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
my brother’s death!

406
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,320
I wouldn’t forgive myself either

407
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,160
if it were really because of me.

408
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,840
Right,

409
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,530
you should feel guilty!

410
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,010
Because of your family,

411
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,480
I’m the only one left in mine.

412
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
When I was little,

413
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,560
my parents had me

414
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,400
Eat more.

415
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,520
And my brother.

416
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,120
Everybody was happy

417
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,520
even just having a simple dinner together.

418
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,100
I wish I could stay in that happy moment forever.

419
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,000
Until one day, my dad was gone.

420
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,440
And my mom was in deep sorrow.

421
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,880
To get justice for my dad,

422
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,800
my mom took us to He Wine Distillery.

423
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,400
But your dad, He Wangyou,

424
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,480
was intended to shut our mouth by money!

425
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,840
My mom told me

426
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,680
that my dad was gone because of your father!

427
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,410
Then my mom tried to find my dad all over the place.

428
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,570
But she fell ill not long after.

429
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,690
Ironically, it was such a small world,

430
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,200
I met you in high school.

431
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,240
I wanted you to suffer.

432
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,000
But when I watched you being bullied,

433
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,680
my brother saved you.

434
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,880
You know what,

435
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,720
He’s changed

436
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,970
ever since I met you!

437
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,180
Why did you do that?

438
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,040
You promised you won’t touch her again!

439
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,240
You promised you won’t help her again, but you did anyway!

440
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,920
What?

441
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
You are going to hit me for that girl?

442
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,160
You like her?

443
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,920
I don’t!

444
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,770
Do you swear?

445
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,680
I swear!

446
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,490
Are you okay?

447
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,320
I’m fine.

448
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,840
And then, in order to buy you a birthday gift,

449
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,560
my brother worked too hard

450
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,840
and died from overfatigue.

451
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,280
The misfortune

452
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,760
of my whole family

453
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,810
was brought by your father and you!

454
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,600
When I went to my brother’s place

455
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,880
with his things,

456
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,480
I found his diary.

457
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,760
September 1, 2012.

458
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,480
School starts today.

459
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,540
I just arrived city B,

460
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,160
still haven’t got used to it.

461
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,820
Nanke is left to check-in by himself.

462
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Will he do well?

463
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,080
Hope everything’s fine.

464
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,960
December 24, 2012.

465
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,290
Today is Christmas Eve.

466
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Mom is sick again.

467
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,640
The medicine cost a lot.

468
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,960
I need to find a job.

469
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,400
It’s the first snow in City B.

470
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Nanke feels quite happy.

471
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,920
I think I’ll tell him about mom later.

472
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,560
Hi!

473
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,840
Hi! Please take a look!

474
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,160
January 1, 2013.

475
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,880
I found a job!

476
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
I’ll take Nanke out for dinner tonight!

477
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,720
Hurry up! Customers will be here soon!

478
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,160
Okay!

479
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,720
February 10, 2013.

480
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,400
It’s the first time I didn’t go home for New Year.

481
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,460
But Nanke is there,

482
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,330
hope mom won’t feel lonely.

483
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,800
Buzui.

484
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,400
Happy New Year!

485
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,000
March 11, 2013.

486
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,080
My job is getting busier,

487
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,860
and I can’t see Nanke quite often now.

488
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,730
He seems to be angry with me.

489
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,880
Hope he can find a girlfriend this year.

490
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,520
How about you?

491
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
Have you been doing well?

492
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,680
April 1, 2013.

493
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,200
Beginning of spring.

494
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,800
The weather is getting warm.

495
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,290
The doctor said mom is getting better.

496
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,210
Nanke is very happy about that.

497
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,180
It’ll be your track and field contest next week.

498
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
Good luck!

499
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,920
April 30, 2013.

500
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,480
I haven’t heard from you for a long time.

501
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,810
It makes me feel uneasy.

502
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,520
Where will you go to university?

503
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,050
Will we be able to see each other again?

504
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,800
July 8, 2013.

505
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,490
I’ve been feeling so tired.

506
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,780
But the thought of seeing you soon

507
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,440
cheers me up greatly!

508
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,960
I still remember the pale look of my brother.

509
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,160
That was the last time I saw him.

510
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,730
Brother.

511
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,880
Mail this to mom.

512
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,970
Brother!

513
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,690
Brother!

514
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
How hard do you want to push yourself?

515
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
You’ve become like this.

516
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,800
Why do you still work so hard to buy birthday gift for He Buzui?

517
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,960
She is your enemy!

518
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,280
I like her.

519
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,340
I want to do something for her.

520
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,220
You don’t understand.

521
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,200
My brother thought that he forgot

522
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,000
his password for his QQ account.

523
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,720
Actually I changed it

524
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,920
without telling him.

525
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,820
After I got out of the jail,

526
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,140
I logged on his QQ account,

527
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,500
and I saw that you kept sending him messages.

528
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,640
Do you know how happy I was?

529
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,200
Could you not think of others

530
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,640
from your point of view?

531
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,840
Do you know

532
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
that your brother

533
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,560
didn’t want you to waste your time

534
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,720
on taking revenge.

535
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,320
He only wanted you to be happy and safe!

536
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,320
Yi Nanke.

537
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,080
You are his twin brother!

538
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,920
But you don’t understand him at all!

539
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,520
His heart was filled with love.

540
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,480
He never hated anybody.

541
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,800
All he wanted was you to be happy!

542
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,440
But you…

543
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,920
Look what you’ve become!

544
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,640
You disappointed him!

545
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
The one who should feel sorry

546
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,880
is you,

547
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,400
not me.

548
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
You had a chance to stay alive,

549
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,690
but you stuck to look for death!

550
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,730
Just a few kids! You think you can screw me?

551
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,920
You overestimated yourselves!

552
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,080
What are you hiding?

553
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
Tell us!

554
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Let me tell you,

555
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,880
you can’t afford to play this game!

556
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,080
You’ll lose your lives!

557
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,640
Listen!

558
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,480
If I let you go,

559
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,080
and you swear you’ll never

560
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,210
mention anything about Pear Blossom,

561
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,860
I’ll spare your lives.

562
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,840
Otherwise,

563
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,640
none of you can leave here!

564
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,160
Where’s Yi Jianguo?

565
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,520
Did you also

566
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,480
kidnap him like this?

567
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,120
Yi Jianguo?

568
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,120
Why do you ask about him?

569
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,180
How do you know him?

570
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,040
Where’s my dad?

571
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,760
You guys know too much!

572
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,720
It’s either you die or I die!

573
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,440
You can all disappear together with Pear Blossom!

574
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,640
What are you gonna do?

575
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,920
What are you gonna do?

576
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,170
You shall be responsible for your act!

577
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,000
Let us out!

578
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,160
Open the door!

579
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,960
Wan Zeze.

580
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,120
Will Weixun be in danger?

581
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,180
He was so furious just now!

582
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,640
It was an emergency.

583
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,290
You need to understand him.

584
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,120
Wan Zeze.

585
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,160
You and your father can’t even tell

586
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,560
who’s good and who’s bad!

587
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,450
Mr. Yang is my father’s friend.

588
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,320
He’s been very nice to me.

589
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,760
I don’t think he would do something like that!

590
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,280
No.

591
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,450
I have to go back!

592
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,840
It’s too complicated.

593
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,440
And I brought you guys over there.

594
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,480
How could I leave?

595
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,920
I need to go back too!

596
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,160
I can’t leave Weixun alone

597
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,890
in a dangerous place like that!

598
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,530
Let’s go!

599
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,250
Have you gotten rid of them?

600
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,440
I have.

601
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,960
Don’t worry!

602
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,630
If you don’t get rid of them

603
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,120
and the evidence,

604
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,120
you will be dead.

605
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,100
Luckily, you are quite smart.

606
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,630
I got it! Got it!

607
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,480
Mr. Wan.

608
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,880
Hello?

609
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,670
Honey!

610
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,480
Okay! Okay!

611
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,400
I’ll go to pick you up now!

612
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,080
Be patient!

613
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,600
Yi Nanke!

614
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,880
Yi Nanke!

615
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,400
Hold on!

616
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,280
How come we are off today?

617
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,940
Don’t know!

618
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,530
- Why are we off?  - Who cares!

619
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,960
Have you seen Mr. Yang?

620
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,040
- No!  - No! No!

621
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,200
He’s injured!

622
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,170
Look at his hand!

623
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,520
Badly injured.

624
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,720
He Buzui!

625
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,000
Lu Weixun!

626
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,040
I’m here!

627
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,440
Hold on!

628
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,120
Mr. Yang said

629
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
that he’ll let us disappear together with Pear Blossom.

630
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,330
He Buzui!

631
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,700
I’ve called the police!

632
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,600
They’ll be here soon!

633
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Hold on!

634
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,800
Please go!

635
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,640
If he sets here on fire,

636
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,760
it’ll explode.

637
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
Then, we’ll…

638
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
we’ll all…

639
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,640
No!

640
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,360
I won’t go!

641
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,200
I’m right here!

642
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,840
Stop trying!

643
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,120
Just go!

644
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,240
You can’t open the door!

645
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,080
I’ll be here with you!

646
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,960
I haven’t found your sense of taste back!

647
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,000
Lu Weixun.

648
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,760
If

649
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I’m gone,

650
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,920
will your sense of taste be gone too?

651
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,040
I don’t want my sense of taste!

652
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
I only want you!

653
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,080
He Buzui! Hold on!

654
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,040
Do you hear me?

655
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,680
Hold on!

656
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,560
Hello?

657
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,080
I want to book two tickets to America.

658
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,010
As soon as possible!

659
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,200
The Mr. Yang you talked about

660
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,860
didn’t set the winery on fire.

661
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,320
We found a burnt-out match in the storage house.

662
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,520
But we can’t find him.

663
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,960
I’ll continue to investigate.

664
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,690
Don’t worry.

665
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,080
Thanks!

666
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,360
Turns out Mr. Yang still has some conscience.

667
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,400
Because I’m blessed!

668
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,920
See,

669
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,640
shouldn’t you be nice

670
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,970
to a lucky penny like me?

671
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,640
So you mean

672
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,980
I can’t leave you anymore?

673
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,040
You injured badly!

674
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,600
Does it hurt?

675
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,600
I’m fine.

676
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,240
Let me see that hand.

677
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,810
It’s not hurt. I’m fine.

678
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,520
Let me see!

679
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,480
We’d better get out of here.

680
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,480
Come on.

681
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Let’s go see a doctor.
