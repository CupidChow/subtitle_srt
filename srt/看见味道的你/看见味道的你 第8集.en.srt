1
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,810
We don’t have much time.

2
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,700
Twenty bottles each day.

3
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,039
I suggest you spitting it out

4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,600
after you taste it and

5
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,870
know its flavor.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,280
Spit it out?

7
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,840
The wines are so good.

8
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
It is

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,890
too extravagant to do that.

10
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
They are my wines.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,210
No need to feel sorry for me.

12
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,360
I don’t want to waste them.

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,520
Unplug them.

14
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,960
I ask you to taste the wine.

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,560
It’s not a drinking game.

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,490
Observe it firstly.

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,240
What color do you think it is?

18
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,000
Red.

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,960
The color of wines can tell you information.

20
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,480
The light color

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,410
indicates the taste is gentle,

22
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
like Pinot noir

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,160
and Gamay.

24
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,680
The dark color

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
indicates the taste is rich,

26
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
like Cabernet Sauvignon,

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,960
Syrah, etc.

28
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,250
For the wines of many years’ standing,

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,000
the color changes from ruby red to pomegranate red,

30
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,560
even to red brown.

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,520
It’s more complicated than lip sticks.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,760
I’ve observed it.

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,880
Can I drink it?

34
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Be patient.

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,920
The wine legs,

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,320
namely wine tears,

37
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,530
can reflect the alcohol level,

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,600
and

39
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,520
can also indicate the intensity of wine.

40
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,220
The aroma is the door to learning about the wine.

41
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,490
You can judge the intensity

42
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
through the aroma.

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,640
Through the aroma of wine,

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,680
we can judge the grape type, growing environment,

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,400
picking season, brewing techniques,

46
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,480
aging time, etc.

47
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,680
So amazing!

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,800
Try it then.

49
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,760
I can’t smell anything.

50
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
You did it too hard

51
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,760
to smell anything.

52
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,890
The alcohol can paralyze your sense of smell.

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
I... I get the aroma!

54
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,000
But... I still don’t know what it is.

55
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Take a sip.

56
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
Don’t drink it up.

57
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,440
Take a sip.

58
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,800
Leave enough space and

59
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,680
keep the wine in your mouth.

60
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,760
The amount shouldn’t be too little

61
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,090
to be covered by saliva.

62
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,600
What do you get?

63
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,480
Black pepper!

64
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,820
How could it be?

65
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
How come the wine

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,659
has the taste of black pepper?

67
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
You are right.

68
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,680
Different grapes

69
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,560
have their own specific flavors.

70
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,460
The wine of black pepper taste

71
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,720
is the Syrah specialty in the cold area.

72
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,400
But

73
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,480
it isn’t enough

74
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,260
to know the exact producing area.

75
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,120
Can you feel

76
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,120
any other taste?

77
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
It’s sour

78
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,280
like plums.

79
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
How come there are mosaics

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,600
on the light board?

81
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,720
Mosaics?

82
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,800
Have you ever tasted violets?

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Violets?

84
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
I have never tasted those petals.

85
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,200
But the wine tastes really good.

86
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,440
Sorry. The bar isn’t open.

87
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,120
How do you do?

88
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
If you come to apologize, then do it.

89
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
If not,

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,740
get out of here.

91
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,260
Apologize?

92
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
You should apologize to me.

93
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,720
Beat him!

94
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,460
Apologize!

95
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,040
I’m sorry!

96
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,090
Say sorry to her!

97
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,400
Sister.

98
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
He beats me!

99
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
Did you come here to make trouble?

100
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,120
No, I didn’t.

101
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,200
I did it for you.

102
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,130
I was afraid that

103
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,160
he would harass you.

104
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,760
He beat me when I came.

105
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,280
Sister.

106
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,690
How could you be with this scum?

107
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
He is sly

108
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,200
and violent.

109
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,400
Shut up!

110
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,160
Mind your own business.

111
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,080
Leave now!

112
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,400
Sister.

113
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,000
I did it for you!

114
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,410
You did it for yourself!

115
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Get out of here!

116
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,610
Let’s go!

117
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,740
Have a seat.

118
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Thank you.

119
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Just a glass of wine.

120
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,040
Not at all.

121
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
I mean

122
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,860
my brother.

123
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,400
I can’t believe

124
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,200
he is your brother.

125
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,860
I can’t believe it either.

126
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,410
If you didn’t come here,

127
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,650
I would have given him a lesson.

128
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,980
Anyway, he is my biological brother.

129
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,840
In some cases,

130
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,250
kinship can be the source of evilness.

131
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,660
That’s why

132
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,520
I have no idea how to deal with him.

133
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,920
I don't want others to know...

134
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,200
We all have secrets.

135
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,660
Don't say it if you

136
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,480
don’t want to.

137
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Your grades are good.

138
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,080
But you ruined

139
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,540
so many good wines.

140
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,320
If I studied hard in the college entrance exam,

141
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,520
I could have been very successful.

142
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,370
Don’t be strict with yourself.

143
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,940
You should thank the gods

144
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
to be admitted to college.

145
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,800
Sleepy?

146
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,040
A little bit.

147
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,760
Well,

148
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,970
I give you one day off tomorrow.

149
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,040
But you must come back before dinner.

150
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,800
I must be dreaming

151
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,000
What did you say?

152
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
You give me one day off?

153
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,040
Are you touched by my hard work,

154
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,360
or do you suddenly have a conscience?

155
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,570
If you don’t want it,

156
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,360
I can cancel it.

157
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,040
Don’t!

158
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,000
It's rare to have a holiday.

159
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,000
I should think about how to spend it.

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,530
I don’t care how you spend it

161
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,440
do not violate the rules.

162
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,440
Okay!

163
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,760
Lu Weixun.

164
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,540
We are familiar now.

165
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
I find you are a nice guy.

166
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,530
We are not familiar.

167
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,720
And,

168
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,620
don’t laugh like that.

169
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,040
Why?

170
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,540
It’s ugly.

171
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,360
Hello.

172
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,960
Beidao.

173
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,000
See you at 8 a.m. at the old place tomorrow.

174
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,130
I have a gift for you.

175
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,570
It’s ok if you want to go out,

176
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,680
but it depends on whom you hang out with.

177
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,520
It’s not ok if you hang out with him.

178
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,920
He is my senior at school.

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,800
Why isn’t it ok?

180
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,040
Because I said so.

181
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,000
What does that have to do with you?

182
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
What if he went after my taste

183
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,960
and tried to take them away?

184
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,240
He has something to give me.

185
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,220
How come I refuse that?

186
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,400
I do nothing wrong.

187
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,720
I am not afraid

188
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,730
even if he blames me.

189
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Haven't you left?

190
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,200
Do you want some work?

191
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,640
No! I’m gonna leave

192
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,240
right now.

193
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,970
I’m leaving!

194
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,600
Bye!

195
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,920
Come back before dinner!

196
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,560
Hello?

197
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,160
Is it Hao Yong?

198
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,720
Buzui.

199
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,320
Senior!

200
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,720
I’m sorry to keep you waiting.

201
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,780
You used to wait me.

202
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,660
For the first time, I find it so annoying to wait.

203
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,920
I’m sorry.

204
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,800
You waited for me so many times.

205
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,880
Never mind.

206
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,970
Let’s go.

207
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,360
Where?

208
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,410
You’ll know it soon.

209
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,040
Go.

210
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,530
Happy birthday!

211
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,400
Thank you.

212
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,080
You even remember my birthday!

213
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,200
Not a big deal.

214
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,960
It’s in my mind.

215
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,280
I even forgot it myself.

216
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,040
Lu Weixun gave me one day off.

217
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,170
Or else, I couldn’t have come here.

218
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,010
Let’s go.

219
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:09,920
Go.

220
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,960
Bye!

221
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,440
Look!

222
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
Are you sure she will like these?

223
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,520
Mr. Lu.

224
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,920
You asked me to help you

225
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,720
because I know He Buzui well.

226
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,770
Trust me.

227
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,420
The color and the style

228
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,000
are her favorites.

229
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,080
I even think

230
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,480
I know her better than herself.

231
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,480
You...

232
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
We are comrades,

233
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,720
purely.

234
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,280
Mr. Lu.

235
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
You are

236
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,600
her boss,

237
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,400
and you celebrate her birthday.

238
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,290
You are pretty good.

239
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,160
I just pity her.

240
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,320
Nothing more.

241
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,160
But,

242
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,760
it’s not easy for her indeed.

243
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,880
What do you mean?

244
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,200
I mean

245
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,360
it isn’t easy to work for you.

246
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,480
You are a perfectionist

247
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,800
and have high expectation.

248
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,340
Right?

249
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,600
Hurry up.

250
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
She will be back soon.

251
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,820
No problem.

252
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,080
We wander in the autumn

253
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,340
Your profile is so handsome at sunset

254
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,080
Raise head and see your tender eyes

255
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,000
It makes my heartbeat accelerate

256
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,320
The feeling to be with you is so special

257
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,720
You make me feel so warm

258
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,520
Beidao.

259
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,160
The night view here is so beautiful.

260
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,100
I didn’t find it before.

261
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,080
Yeah.

262
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,410
It’s beautiful.

263
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,080
Thank you.

264
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,440
I had a great time.

265
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,160
I am so happy today.

266
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,920
You like it?

267
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,800
Yes, I like it.

268
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,100
I feel so great!

269
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,080
Do you like me?

270
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,400
Do you like me?

271
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Be my girlfriend.

272
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,680
Beidao.

273
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,480
- I...  - I know.

274
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,800
I know your feelings for me.

275
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,360
And I want you to know my feelings

276
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,600
as well.

277
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,720
Buzui is so lucky

278
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,640
that she can eat dishes

279
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,960
cooked by you.

280
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,400
This is not just for her.

281
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,280
I want to eat it,

282
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,480
so I make some for her as well.

283
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,480
Can I have it?

284
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,880
No.

285
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,000
Hao Yong.

286
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,340
Do you think

287
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
if she will be moved

288
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,730
by what we prepared for her?

289
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,340
Don’t worry about that.

290
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,000
Listen.

291
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
As I know,

292
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,880
when she sees these,

293
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,920
she will surely

294
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
be deeply moved.

295
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,330
But, how come she hasn’t come back?

296
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,640
She usually comes back

297
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,120
in the last five minutes.

298
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,850
Hao Yong.

299
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Where is the cake?

300
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,280
The cake?

301
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,580
There. Over there.

302
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,320
What’s wrong?

303
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,560
It’s doomed!

304
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
What should we do?

305
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,100
Something bad is gonna happen.

306
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,080
What do you mean?

307
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,100
This is...

308
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
A gift for your birthday.

309
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,760
I prepared this gift seven years ago.

310
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,680
I'm giving it to you now.

311
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,000
Buzui.

312
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,760
Be my girlfriend.

313
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,080
Why did he avoid me intentionally when I confessed my love

314
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
to him seven years ago?

315
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
Beidao.

316
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,880
I’m sorry.

317
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,240
I appreciate what you did

318
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,040
and said today,

319
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,280
I am really moved.

320
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,680
And,

321
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,200
I admit that

322
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,920
I fell for you before.

323
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,720
But now,

324
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,560
I...

325
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,680
I can’t accept your love.

326
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,440
Why?

327
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,200
I have to tell you

328
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,800
about something.

329
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,640
Say it.

330
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,520
I’m working for Lu Weixun now.

331
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,560
I know it.

332
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,400
This matter

333
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,320
is... is embarrassing

334
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,400
and also absurd.

335
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,920
But what I’m gonna say

336
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,280
is true.

337
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,560
Beidao.

338
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,720
Please believe me.

339
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,300
I believe you all the time.

340
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,280
Due to an accident, my sense of taste was exchanged

341
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
with Lu Weixun’s.

342
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,640
We experienced many weird things.

343
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,920
Lu Weixun, the usurer

344
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,480
and I signed

345
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,680
a tripartite contract.

346
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,840
You come to her for the debt every month.

347
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,800
Whatever, there is no way for her

348
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,180
to pay you two million yuan

349
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,540
in one year.

350
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,680
OK.

351
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,240
But

352
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,900
I have a condition.

353
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,160
You have a condition?

354
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,280
I can pay you quarterly,

355
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,970
but she must work for me.

356
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
OK. No problem.

357
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
No problem at all.

358
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,160
I haven’t agreed yet.

359
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,760
Miss.

360
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,720
Do you have any question?

361
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,880
I...

362
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,080
Is it purely

363
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,520
a labor contract?

364
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
Yes, it’s purely a labor contract.

365
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,280
That's it.

366
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,520
I

367
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
have doubts about the work.

368
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,160
No one else would be so kind

369
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,320
to pay debts for you, except a fool, no,

370
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,480
a good man like him.

371
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,880
I'll sign.

372
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,320
I'll sign both.

373
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,400
You promise me

374
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,200
not to go to my home again.

375
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,800
I don’t want my dad involved.

376
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,760
I won’t.

377
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,040
He has no money at all.

378
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,640
So,

379
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
what’s your work?

380
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,600
I keep his sense of taste,

381
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,640
and give it back to him

382
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,400
when it’s necessary.

383
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,960
But the way to give it back is a little bit special.

384
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,000
What is it?

385
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,960
Kiss.

386
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,560
What you said is like a tale.

387
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,720
But I don't believe in tales.

388
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,600
Buzui.

389
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,400
Think about

390
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,960
what I told you today is

391
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,360
I have to kiss Lu Weixun.

392
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,760
How could I say yes?

393
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,480
Buzui.

394
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,330
Happy birthday!

395
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,720
Yong.

396
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,200
What brings you here?

397
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,240
- I...  - He Buzui.

398
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,120
You came back so late.

399
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,080
I’m sorry.

400
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,880
I had something to deal with.

401
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
We’ve been awaiting you for dinner.

402
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,160
You can have dinner first.

403
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,360
No need to wait for me.

404
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,120
Buzui.

405
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,760
He has been bustling around

406
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,820
for your birthday.

407
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,480
You’ll get him upset.

408
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,160
Did you

409
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,560
prepare these for me?

410
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,000
Mr. Lu gave you one day off

411
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,130
so as to prepare your birthday.

412
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,880
You shouldn’t be late.

413
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,200
I’m sorry.

414
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,040
I didn’t mean it.

415
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,130
I’m gonna wash my hands.

416
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,480
Go ahead.

417
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
What happened?

418
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,840
I broke it.

419
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
You broke it! Is this your attitude?

420
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,640
You have no idea what it means to me.

421
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,280
It is just a bottle.

422
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,040
I will buy one for you.

423
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,600
How come you are so mad?

424
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,600
I just want this one!

425
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,640
Are you crazy?

426
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,700
Don't touch me.

427
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,000
Buzui.

428
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,640
You are bleeding.

429
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,320
Lu Weixun.

430
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,220
I’m unlucky to know you

431
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,480
in my life.

432
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,480
People and things come and go

433
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,120
Experienced love and hurt

434
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,000
Pain might be gone

435
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,400
But, the scar is still there

436
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Keep chasing after the desire

437
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,320
It vanished

438
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,080
Can you be yourself again

439
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,120
Love is a reality show

440
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,640
People and things come and go

441
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Experienced…

442
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,880
Why did He Buzui refuse me?

443
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,480
Didn’t she love Yi Beidao very much in those years?

444
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,760
Come. Look here!

445
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
Three, two, one. Say cheese!

446
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,040
Three, two, one!

447
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,320
Cheese!

448
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,800
Good. Let’s take another one.

449
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,440
Three, two, one!

450
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,920
Cheese!

451
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,680
Good!

452
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,120
Buzui.

453
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,440
Beidao.

454
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,240
Which university do you apply for?

455
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
I haven’t decided it.

456
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,820
I wanna choose a university with high scholarship.

457
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,360
I can’t see you any more

458
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,400
when you go to university, can I?

459
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,680
Yes, you can.

460
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,680
Don’t worry.

461
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,600
We can still keep in touch

462
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,920
in university.

463
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,680
I have something to tell you.

464
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,720
Buzui.

465
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,980
Let’s talk about it later.

466
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,600
Mr. Wan.

467
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,720
Buzui.

468
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,600
Why did you come so late?

469
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,440
I come to see your father.

470
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,600
We drank at the dinner time

471
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,980
and chatted until now.

472
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,800
He

473
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,400
did change a lot.

474
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,520
Since he quit drinking,

475
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,000
his memory has been poor.

476
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,800
Maybe because he is old,

477
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,380
he can’t remember things.

478
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,600
He must be very happy

479
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,480
so that he drank with you.

480
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,280
Why did he quit drinking?

481
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,710
Because I had a serious sickness

482
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,120
when I was young.

483
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,230
To cure my sickness,

484
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,080
he sold the winery.

485
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,000
He hasn’t drunk since then.

486
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,360
Is Peer Blossom still brewed?

487
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,150
No.

488
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,150
He said it was ominous.

489
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,190
He liked drinking very much.

490
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
What a pity.

491
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,630
Mr. Wan.

492
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,190
You may often come

493
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
to chat with my father when you’re free.

494
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,170
OK, I will come often to see him.

495
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,670
Buzui.

496
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,280
You are a girl.

497
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,460
It’s not easy for you to work outside.

498
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,290
Come to me if you have any difficulty.

499
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,429
I’ll help you.

500
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,440
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

501
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,940
I’m going home.

502
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,360
OK.

503
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,000
Bye.

504
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,640
Dad.

505
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,880
You are back.

506
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,170
I have finished dinner.

507
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,800
You come back to see me?

508
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
Yeah, I miss you.

509
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,040
You should come back more often.

510
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,920
It was my fault before.

511
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,350
I will accompany you at home every day.

512
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Keep your words.

513
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,480
I encountered Mr. Wan just now.

514
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,920
What did you talk about?

515
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,360
we chatted

516
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,480
about you.

517
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,800
You are an assistant now.

518
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,080
it is only a title

519
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,080
Back then, it was called deputy.

520
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,160
I had a deputy too.

521
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,280
But he got lost.

522
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,600
We were talking if we could

523
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,600
find him back.

524
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,520
If we can find him...

525
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,880
Dad, be careful.

526
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,840
Let me wash the bowls for you.

527
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,800
No need. I can do it.

528
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,860
- Put them here. Let me wash them.  - OK.

529
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,320
The night is long

530
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,700
Hold myself

531
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,160
Let tears run down the face

532
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,120
So I can feel better

533
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,760
I still have the dream

534
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Luckily I had you at that moment

535
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,800
I try to hold back my sadness

536
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,320
Let the wind heal the wound

537
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,680
Whom should I tell my innermost words to

538
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,520
Only I stay in the room

539
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,440
Sit alone

540
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,160
And smile in silence

541
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,000
Pretend to be strong

542
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,960
It will be alright

543
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,840
Tears fill my eyes

544
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,480
While they can’t relief my pain

545
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,440
Like a flower that doesn’t blossom

546
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,680
No one comes to pick it

547
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,360
The time will eventually scar my wounds

548
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,960
I don’t feel pain no matter who touches it

549
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,920
If the bud of my love

550
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:21,320
Will blossom someday

551
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Where is He Buzui?

552
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,840
Didn’t she come back last night?

553
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,560
Why didn’t you

554
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,320
knock on the door before coming in?

555
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,080
I knocked. No one answered me.

556
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,700
And the door is open.

557
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,640
So, I come in.

558
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,800
The door is open for her.

559
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,880
Why not look for her

560
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,330
rather than to wait?

561
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,220
No need.

562
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,360
I know whom she stays with.

563
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,880
Do you know it?

564
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,960
It seems

565
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,220
Yi Beidao is up to no good.

566
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,880
She went out

567
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,200
and dated with him yesterday.

568
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,120
Mr. Lu.

569
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,220
Now that you like He Buzui,

570
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,620
you should do something.

571
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,280
I like her?

572
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,800
She is the girl

573
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,320
I hate the most.

574
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,760
I don’t believe it.

575
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,330
I only care about my sense of taste.

576
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,290
Your sense of taste?

577
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,760
She didn’t come home last night,

578
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,280
and she must have come to her sweetheart.

579
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,700
When they bill and coo,

580
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,280
I wonder

581
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,080
if your sense of taste will...

582
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,520
Mr. Lu.

583
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,120
The bar isn’t open.

584
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
Where is He Buzui?

585
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,080
Why should I tell you?

586
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,400
Mr. Lu.
