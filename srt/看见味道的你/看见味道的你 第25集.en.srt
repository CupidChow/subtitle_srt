1
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,670
I don’t want to do this, either.

2
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,140
I want you and your dad

3
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,480
to live happily for the rest of your life.

4
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,740
But I have no choice.

5
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,020
You remember everything.

6
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,150
I can’t let that happen.

7
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,700
Let my dad go.

8
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,030
He doesn’t remember anything.

9
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,420
You’ll be punished.

10
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,020
Buzui,

11
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,060
it’s not up to you whether I’ll be punished.

12
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,740
You committed so many brutal crimes.

13
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,380
If Wan Zeze finds out,

14
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,380
will he forgive you?

15
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,900
He’ll never find out.

16
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,420
I’ll make sure of it.

17
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,579
My Zeze is so poor!

18
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,020
A sweet boy!

19
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,019
Hello,

20
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,019
plate 87.

21
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,460
I found Wan Ran’s car.

22
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
I’ve got the location.

23
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,660
Be there right away.

24
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,720
Don’t make any move. It’s dangerous.

25
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,390
Sir, step on it, please.

26
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,380
OK.

27
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,220
What do you want to do?

28
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,260
He Buzui!

29
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,580
He Buzui!

30
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,580
He Buzui!

31
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,820
Don’t make any stupid decision.

32
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,620
If I were you,

33
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,940
I’d turn myself in.

34
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,180
Turn myself in?

35
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,180
Hilarious.

36
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,420
You’re so naive.

37
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,540
Zeze needs me.

38
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,700
I can’t be held up in jail.

39
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,390
You think you can get away with this

40
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,380
once you kill all of us?

41
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,420
You won’t.

42
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,620
I’m leaving with Zeze.

43
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,070
We won’t come back anymore.

44
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,740
The truth won’t be concealed.

45
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
If you disappear from the world,

46
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,140
no one would know the truth.

47
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,480
Your conscience would suffer

48
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,300
wherever you run away.

49
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,180
Enough. No more talking.

50
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,380
There’s no time.

51
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Come on.

52
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,820
Here.

53
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,620
Lu Weixun.

54
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,660
He Buzui!

55
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,780
He Buzui!

56
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,220
He Buzui!

57
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,540
Raspberry, blueberry, mint, cedar and black lead.

58
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,580
Keep it for me.

59
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Stay back.

60
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,860
Don’t come any closer.

61
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,060
If you dare to make one more step,

62
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,340
we all die in flame.

63
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,680
Don’t rush to any move.

64
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,700
You’ve got a son.

65
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,100
Think about your son.

66
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,030
Don’t make more mistakes. Wan Ran.

67
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,380
Boy,

68
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,020
let me be honest.

69
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,040
I never wanted to hurt you.

70
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,020
I know

71
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
you’re President Lu’s only son.

72
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,659
But to save this girl, you…

73
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,540
Buzui, Buzui, wake up.

74
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,300
Are you OK?

75
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,340
Save my dad.

76
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,900
OK.

77
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,420
Why is there

78
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,860
- Mr. He.  - so much liquor on the ground?

79
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,460
Is it you who killed my dad?

80
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,280
It’s his fault. He shouldn’t have made the call.

81
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,340
He was in my way.

82
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,860
So you killed him?

83
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,980
Stop.

84
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,710
Let me atone for my dad’s crime.

85
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,100
Dad.

86
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,620
If only you can.

87
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,440
I’ve had enough of the life without a family.

88
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,780
Good boy!

89
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,660
I can’t let anyone

90
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,340
Here.

91
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,040
to suffer from unnecessary loss.

92
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,510
Raise your glasses.

93
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,140
Come on.

94
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,340
Let’s have a toast.

95
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,180
Cheers!

96
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,820
You know how I wish I can kill you?

97
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,500
Though you killed my father,

98
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,220
I won’t kill you.

99
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,070
Because you’re Wan Zeze’s father.

100
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,420
Wait here.

101
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,620
Justice will be served.

102
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,060
And I don’t want Wan Zeze

103
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,260
to suffer what I’ve been through.

104
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,940
Don’t say anything.

105
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,720
Don’t bother explaining.

106
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,500
Let’s face it together, OK?

107
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,660
I’m so sorry.

108
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,180
It’s my fault.

109
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,670
Since you know it’s your fault,

110
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,580
let’s face the consequences

111
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,390
and accept the trial by law.

112
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,180
But in the coming days,

113
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,140
I won’t be there in your life.

114
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,340
I’ll take care of myself.

115
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,880
Do your time in the prison.

116
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,220
Thank you.

117
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,260
For what?

118
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Thank you for protecting yourself.

119
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,520
Take care of yourself.

120
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,500
Dad.

121
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:19,940
Idol.

122
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,340
Idol, you finally wake up.

123
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,140
Are you hungry?

124
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,540
I’ll make something for you.

125
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,380
Xia Fan.

126
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,900
Where is Buzui?

127
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,680
I foresaw that you must have woken up.

128
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,720
I made noodles for you.

129
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,540
Have some.

130
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
It tastes good.

131
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,720
She’s good at cooking now.

132
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
It smells so good.

133
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,620
Thank you, Buzui.

134
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,740
I’ll eat later.

135
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,180
It’s nothing for me.

136
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,540
It’s you

137
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,140
who is injured to save me.

138
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,020
I’m fine.

139
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,050
It’s just a scratch.

140
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,900
He Buzui,

141
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,619
to save you, my idol was hurt

142
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,349
both physically and mentally.

143
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,420
Xia Fan, what do you mean?

144
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,540
Does it make you happy

145
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,569
to see she gets injured?

146
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,380
Look what this is.

147
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,750
She is injured, too.

148
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,140
You should know

149
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,020
if I’m injured,

150
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,780
it only hurts me.

151
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,460
But if Buzui is injured,

152
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,700
she’s not the only one

153
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,260
who is hurt.

154
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,420
So

155
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,860
I’d rather it hurts me.

156
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,220
Zui, look,

157
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,100
he thought

158
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,550
it only hurts him when he gets injured.

159
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,860
He doesn’t know

160
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,080
that it hurts you more.

161
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,500
Be good to Buzui, all right?

162
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,220
Hey,

163
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,350
where is Wan Ran?

164
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,500
He’s been arrested.

165
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,980
Luckily, Wan Zeze and Yi Nanke came on time.

166
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,980
Why is my idol always the one who gets hurt?

167
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,480
It hurts my heart when it occurs to me.

168
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,900
Now it seems

169
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
I’m really your Waterloo.

170
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,700
Since we met, I’ve become the source of your bad luck.

171
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,500
You finally realize you are.

172
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,460
Idol.

173
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,060
Don’t you think you deserve better?

174
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,980
Yes, indeed.

175
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,800
I’m the best you can get, alright?

176
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,460
You’re the best?

177
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,500
You think so?

178
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,340
I’m badly injured.

179
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,940
How are you going to pay for that?

180
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,300
With your life-long companion?

181
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,660
You think you’re the best?

182
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,180
Eat the noodles now.

183
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,710
Let me get it for you.

184
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,120
Try some and see if you like it.

185
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,480
Let me try some.

186
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,700
Delicious.

187
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,230
My cooking really gets better.

188
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,670
What is it you want me out in this windy day?

189
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,700
We have good memories here.

190
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,980
Memories?

191
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,860
Let me see.

192
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,700
Mi Ya,

193
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,460
do you want some candies?

194
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,700
No, I don’t.

195
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,020
No?

196
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,660
Yes, you do.

197
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,260
I don’t.

198
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,700
Why would I want candies?

199
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,740
You do.

200
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,540
I say you do.

201
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,940
You’re so weird.

202
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,180
You make the call for everything,

203
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,300
even about the candies.

204
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,340
I told you I…

205
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,660
What is this?

206
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,900
What do you think?

207
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,420
What does this mean?

208
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,980
What else can it mean?

209
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,100
What’s this?

210
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,100
It means just the same as what in your mind.

211
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,660
Tell me what this is.

212
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,300
You don’t know what it means?

213
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,740
Come on. Let me tell you what it means.

214
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,220
- It means…  - Wait, wait.

215
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,500
Mi Ya!

216
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,980
What?

217
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,220
There was no light in my life.

218
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,100
I thought I sucked.

219
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,860
But since I met you,

220
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,220
I raised hope in my life.

221
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,550
I started to believe that I’m not that bad.

222
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,980
You gave me
hope.

223
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,480
You taught me to smile,

224
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,380
to cherish,

225
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,460
and to love myself.

226
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,100
I wasn’t prepared before.

227
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,220
I thought that you deserved better,

228
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,180
I was afraid you might suffer and get hurt with me.

229
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,220
Now I’m ready.

230
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,220
For the rest of our life, allow me to wait on you.

231
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,660
Marry me.

232
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,460
OK.

233
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,140
Patrick,

234
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,020
what is it that you can’t wait to tell me

235
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,380
until you come back to France

236
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,100
and have to bring me back?

237
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,220
I have to introduce

238
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,860
someone to you in person.

239
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,910
He’s a talented man that could be your colleague.

240
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,060
Miss Bai, how do you do?

241
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,700
I heard you snatched

242
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,430
Buck Winery from Lu Weixun.

243
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,120
Congratulations!

244
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,860
Thank you.

245
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,300
But to be exact,

246
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,380
I won the winery.

247
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,160
Congratulations!

248
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,240
You’re not going to say something for Lu Weixun?

249
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,580
You won it.

250
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,100
What can I say then?

251
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,180
- Cheers!  - Cheers!

252
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,940
Still single?

253
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,220
There can be someone.

254
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,060
I just haven’t met the right person.

255
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,100
It’s said your suitors

256
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,600
have queued up from the Louvre to the Potala.

257
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,340
Yes, but that doesn’t mean I like them all.

258
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,860
I never expected that Patrick

259
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,580
though so highly of you.

260
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,500
He called me back to meet you.

261
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,060
He offered a job sincerely.

262
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,300
Honestly,

263
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,020
I have a slight impulse to take the offer.

264
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,420
What are you waiting for?

265
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,420
Come and be my partner.

266
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,180
I still need a good reason

267
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,540
You’re so weird.

268
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,740
There’s only a handful of people whom Patrick

269
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,540
would offer them positions in WSA.

270
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,940
Well, you don’t cherish this opportunity.

271
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,940
That’s not right.

272
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,420
I have my aspirations.

273
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,700
Thank you.

274
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,220
Thanks.

275
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,380
Rich smell of cream.

276
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,980
The soup is fine and smooth.

277
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,700
The highlight is a few drops of brandy.

278
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,780
This is really delicious.

279
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,870
Tastes good.

280
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,660
But it’s not the best I know.

281
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,540
What is the best then?

282
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,670
The soup made by you.

283
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,580
How are they doing?

284
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,060
Good.

285
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,040
What about you?

286
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,990
Couldn’t be better.

287
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,300
If I give it a second thought, the best time I have

288
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,740
is to see you make a fool of  yourself .

289
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,700
Shocking.

290
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,140
Does my suffering make you happy?

291
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,940
Right?

292
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,680
A smiling tiger you are.

293
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,300
You’re right, Miss Bai.

294
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,140
You gain a prestige on the Internet.

295
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,060
Why do you want to a job

296
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,060
at Dr'Wine?

297
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,820
The salary you can get from us

298
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,780
is way less than

299
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,700
that you make from live show.

300
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,340
My idol used to work here.

301
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,270
I believe he must have chosen you for a reason.

302
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,190
You’re the most obsessed fan I’ve ever known.

303
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,160
I want to become

304
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,940
a brilliant man like my idol.

305
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,380
What now?

306
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,380
I still can’t accept

307
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,320
the fact that he’s our colleague.

308
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,580
You’re not alone with that idea.

309
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,260
I wonder how

310
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,940
he has impressed the editor.

311
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,660
I know.

312
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,980
Tell us.

313
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,860
I overheard at his doorstep.

314
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,460
So that’s how?

315
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,660
Yes.

316
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,580
Why?

317
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,660
I don’t know.

318
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,740
Probably he’s lucky.

319
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,060
What are you looking at?

320
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,220
Nothing. Go on with your comics.

321
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Be good.

322
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,580
Go now.

323
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,700
I miss Mi Ya.

324
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,940
I miss the quietness in the office.

325
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,020
Me. too.

326
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,060
I’m with you.

327
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,180
Mr. He,

328
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,020
it’s been years.

329
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,420
It’s my honor to meet you again.

330
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,980
Yes. We meet again.

331
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,780
Look, we’ve caused

332
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,300
such a trouble for you.

333
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,710
You made so many dishes,

334
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,540
the western ones and the Chinese ones.

335
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,500
We’re flattered.

336
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,960
You’re too polite.

337
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,300
Right.

338
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,180
Mr. Lu,

339
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,230
look what I brought for you.

340
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
Pear Blossom!

341
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,180
Newly-made.

342
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,980
Mr. He, you’re so considerate.

343
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,830
Thank you very much.

344
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,700
You’re welcome.

345
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,260
Weixun,

346
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,380
put it for storage.

347
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,460
Please don’t.

348
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,820
I brought it to share with you.

349
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,340
I’ll send a case over for storage later.

350
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,540
Thank you.

351
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,620
But, Mr. He,

352
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,460
I’ve prepared for this meal

353
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,660
our home-made red wine.

354
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,120
Red wine is not strong enough.

355
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,100
Let’s drink liquor. Liquor is strong.

356
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,540
OK. We drink Pear Blossom today.

357
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,180
Son, get the glasses for liquor.

358
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,100
No need. Let’s stick to the big glasses.

359
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,360
The bigger the glasses are, the merrier.

360
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,340
OK, we use this glass.

361
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,550
- We can have little each time.  - OK.

362
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,580
Here. Help yourself.

363
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,820
Dad,

364
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,300
you’ll get drunk.

365
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,500
I don’t mind though.

366
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,260
Nonsense! When did I ever get drunk?

367
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,700
You know how much I can drink.

368
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,660
Are you kidding?

369
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,180
You can drink some, right?

370
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,740
Mr. He,

371
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,340
our children are engaged today.

372
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,800
Let’s have a hearty drink!

373
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,580
- So bottom up?  - Cheers.

374
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,860
- Cheers!  - Dad.

375
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,380
Come on, raise your glasses.

376
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,440
You take your time.

377
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,320
- Let’s have a glass.  - Cheers!

378
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,460
It’s great!

379
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,260
How is it?

380
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,440
It’s great, right?

381
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,140
Fill in, fill in.

382
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,470
Come on. Another glass.

383
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,560
Come on.

384
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,420
Here.

385
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,820
I need to give you a heads-up.

386
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,380
The way I cope with my parents is kind of weird.

387
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,910
You need time to adapt to it.

388
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,300
I’ll take my time,

389
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,020
since we have a lifetime.

390
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,840
Hey, take this.

391
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,400
That’s all.

392
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,940
All right.

393
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,900
That’s it.

394
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
Are you sure about the resignation?

395
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,460
I don’t like the job at the magazine as an editor.

396
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,700
I like to run a WeChat public account.

397
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,500
And I want to do something I like.

398
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,980
If you’ve made the decision,

399
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,860
just do it.

400
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,620
I can support you even when you don’t make money.

401
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,660
You get a honey tongue now.

402
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,860
I only say honey words to you.

403
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,700
Good. Don’t stop with the words.

404
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,740
Dad, mom, here it is.

405
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,020
Dad, mom.

406
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,200
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mi.

407
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,060
- How do you do?  - Hi!

408
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,540
Dad, mom, this is my boyfriend, Yi Nanke.

409
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
Please be seated.

410
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,420
Take a seat.

411
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,060
OK.

412
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,660
Nanke.

413
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,460
Smells good.

414
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,500
Did you make the dinner?

415
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,710
We made it together.

416
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,780
You must be hungry.

417
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,460
Have some.

418
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,420
- I’m OK.  - Dad.

419
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,360
Be careful.

420
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,820
- I’m OK.  - Let me get you to your room.

421
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
- Go.  - Here.

422
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:06,940
Go…

423
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,860
help your father-in-law.

424
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,340
Dad.

425
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,580
- I told you not to drink too much.  - Mr. Lu,

426
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,540
it’s not healthy to get drunk.

427
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,340
That’s too much.

428
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,460
A little bit too much.

429
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,660
Uncle, it’s late now.

430
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,940
Why don’t you stay at my home for the night?

431
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,000
We have guest room.

432
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,780
Careful.

433
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,780
Uncle.

434
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,700
Don’t worry.

435
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,020
No matter what happens

436
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,300
in the future,

437
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,060
I’ll take care of it for you.

438
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,180
Who makes the call in our home?

439
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,340
That goes without question.

440
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,870
It’s definitely your call.

441
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,420
Dad, listen to me.

442
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,620
Nanke is amazing.

443
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,340
All right. Eat your dinner.

444
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,020
Stupid boy.

445
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,380
Let’s have a toast.

446
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,260
Raise your glasses.

447
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,740
- Come on. - Cheers!

448
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,620
One last glass.

449
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,620
Let’s share it.

450
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,560
Don’t waste it.

451
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,220
Cheers!

452
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,780
The lukewarm liquor tastes better.

453
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,020
Of course.

454
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,980
I begged my dad to make the liquor a year ago.

455
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,590
Newly-made liquor is the best.

456
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,760
Your dad likes winery so much.

457
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,150
Have you thought about resuming the Distillery?

458
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,500
Yes, we have.

459
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,020
It’s my dad’s lifework.

460
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,180
He’s skilled.

461
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,660
Besides,

462
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,420
I don’t want to see liquor so good to disappear.

463
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,190
Whatever you want to do,

464
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,180
you have my support.

465
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,140
In the past,

466
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,060
you would never say such sweet words.

467
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,420
What makes me happier is

468
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,900
that I have my dream, too.

469
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,460
Lu Weixun,

470
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,940
I’m lucky to have you.

471
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
It’s Pear Blossom we just drank.

472
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,780
Do you want to say something to me?

473
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,580
Thanks to Pear Blossom,

474
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,620
we met with each other.

475
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,139
Drink morning coffee

476
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,100
When I’m thinking about you

477
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,340
Close my eyes and enjoy the aftertaste

478
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,699
Didn't sleep at all last night

479
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Worrying that you'd refuse me

480
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,199
A glass of old wine would make me drunk

481
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,020
I relive the past over and over

482
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,220
And start missing you more and more

483
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,940
Give me another chance

484
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,980
To be with you

485
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,020
One in a million chance

486
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,100
To be paired up with you

487
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,580
We're meant to be

488
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,620
It doesn’t take that long.

489
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,380
Let’s check on them.

490
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,740
Go give them a start.

491
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,870
There’s no need.

492
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,540
Hurry up. You guys.

493
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,270
Those dishes are getting cold.

494
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,580
Too much for these two glasses.

495
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,780
What are you boys doing here?

496
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,100
I’m not one of the boys you mentioned.

497
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,420
I’m so happy to be able to spend the New Year’s Eve

498
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,540
with my idol.

499
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,540
Let go.

500
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,100
- Let go.  - Let’s have a drink.

501
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Come on. Let’s have a toast.

502
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,830
Raise your glasses. Bottom up.

503
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,660
Cheers! Cheers!

504
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,000
The wine tastes sweet.

505
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,200
You have your palate back?

506
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,060
It’s recovering.

507
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,900
Lu Weixun’s hysterical ageusia is cured.

508
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020
Both of us will protect our palates.

509
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,420
- Disgusting.  - Come on. One more glass.

510
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,660
- One more.  - One more glass.

511
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,340
Cheers!

512
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,240
Happy New Year!

513
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,820
Happy New Year!

514
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,470
Are you cold?

515
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,540
Gosh, they’re so sweet.

516
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,020
- I can’t stand it.  - I’m cold, too. My hands.

517
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,780
My hands are cold.

518
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,180
Let’s go. I can’t bear it.

519
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,740
Go to Hao Yong.

520
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,420
Move.

521
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,140
Hao Yong!

522
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,100
It’s cold.

523
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,280
Put your hat on.

524
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
Don’t catch cold.

525
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,020
A new year is coming.

526
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,180
Lu Weixun, happy New Year.

527
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,780
It’s a new year.

528
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,790
Do you have any wishes you’d like to share?

529
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,860
All my wishes have come true.

530
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,660
So no more wishes.

531
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,220
Make a wish for the sake of the occasion.

532
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,580
For example,

533
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,580
a wish to spend the rest of our lives together.

534
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,700
You’re so different from other girls.

535
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,940
I don’t even know what to do to please you.

536
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,820
You’ve made me so pleased.

537
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,260
I know.

538
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,100
You want to trick me

539
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,480
into proposing to you?

540
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,720
How can I ask my girl

541
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,860
to make the proposal?

542
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,820
All that’s yours is mine.

543
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,780
And all that’s mine is mine, too.

544
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,190
All we have is yours.

545
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,020
The last year

546
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,620
is full of bitterness

547
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,040
and sweetness of life.

548
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,380
I lost my palate and regained it.

549
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Every day is like riding a roller coaster.

550
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,820
Though the ups and downs,

551
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,260
Lu Weixun and I never gave up on ourselves

552
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,020
nor on each other.

553
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,100
It’s diagnosed

554
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,700
that the loss of my palate

555
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,580
is due to damage caused by

556
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,710
drowning in the liquor barrel.

557
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,340
But luckily,

558
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,580
I have the Pear Blossom with zinc

559
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,540
and my dad’s love.

560
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,340
And I have him.

561
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,700
Lu Weixun’s hysterical ageusia

562
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,220
has been cured.

563
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,660
He said thank god

564
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,300
to bring me in his life that evening,

565
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,300
so we can share the miraculous journey

566
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,940
in search of flavors.

567
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,020
So we can meet

568
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,140
and become the best forms of ourselves.

569
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,700
We’re getting married.

570
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,060
Yes. We’re getting married.

571
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,940
We wander in the autumn

572
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,220
Your profile is so handsome at sunset

573
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,900
Raise head and see your tender eyes

574
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,860
It makes my heartbeat accelerate

575
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,300
The feeling to be with you is so special

576
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,540
You make me feel so warm

577
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,260
Move on and be brave

578
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,380
We can be more than just friends

579
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,740
When you say hi, my girl

580
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,100
Want to hear you say you need me

581
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,500
Don’t want to hide or have regrets
