1
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,020
Thanks for your breakfast.

2
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,020
I’ll wash the dishes.

3
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,580
I need to go out.

4
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,820
You're off today

5
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,150
and can rest at home.

6
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,340
I don’t need rest.

7
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,180
Be good.

8
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,280
Have some rest.

9
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,980
Dude,

10
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,140
we can talk it out.

11
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,060
This is unnecessary.

12
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,620
We can talk.

13
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,220
De,

14
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,220
we’re buddies.

15
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,620
No need to do this, right?

16
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,579
How rude!

17
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,780
Yes, right.

18
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:49,940
De,

19
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,350
what...what are you doing? De?

20
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,340
Don’t do this. Please!

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,140
So,

22
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,420
when will you pay me back?

23
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,150
I'm so sorry.

24
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,100
Give me a month.

25
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,140
That’s all I’m asking for.

26
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,740
I swear I’ll pay you back.

27
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,580
One month?

28
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,860
Two weeks. Two weeks are enough!

29
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,340
Two...two weeks?

30
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,100
One week.

31
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,540
Excuse me?

32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,980
One week. Seven days.

33
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,300
I’ll give you the money back.

34
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,140
Sure, we’re buddies.

35
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,310
Don’t catch him.

36
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,190
Let go of him.

37
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,820
Come here.

38
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,140
Sit. Have a cup of tea.

39
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,579
Bad news, Mi Ya!

40
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,760
Investigator from WSA Headquarters is coming.

41
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,340
It’s doomed to happen.

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,700
Who is the investigator?

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,020
Someone named Bai Jing.

44
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,500
Bai Jing?

45
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,060
OK, I see.

46
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,060
What’s the price of this wine in China?

47
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,340
About 280 Yuan.

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,620
OK.

49
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,300
It’s good.

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,500
Jessie.

51
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Hey, Patrick. What brings you here?

52
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,260
I came to attend a conference

53
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,810
and I’d like to know more

54
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,339
about Lu’s case in China.

55
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,020
I know about it.

56
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,300
I trust him.

57
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,580
So are you going to...

58
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,540
Of course I’ll go.

59
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,100
You and Lu are so close.

60
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,740
I’m afraid investigation result is unconvincing.

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,220
You know what I mean?

62
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,020
What?

63
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,580
Don’t you trust me?

64
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,500
I do.

65
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,140
I trust both of you.

66
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,740
So the board doesn’t trust me?

67
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,500
The board thinks the same as me.

68
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,340
They don’t doubt you at all.

69
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,900
This file came this morning.

70
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,820
Here.

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,060
Don’t worry.

72
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,780
My professionalism is beyond doubt.

73
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,940
Bye.

74
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,940
Buzui.

75
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,620
Buzui.

76
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,260
Superhero,

77
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,340
who are you looking for?

78
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,940
He Buzui.

79
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Who sent you here?

80
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,100
My idol.

81
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
I don’t care who she is.

82
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,870
I only listen to my idol.

83
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,140
I believe he sent me here

84
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,380
for a reason.

85
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,020
Mr. Lu is so caring.

86
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,900
This task I was given

87
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,220
is rather difficult.

88
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,140
To cheer up a sad person,

89
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,780
I can only think of

90
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,420
Iron Man.

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,580
Let me see.

92
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:04,900
So?

93
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,940
Awesome, huh?

94
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,680
Not too bad.

95
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,740
Buzui,

96
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,140
I brought you a superhero, Iron Man.

97
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,780
This is what we're striving to achieve.

98
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,310
Lu Weixun sent you here, didn’t he?

99
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,700
Sit.

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,300
Buzui.

101
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,740
He Buzui, behold.

102
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,100
Be quiet.

103
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,540
Will that cheer her up?

104
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,620
Use your brain for once!

105
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,280
Will she be rejoiced by noise?

106
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,060
She was fine just now.

107
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,380
You upset her by asking her

108
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,310
why she’s upset.

109
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,500
One more word, I’ll kick you out.

110
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,980
Who do you think you are?

111
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,300
My idol sent me here.

112
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,540
- Get the hell out!  - You...

113
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,260
Don't push me.

114
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,190
Leave. He Buzui,

115
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,700
- I can help you...  - Leave now.

116
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,660
Don’t push me.

117
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,380
So rude.

118
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,300
Lu Weixun sent me here.

119
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,820
Mr. Lu.

120
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,670
Where is she?

121
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,420
Weird.

122
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,860
She was here just now.

123
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,060
It’s going to be dark soon.

124
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,220
We must find her as soon as possible.

125
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,780
Yes.

126
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,390
Let’s go.

127
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,020
Guess who I am.

128
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,660
Hi, my fiancé.

129
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,960
I told you a million times.

130
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,530
I’m not your fiancé.

131
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,860
Long time no see.

132
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Don’t you miss me?

133
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,820
Hottie,

134
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,240
give me a smile.

135
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,340
No?

136
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,420
I can give you a smile.

137
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,420
Why did he send you here?

138
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,860
My boss asked me

139
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,180
to eat and chat with you

140
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,160
and said he’d pay me salary

141
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,140
with a bonus.

142
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,940
You’re downhearted.

143
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,820
Who are you cosplaying?

144
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,380
That fierce and confident He Buzui

145
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,020
isn’t like this.

146
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,060
So what do you think He Buzui

147
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,900
is like?

148
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,060
She prefers fists

149
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,540
than words.

150
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,740
Buzui,

151
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,500
don’t cry. Please!

152
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,900
What’s bothering you?

153
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,700
You’re making me upset, too.

154
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,660
Is it because of Yi Beidao?

155
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
He’s changed.

156
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,660
He’s different.

157
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
He cheated on you?

158
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,100
I no longer recognize him.

159
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,820
He’s scary

160
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,300
and strange.

161
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,060
Look at you,

162
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,900
crying like a baby.

163
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,700
Lu Weixun,

164
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,780
I’m here

165
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,980
on behalf of WSA

166
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,740
to investigate you running Muunas Winery

167
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,020
while serving as the sommelier.

168
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,460
If evidence suggests your misconduct,

169
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,630
association will give severe punishment on you.

170
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,260
I’ll cooperate with the investigation of WSA.

171
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,020
These are

172
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,060
the wine lists and the prices

173
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,380
since I took over Muunas Winery.

174
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,520
Thank you Mr.Ma

175
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,900
I only write for Dr'Wine.

176
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,700
You can find

177
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,380
all my articles.

178
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,780
And these

179
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,780
are the video clips of me in public.

180
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,630
Feel free to watch them.

181
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,950
You have everything prepared.

182
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,860
Good job, fiancé.

183
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,100
First,

184
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,060
I’m not your fiancé.

185
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,320
Don’t make me say it again.

186
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,060
Second,

187
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,790
I did purchase Muunas Winery secretly

188
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,900
for a reason.

189
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,540
I’m sorry for the mistakes I made

190
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,430
and I’m sorry I let others down.

191
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,300
Don’t worry.

192
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,900
Leave it to me.

193
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,940
The Yi Beidao I knew

194
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,500
was outgoing,

195
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,220
kindhearted.

196
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,380
He could always

197
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,900
give me energy.

198
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,350
Whenever I was with him,

199
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,100
I’d have no fear.

200
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,820
But the man I see now...

201
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,660
I wish I didn’t meet him.

202
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,900
I wish I could just disappear.

203
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,260
I wish...

204
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,420
I wish I could just disappear.

205
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,380
Don’t say that.

206
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,740
Come on.

207
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,560
Don’t even think about it.

208
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,220
I wish I didn’t meet him.

209
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,500
Finally,

210
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
you’re back.

211
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,200
Why are you not inside ?

212
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,700
I was kicked out.

213
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,940
What’s wrong?

214
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,830
She’s crying because of Yi Beidao.

215
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,620
I know it.

216
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,260
Thanks for coming.

217
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,120
You can go back.

218
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,020
But...

219
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,100
Cheer up!

220
00:14:59,580 --> 00:14:59,940
Here,

221
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,700
stand up.

222
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,080
Don’t touch me.

223
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,640
I don’t want to hear it.

224
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,060
Buzui,

225
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,660
wake up!

226
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,700
I am awake.

227
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,820
Without me,

228
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,200
everything would be fine.

229
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,860
I’m nothing

230
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,020
but a jinx

231
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,220
to you and Yi Beidao.

232
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,660
Don’t say that.

233
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,020
I don’t want to face all this.

234
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,620
I want to run away,

235
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,140
but I just can’t.

236
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,060
Lu Weixun,

237
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,860
Now I’m

238
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,020
such a mess, aren’t I?

239
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,440
No, you are not.

240
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,300
I also want to run away.

241
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,260
Do you want to be with me?

242
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,900
I want to go to the beach.

243
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,910
The weather is good.

244
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,620
You should

245
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,580
go out and bask in the sunshine

246
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,340
for calcium supplement.

247
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,220
The wind is salty.

248
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,620
When I was in need of help,

249
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,660
he gave me a hand.

250
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,260
When I was desperate,

251
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,180
he taught me to be tough.

252
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,300
Without him,

253
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,920
I wouldn’t become who I am now.

254
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,540
This is a nightmare.

255
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,280
It’ll be over eventually.

256
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
You told me to pull myself together,

257
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,940
now,

258
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,700
you should do the same.

259
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,800
Had I known you do this,

260
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,580
I wouldn’t have come to play with you.

261
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,500
No way.

262
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,900
This is the least thing

263
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,660
you should do for me.

264
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,340
Hello,

265
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,060
fairies.

266
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
Good evening.

267
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,420
Welcome to my channel.

268
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,260
Fairies,

269
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,940
today, I’m still gonna help you

270
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,820
taste the earthly world.

271
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,900
Let me introduce you

272
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,420
my friend.

273
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,820
Hao Yong, here.

274
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,070
Say hi to everyone in the live room.

275
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,020
Hello, everyone.

276
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
OK, fine.

277
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Now you know him,

278
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,900
let me introduce

279
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,180
this place I’m in.

280
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,900
It’s new for house parties.

281
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,420
Are you excited?

282
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,540
Thank you for your flower, Yulin.

283
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,580
Love you!

284
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,100
Thanks for your yacht, Junjun baby.

285
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,460
Two kisses for you. Love you!

286
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,980
Fairy Xia Fan,

287
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,180
are we going to play games or not?

288
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,900
That’s all for today.

289
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,390
I’m going to play games.

290
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,500
I’m not a game anchor.

291
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,420
Alright.

292
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,220
See you later.

293
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,980
Bye.

294
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,980
My ID is Fairy’s Man Xia Fan.

295
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,740
I’m no fairy.

296
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,500
I’m a true man.

297
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,260
Hey,

298
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,120
are all online celebrities like you?

299
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,340
Aren’t you tired?

300
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,260
I am,

301
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,260
but no job is easy.

302
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,880
You know the saying

303
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,980
every trade has its master.

304
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,420
I want to be like my idol,

305
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,670
striving for the best in one field.

306
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,340
Looks like

307
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,920
you aren’t too stupid.

308
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,500
You’re stupid.

309
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,220
How can a common fellow read the mind of a great man?

310
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,540
I’m ambitious.

311
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,180
Cool!

312
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,820
What?

313
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,980
Dr'Wine is ridiculous!

314
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,740
What’s wrong?

315
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,180
What...

316
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,060
What happened?

317
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,380
Hao Yong,

318
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,780
what’s up?

319
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,500
Check Weibo.

320
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,340
It’s a mess!

321
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,990
What’s going on?

322
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,540
See it yourself.

323
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,900
Boss,

324
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
what should we do?

325
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,520
Do we need to do something?

326
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,060
No need.

327
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,200
Nothing at all?

328
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,260
WSA is investigating it.

329
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,860
I believe they’ll handle it fairly.

330
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,860
And,

331
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,740
it’s the whole team’s decision.

332
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,310
Don’t hurt anyone..

333
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,620
But they’re throwing you under the bus.

334
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,940
That’s outrageous.

335
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,740
It’s my call.

336
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,140
Fine.

337
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,180
I don’t quite understand it,

338
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,980
but I support you no matter what.

339
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,520
How is He Buzui?

340
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,820
She’s stable now

341
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,240
and resting in bed.

342
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,540
Take good care of her.

343
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,260
You do care about her.

344
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,780
We...we’re friends.

345
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,300
It’s understandable what the company does

346
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,020
but this claim is inhumane.

347
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:17,940
Sit.

348
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,640
Tastes bitter.

349
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,900
Mi Ya,

350
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,940
I only did this

351
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,470
to prevent confrontations like this.

352
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,780
Personally,

353
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,560
I didn’t agree with it,

354
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,340
but professionally,

355
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,260
it must be done.

356
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,390
Money matters more than anything?

357
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,180
Yes.

358
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,740
Without it,

359
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,900
we’ll both be dead.

360
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,120
That’s why I had to do this.

361
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,260
Hope you can understand me.

362
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,000
You’re Mu Chunfeng’s editor.

363
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,400
Go back to work.

364
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,740
Someone is in bad luck these days.

365
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,150
I never run away from anything.

366
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,140
Let it come.

367
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,900
I can handle it.

368
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,660
This is No.59.

369
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,640
16 barrels were produced.

370
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
14 were sold.

371
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,780
2 are left.

372
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,420
Totally 600 bottles

373
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,500
are all here.

374
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,940
I’d like to see

375
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,220
the controversial, No.92 first.

376
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
This way, please.

377
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,100
It was stored

378
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
right here.

379
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,750
They’ve all been destroyed

380
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,360
following Mr. Lu’s order.

381
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,460
Indeed.

382
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,500
It’s all gone.

383
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,700
Yes.

384
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,510
All been destroyed.

385
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,070
That was a huge price to pay.

386
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,750
We tried to persuade Mr. Lu,

387
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,780
but he insisted on doing that.

388
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,420
As a sommelier,

389
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,260
you’re a man of your word

390
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,540
and able to keep what’s most precious to you.

391
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,980
I hope you’ll do the same

392
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,140
in terms of other things.

393
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,660
Would you like to see other places?

394
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,120
Let’s go check over there.

395
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
This way, please.

396
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,100
This is No.17.

397
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,180
And this one...

398
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,460
Sister.

399
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
What are you doing here?

400
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,500
Sister, help!

401
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,900
What now?

402
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,260
Give me 100,000 yuan.

403
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,060
100,000 yuan?

404
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,420
No.

405
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,070
Listen, sister,

406
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,070
they’ll kill me if I don't pay them.

407
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,460
Who wants to kill you?

408
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,630
Loan sharks.

409
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,900
You borrowed money from them?

410
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,340
What for?

411
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,300
I...I...

412
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,390
I borrowed money

413
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,220
I borrowed money to do business.

414
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
What business?

415
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,100
You gambled again?

416
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,220
No.

417
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
Tell me the truth!

418
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,620
I...

419
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,180
I could’ve won,

420
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,100
but lost it.

421
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Alright, enough.

422
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,340
Go ask your mom. I can’t help you.

423
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:45,740
I...

424
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,700
Sister,

425
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,460
you must help me!

426
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,100
Mi Ya!

427
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:15,820
OK,

428
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,120
the account has been audited.

429
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,340
On behalf of WSA,

430
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
I’ll announce the verdict.

431
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,220
Lu Weixun,

432
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,620
you running Muunas Winery

433
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,740
while serving as the sommelier

434
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,270
impaired our credibility,

435
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,020
destroyed the industry’s

436
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,350
reputation, and violated our standards,

437
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,180
thus, you’ll be permanently expelled from WSA

438
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,880
and won’t be hired ever again.

439
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,060
Objections?

440
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,220
Yes.

441
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,900
Besides,

442
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,480
after investigation,

443
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,180
we found that

444
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,660
you didn’t abuse your power

445
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,100
to gain benefits for your winery.

446
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,020
Although you violated the code of conduct,

447
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,100
you abide by professional ethics,

448
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,980
so WSA doesn’t acknowledge

449
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,100
Dr'Wine’s lawsuit.

450
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,140
Also,

451
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,900
your wine is allowed to enter the European market.

452
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,700
You spoke for me?

453
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,100
It’s the board’s unanimous decision.

454
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,740
I simply did my job.

455
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,740
By the way,

456
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,740
do you know Wine Consultant?

457
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,100
Never heard of it.

458
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,020
The public account

459
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,860
write several articles about you.

460
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,060
They’re professional, objective,

461
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,500
and incisive.

462
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,900
Those articles provide

463
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,140
information for our investigation.

464
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,700
You speak highly of them.

465
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,710
Those articles must be well-written.

466
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,300
This incident of yours

467
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,740
is widely spread.

468
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,620
I’m curious to know

469
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,420
who knows you so much

470
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,340
that can describe your incident so vividly

471
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
without bias.

472
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,540
Are you saying

473
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,670
I have to thank the public account?

474
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
I think you should,

475
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,100
but the one who you should thank the most

476
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,340
is me.

477
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,220
Sure.

478
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,900
Thank you for everything.

479
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,190
You’ve changed.

480
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,700
How?

481
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,980
You’ve become more thoughtful.

482
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,340
I’m not.

483
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,990
Don’t overthink it.

484
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,980
My work is finally done.

485
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,220
Weixun,

486
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,340
I’m hungry.

487
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,820
I’ll ask the chef to cook something.

488
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,060
No.

489
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,500
Chefs here can only cook Western cuisine.

490
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,740
I've had enough.

491
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,500
I want to eat crabs you cook.

492
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,560
There are many crab restaurants.

493
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,120
Mr. Ma can drive you there.

494
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,060
Seriously?

495
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,500
Now I’m useless to you?

496
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,350
What are you talking about?

497
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,540
Cook crabs for me.

498
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,350
Let’s go.

499
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,500
You can go with Mr. Ma.

500
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,060
We’re almost home.

501
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Let’s eat at home.

502
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,700
Come on.

503
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,260
Weixun,

504
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,670
- wait me.  - You’re back.

505
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Who are you?

506
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,780
He Buzui.

507
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,950
Lu Weixun’s assistant.

508
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,540
What’s your assistant doing here?

509
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,550
House-keeping.

510
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,910
This is Bai Jing,

511
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,740
WSA’s investigator.

512
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,740
Not just that.

513
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,020
I’m also Weixun’s fiancée.

514
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,780
Bai Jing,

515
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,820
stop it.

516
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,700
What? I am.

517
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,100
You brought back crabs?

518
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,340
Let me clean them.

519
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,180
I’ll help her.

520
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,240
- Give me. I’ll do it.  - Here’s a small one.

521
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,900
So scary.

522
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,700
What’s wrong?

523
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,820
Are you hurt?

524
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Weixun,

525
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,340
I got hurt, OK?

526
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,580
Ouch!

527
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Look, this is a kitchen.

528
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,380
You can’t cook.

529
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,070
It’s dangerous for you.

530
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,980
I don’t care. Blow it.

531
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,740
Do it.

532
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,940
Please.

533
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,500
What a miracle!

534
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,620
The pain is gone.

535
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,060
You two can leave.

536
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,740
I’ll cook.

537
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,340
OK.

538
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,220
Be careful.

539
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,900
Have an orange.

540
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:23,740
Here.

541
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,420
It’s hot.

542
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,700
Sit.

543
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,660
Sit here.

544
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,060
I think

545
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,460
only wine is

546
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,420
the perfect match for such a romantic night.

547
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,260
Am I right?

548
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,360
Crabs should go with Shaoxing Rice wine.

549
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,620
Cheesy!

550
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,460
Since you're my fiancé’s assistant,

551
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,900
I need to know

552
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,100
if you’re qualified for the job.

553
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,460
In recent years,

554
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,100
which year is the golden year for wine?

555
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,740
1997.

556
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,620
7 wine regions in France and Italy were all good.

557
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,500
In the next 5 years,

558
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,940
what are the 5 main produce of the 7 regions?

559
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,260
Tell me the year and the region.

560
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,100
Rhone in 1998.

561
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,540
1999 Burgundy in 1999.

562
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,180
Bordeaux and Burgundy in 2000.

563
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,140
Is the main produce of Burgundy

564
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,700
in 1999 and 2000

565
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
red wine or white wine?

566
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,380
White.

567
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
You don’t know?

568
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,830
Ignorance isn’t bliss.

569
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,540
Honey,

570
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,100
we should drink

571
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,620
Chassagne-Montrachet Blanc 2000

572
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
with the crabs.

573
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,320
The Chinese medical book says

574
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,740
Crabs

575
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,220
are salty and cold.

576
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Shaoxing Rice wine is bitter and mild.

577
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,780
It can drive off coldness,

578
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,660
especially good for women.

579
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,980
Crabs should go with it

580
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,460
to maintain the balance,

581
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,980
or you may have diarrhea.

582
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,540
You won’t feel well

583
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,690
and neither others do.

584
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,739
Shaoxing Rice Wine is the cheapest choice.

585
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,170
It doesn’t deserve to be on my table.

586
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,139
Actually, it can date back to 4,000 years ago.

587
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,860
Shaoxing Rice Wine, beer, and wine

588
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,120
are the three ancient wines in the world.

589
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,900
China is home to

590
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,420
and the main producing area of Shaoxing Rice Wine.

591
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,130
Now that you’re back in China,

592
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,989
you should do what the Chinese do.

593
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,060
Eating crabs with white wine

594
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,580
is absurd.

595
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,900
Weixun, you heard that?

596
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,940
The wine is heated.

597
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:49,130
Try it yourself before making comments.

598
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,420
You’ve also been trained by WSA.

599
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,860
Don’t undervalue

600
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
any wine.

601
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,460
Right?

602
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,420
Since you poured it for me,

603
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,340
I’ll taste it.

604
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,300
Is it good?

605
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,580
Not too bad.

606
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,740
Weixun,

607
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:24,980
here.

608
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,030
Chief Editor

609
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,100
Mi Ya,

610
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,940
I always trusted you

611
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,500
but I saw

612
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,500
the news our competitor

613
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,360
just released.

614
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,700
Now I feel

615
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,900
you betrayed

616
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,740
my trust.

617
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,600
What’s the news about?

618
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
You are running the public account

619
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,200
Wine Consultant, aren’t you?

620
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,460
I can tell

621
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,380
you wrote the articles.

622
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,940
Yes.

623
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,020
I wrote them.

624
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,380
Most of your articles

625
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,180
are about Lu Weixun, am I right?

626
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,220
Yes.

627
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,790
What were you thinking?

628
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,460
Tell me, Mi Ya!

629
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,300
Your action is irresponsible

630
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
and a betrayal of the whole company!

631
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,500
He’s in rage!

632
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,820
So terrifying!

633
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,900
I just came back.

634
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,100
What’s going on?

635
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,800
What happened to Mi Ya?

636
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,060
Look,

637
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
our competitor just released this.

638
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,100
What is it?

639
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,340
Dr'Wine’s editor is a hypocrite

640
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,420
who writes comments about Lu Weixun

641
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,500
on her public account

642
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,540
while working as his editor.

643
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,860
Gosh!

644
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,860
Mi Ya did that?

645
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,820
Impossible.

646
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,620
Don't know.

647
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,740
Which public account?

648
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,140
Wine Consultant.

649
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,220
I followed it.

650
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Me too.

651
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,460
Same here.

652
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,060
So did I.

653
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,900
Well, it’s understandable.

654
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,620
That’s Lu Weixun!

655
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,500
She does need a channel

656
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,780
to vent her anger,

657
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,140
or she’d be crazy.

658
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,460
Not exactly.

659
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Her articles are pretty objective,

660
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,820
vivid and more comprehensive.

661
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,020
The content isn’t all praising or criticizing him.

662
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,980
It’s readable.

663
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,340
I’m sorry

664
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,980
but that’s my right.

665
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,860
Instead of being an editor,

666
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,940
I wrote them as a netizen

667
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,460
Without

668
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,460
any bias.

669
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,990
I didn't do anything wrong.

670
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,220
Honestly,

671
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,220
I like that public account.

672
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,220
Mr. Mu.

673
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,910
What’s happening here?

674
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,060
Well...

675
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,020
I’ll go check.

676
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,900
I’m sorry if my articles

677
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,740
caused loss to the company.

678
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,780
I’ll quit my job.

679
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,580
Excuse me.

680
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,900
Mr. Mu.

681
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,060
My editor is quitting?

682
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,860
That’s upsetting.

683
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,220
Mi Ya,

684
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,840
your work hasn’t done yet.

685
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,900
If you quit now,

686
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,580
everyone will be affected by it.

687
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,660
Delete your public account.

688
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:46,870
Go ahead.

689
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,380
Back to work.

690
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,620
Sorry, you have to see this.

691
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,750
Please, have a seat.

692
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,460
It seems

693
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,700
you value your account

694
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,940
more than your job.

695
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,080
I helped you the wrong way.

696
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,940
Editing the magazine is my job.

697
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,600
Writing for my account is a hobby.

698
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,260
My hobby has already

699
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,500
affected my job,

700
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,430
so I do need to make up for it.

701
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,620
Do you feel pitiful?

702
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,300
Yes ,

703
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,870
but I need to take the consequence.

704
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,700
Now I know

705
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,860
why Lu Weixun

706
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,790
can cooperate with you for so long.

707
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,300
A week has passed.

708
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,180
Where’s the money?

709
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,860
I...I’m working on it.

710
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,910
I am, I swear, De.

711
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,580
Give me everything you have.

712
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

713
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
My...my sister has it.

714
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,900
I need to go see her.

715
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,840
Not bother.

716
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,300
I know her address.

717
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:19,980
I’ll go there myself.

718
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,460
No, don’t, De.

719
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,380
Don’t go.

720
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,660
My sister has a temper.

721
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,980
Don’t let her offend you.

722
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,940
That’s not good.

723
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,820
I’ll go.

724
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,700
OK?

725
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,940
Well,

726
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,700
I should go straight

727
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,940
to her instead of you.

728
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,660
She’s a white-collar editor,

729
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,740
a beauty.

730
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,460
I bet she can earn

731
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,500
more money than you

732
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,220
by working in my casino.

733
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:43,980
No, no, no.

734
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,700
De,

735
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,340
I...

736
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,500
I can go to my brother-in-law

737
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,580
and ask him for money.

738
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,540
He’s rich,

739
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,500
extremely loaded.

740
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,380
He owns a bar.

741
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,020
Let me go see him alone.

742
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,500
He’s a gangster,

743
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,300
hotheaded and scrappy.

744
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,300
Let me go see him.

745
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,380
He...a gangster?

746
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
Fine, fine, fine.

747
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,260
You know,

748
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,980
I have a heart of gold.

749
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,940
I’ll give you one more day.

750
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,580
Bring me the money

751
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,020
tomorrow at this hour.

752
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,700
If not,

753
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,580
I’ll take your sister.

754
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,300
No matter how much you pay me,

755
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,100
she’ll have to sleep with me first.

756
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,960
Suit yourself.

757
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,100
Think about it.

758
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,660
Crap! I’m doomed.

759
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,060
[Bai]

760
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,700
Hi, Bai.

761
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,260
What?
