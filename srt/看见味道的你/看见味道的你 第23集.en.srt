1
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,060
We left my idol alone at home.

2
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,979
What if Mu Chunfeng bullies him?

3
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,979
Besides,

4
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,100
who would go out

5
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,660
for buying vegetables and foods in a drizzle?

6
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,789
What is your idol gonna eat if we don’t?

7
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,460
You’re going to cook?

8
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,060
It’s quite obvious.

9
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,539
With my idol?

10
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,100
What do you think?

11
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,380
Then I have to come for dinner.

12
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,180
Hey, allow me.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
Too heavy for you.

14
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,020
Good boy.

15
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,870
Miss He, Mr. Lu wants to see you.

16
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,140
Who are you?

17
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,100
Mr. Lu?

18
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,300
Which one are you referring to?

19
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,139
In this world,

20
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,300
I only know one Mr. Lu, which is my idol.

21
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,780
If you don’t make it clear,

22
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,740
I’ll call the police.

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,000
Mr. Lu Linong, President of the Lu Group.

24
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,220
Xia Fan,

25
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,740
you go back home.

26
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,900
Let’s go.

27
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,630
Where’s the annoying Mu Chunfeng?

28
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,820
He left.

29
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,660
How come you’re alone?

30
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
Where’s He Buzui?

31
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,270
She’s abducted.

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,700
Abducted?

33
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,820
By who?

34
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,820
What does that mean?

35
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,820
It’s not some stranger.

36
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,780
It’s your dad.

37
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,740
Here. Have some tea.

38
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

39
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,460
You’re with Lu Weixun now?

40
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,500
Yes.

41
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,340
It’s not that easy to maintain a relationship

42
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,940
with the heir to the Lu Group.

43
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,500
Actually, it’s not easy to get along with anyone.

44
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,660
Lu Weixun is not the worst.

45
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,019
You really think so?

46
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,620
Not from the start,

47
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,380
but it gets easier and easier.

48
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,180
He’s a double-faced kid.

49
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,480
It’s said you’re the heir to He Wine Distillery.

50
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,740
Mr. Lu, you know He Wine Distillery?

51
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
Your dad’s Pear Blossom

52
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,220
makes people addicted.

53
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,310
You know Pear Blossom, too?

54
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Do you know what happened that year?

55
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,660
That year?

56
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,580
No.

57
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,060
What do you want?

58
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,820
What?

59
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,980
I can’t talk to your wife-to-be?

60
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,980
Listen. I’m not you.

61
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,840
I’ll take good care of her.

62
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,820
Are you done?

63
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,030
If you are, I’m taking her back.

64
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,540
Mr. Lu,

65
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,940
good seeing you.

66
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,500
I’ll visit you in another day.

67
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,260
Bye, Mr. Lu.

68
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Bye.

69
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,380
Dummy.

70
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,180
What did he say to you?

71
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,710
Nothing particularly.

72
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,900
We just talked about you’re easy-going.

73
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,940
Your dad knows about Pear Blossom, too, right?

74
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,660
really?

75
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,060
But I continued to ask a few questions,

76
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,590
he was reluctant to answer.

77
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,940
Do you think he knows something?

78
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,500
I’m not close to him.

79
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,420
You can ask him next time you meet.

80
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,940
What’s up?

81
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,380
You’re implying something.

82
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,830
Nothing. You’re thinking too much

83
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,300
We’ve compared the DNA you brought in last time

84
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,900
with that we found in the body at the Distillery.

85
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,780
We can confirm

86
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,310
it’s your father who was missing 20 years ago.

87
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,220
We’re getting evidence to narrow down the killer.

88
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,380
Beidao,

89
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,460
forgive me.

90
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,260
I can’t live the life you wish I can.

91
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,580
There’s something I have to do.

92
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,980
Hello, mom.

93
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,700
Mi Di told me

94
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,820
you’re dating with a bar owner.

95
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,260
Have you lost your mind?

96
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,140
You don’t know what your father is like?

97
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,070
You want to end up divorced like me?

98
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,700
How much money can a bar owner make?

99
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,140
His name is…

100
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,580
is Yi Beidao, right?

101
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,740
I know you young people

102
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,180
value freedom, feelings or love.

103
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,460
But they’re all useless.

104
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,260
You know?

105
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,380
Listen to me.

106
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,180
Break up with him immediately.

107
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Don’t waste your time with him.

108
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,980
Do you hear me?

109
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,740
Mom,

110
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,700
his name is not Yi Beidao, but Yi Nanke.

111
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,440
I’m talking to you.

112
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,280
Leave me alone.

113
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,620
Hey,

114
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,020
can we have a nice peaceful talk, Mi Ya?

115
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,080
Why do you have to lay your hands on me?

116
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,980
You’re quite at leisure playing games.

117
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,820
I’m not.

118
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,380
I’m busy, OK?

119
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,300
Did you tell mom about me?

120
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,060
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

121
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,500
You can’t fool me.

122
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,380
All she cares is you, her son.

123
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,620
She forgets she has a daughter.

124
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,750
How did she know if you didn’t tell her?

125
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,740
Wait. It’s just your relationship.

126
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,820
Maybe I spoke of it once.

127
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,500
Anyway,

128
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,380
even I didn’t, she’ll find out sooner or later.

129
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,860
What’s it with you?

130
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,500
All right. I’m wrong.

131
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Listen to me.

132
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,020
If you run your mouth about me again,

133
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,100
it won’t be me to deal with you.

134
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,300
It will be my brother-in-law.

135
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,540
I got it, OK?

136
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,790
What did you say?

137
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,100
Nothing.

138
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,790
Don’t you think you should go home?

139
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,060
Are you done?

140
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,350
I’m telling you.

141
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,700
Before you find a new job,

142
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,380
stay at home.

143
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,660
Don’t make troubles for me.

144
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,430
Got it. Don’t worry.

145
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,550
I won’t cause any trouble for you, my dear sister.

146
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,180
Ask me out in a drizzling day?

147
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,420
Is that a test?

148
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
It’s been long

149
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,270
since the last time I asked you out.

150
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,670
What does that mean?

151
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,670
Buy you some drinks.

152
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,860
Looks big.

153
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,460
Liquor?

154
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,550
You think I won’t get drunk?

155
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,880
Are you afraid?

156
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,380
No.

157
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,440
What are the rules? We just drink?

158
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,540
Battle.

159
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,300
The loser has to follow the winner’s order.

160
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,310
You’re serious.

161
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,260
Let’s see what you’ve got.

162
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,180
Ready?

163
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,860
Three, two, one.

164
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,500
I win.

165
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,180
I’m lame.

166
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,420
I can’t believe I battle with a bar owner.

167
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,100
Excuse me?

168
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,060
Thank you.

169
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,140
Firework.

170
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,900
Firework.

171
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,060
Firework.

172
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,660
It’s beautiful.

173
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,140
But it won’t last.

174
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,040
Not quite suitable for today.

175
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,020
I think it’s very suitable.

176
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,240
Fireworks die out.

177
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,580
Don’t fool with me.

178
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,380
I won just now.

179
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,620
You have to follow my order.

180
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,940
Mi Ya,

181
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,540
thank you for your company.

182
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,940
But,

183
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,800
I have had enough with the love games.

184
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
What did you say?

185
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,260
I’m serious.

186
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,420
You ask me out

187
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,580
to tell me this?

188
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,300
Yes.

189
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,820
Why?

190
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,300
Because I’m tired of you.

191
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,940
You’re lying.

192
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,020
You don’t dare to look in my eyes.

193
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,230
You’re avoiding me.

194
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,820
I’m tired of you.

195
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,500
I am tired of you.

196
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,980
Yi Nanke.

197
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,470
I know there are too many things recently.

198
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
We’ve gone through so much.

199
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,980
Watch out for your tone, OK?

200
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,220
I’ve thought it through.

201
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,140
From now on,

202
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,300
I won’t make contact with you.

203
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,580
Neither should you.

204
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,140
Yi Nanke,

205
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,380
as I’ve told you just now,

206
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,710
watch out for your tone.

207
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,940
I won’t forgive you for all of

208
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,640
your inappropriate remarks.

209
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,940
I told you, too, just now.

210
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,140
I’ve thought it through.

211
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,180
Every word I said, I mean it.

212
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,580
It’s over.

213
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,580
We are done.

214
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,660
I think I just can’t

215
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,940
live happily

216
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,340
like you expect.

217
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,910
There are things I can’t and don’t want to forget.

218
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,540
Things I can’t avoid.

219
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,420
I have to do.

220
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,820
I can’t keep Mi Ya around me.

221
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,590
It’s too dangerous.

222
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,300
I got someone in my heart

223
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,300
The room is empty

224
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,300
I call out in the loneliness

225
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,620
Birthday cake candles expose tears in my eyes

226
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,340
Got my birthday wrong but not with my habits

227
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,060
I die inside, yet you’re still haunting

228
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,790
- Thank you.  - Thank you.

229
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,020
Hello, sir.

230
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,020
We’re having a promotion today.

231
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,020
Hope you can be our guests.

232
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,220
We’ll give you Nick’s ears.

233
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,020
Bunny ears and fox ears.

234
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,540
Thank you.

235
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,359
They’re gifts.

236
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,500
- Thank you.  - Thank you.

237
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,380
Adorable.

238
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,329
Here.

239
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,880
Put this one on my head.

240
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,190
How do I look?

241
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,180
Is it cute?

242
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,300
Very cute.

243
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,100
This is Officer Judy and Nick the Fox.

244
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,980
They’re a model couple.

245
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,660
Here. Wear this one.

246
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,660
I’d rather not.

247
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,740
You said you’d listen to me

248
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,180
when we go out shopping.

249
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,060
I said I’d go out with you.

250
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,180
But this is lame.

251
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,080
I don’t want it.

252
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,820
As you wish.

253
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,020
Who cares?

254
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,060
Thank you.

255
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,340
Excuse me?

256
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,660
Can I have some instant hot pot?

257
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,220
OK.

258
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,620
No. Not food from vendors.

259
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,380
I want some. I haven’t eaten it for long.

260
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,780
No.

261
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
Not even without pepper and chili?

262
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
It causes damage to your palate.

263
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,560
All right. No more hot pot. Let’s go home.

264
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,260
Let’s go.

265
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,300
OK.

266
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,340
Shouldn’t you be asleep?

267
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,400
What are you doing?

268
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,980
Don’t you see it?

269
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,460
I’m making hot pot.

270
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,620
Where did you get this?

271
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,460
The ingredients were always there.

272
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,750
You just didn’t know they were.

273
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,040
I wanted to order some take-outs.

274
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,860
I felt guilty to you.

275
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,070
But I’d be sorry for myself if I didn’t.

276
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,740
No.

277
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,900
Hot pot is not allowed.

278
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,900
You come right on time.

279
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,460
Look, we get the soup boiling.

280
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,660
Come on. Have a taste.

281
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,820
Smells good.

282
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,860
Did you follow the smell here?

283
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,600
Never mind.

284
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,080
One exception.

285
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,830
But this is the only one.

286
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,540
You hear me?

287
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,460
Make an exception for yourself and have a bite.

288
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,300
This is my favorite bean cream roll.

289
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,940
Tasty and smooth.

290
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,260
With some sesame sauce.

291
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,620
It tastes good.

292
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,980
I told you.

293
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,340
None of those who have tried hot pot

294
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,940
doesn’t fall in love with it.

295
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,940
Get some beef for me.

296
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,500
OK.

297
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,060
Just put the beef

298
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,280
in the boiling soup for a short while.

299
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,990
Or it makes the beef taste terrible

300
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,750
The ingredients are spicy though.

301
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,780
I promise

302
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,300
I made it less spicy.

303
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,040
It won’t harm your palate.

304
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,540
I’m back!

305
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,740
Zui,

306
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,060
are you following the delicious smell?

307
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,780
I never knew

308
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,740
you have talent in cooking.

309
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,220
Though

310
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,670
I’m inferior to Lu Weixun in many aspects,

311
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,900
don’t forget

312
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,620
that I’m a  blue chip,

313
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,230
with huge potential to appreciation.

314
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,580
No need to worry for your marriage anymore.

315
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,660
Wait for Mr. He.

316
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,560
Where is my dad?

317
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,800
He goes out to play chess with Mr. Cui.

318
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,340
He usually comes back at this moment.

319
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,060
How are you doing recently?

320
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,620
You can count on me

321
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,070
for the thing you asked.

322
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,500
Under my thorough care,

323
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,580
your dad has gained 1.5 kg

324
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,380
since you left.

325
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,080
You’re more reliable.

326
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,220
Oh, do you know?

327
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,100
Mr. He and Mr. Wan

328
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,560
used to be colleagues.

329
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,740
Mr. Wan is good at concealing his thoughts.

330
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,500
A genius laid concealed.

331
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,800
Feelings and thoughts

332
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,220
buried deep.

333
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,260
Mr. Wan came?

334
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,820
For once.

335
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,520
They didn’t talk much.

336
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,540
They didn’t talk much?

337
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,180
Hello, Mr. Wan.

338
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,100
Buzui, you want to talk?

339
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,300
Nothing urgent.

340
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,180
I just learned

341
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,340
that you helped my dad sell the Distillery

342
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,780
to pay for my medical treatment.

343
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,100
Were you the buyer?

344
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,900
I didn’t have money to buy the Distillery.

345
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,420
I made a fortune after that.

346
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,300
Due to my affection to the Distillery,

347
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,620
I bought it as a warehouse.

348
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,940
Do you know who the buyer was?

349
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
You don’t know?

350
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,180
I thought you knew.

351
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,340
It’s Mr. Lu.

352
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,940
OK. OK.

353
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,700
What’s up?

354
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,860
I’m OK. Let’s eat.

355
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,580
Mr. Lu.

356
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,660
Lu Weixun.

357
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,100
Mr. Lu,

358
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,800
here are the invitations.

359
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,580
Idol, what brings you here?

360
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,820
We’re invited, too.

361
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,620
As far as I can tell,

362
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
it can’t be anything good

363
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,640
he gathers us here.

364
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,500
What can be wrong?

365
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,260
He just wants to show off.

366
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,900
You can never be sure.

367
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,020
He enjoys plotting

368
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,860
in mystery.

369
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,100
Idol, you look handsome tonight.

370
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,000
Sure you catch all the attention.

371
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,460
What about me?

372
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,180
You?

373
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
No matter what you do,

374
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,940
you’d never steal the spotlight from my idol.

375
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,870
Forget about it.

376
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,620
Welcome!

377
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,540
All the guests here are my friends.

378
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,700
I just want to gather you around.

379
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,030
Have some wine and chat.

380
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,540
Enjoy the night.

381
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,060
Mu Chunfeng, I warn you.

382
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,060
Though I don’t know

383
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,540
what you are after now,

384
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,180
you’d better save your wicked ideas

385
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,380
against my idol.

386
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,460
Xia Fan, come on.

387
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,460
Let’s get in.

388
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,620
Hold on. I’m expecting one more friend.

389
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,220
Mr. Yi.

390
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,660
Idol,

391
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,060
what happened between Yi Nanke and Mi Ya?

392
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,140
Don’t know.

393
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,940
You’d better know yourself well first.

394
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,870
Friends, please be seated.

395
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,960
Excuse me for a moment.

396
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,380
What are you doing?

397
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,020
Take a photo.

398
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,620
No.

399
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,230
- Please enjoy.  -Thank you.

400
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,820
Apple, jasmine,

401
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,110
the fragrance of tropical fruits,

402
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,580
and my favorite flavor of oak.

403
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,740
You would never get tired of the taste

404
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,000
of Buck Winery’s Chardonnay White Wine.

405
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,110
- I said no.  - Stay still.

406
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,780
Buzui.

407
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,980
Idol, one more.

408
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,980
Give me a pose.

409
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,180
What’s going on with you and Mi Ya?

410
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,460
Nothing.

411
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,480
I can tell something is wrong.

412
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,920
What does it have anything to do with you?

413
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,500
You…

414
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,560
What’s wrong with you two?

415
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,520
What are you referring to?

416
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,940
You’re so indifferent to him.

417
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,660
I’m indifferent to everyone.

418
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,860
But I think you two…

419
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,660
Broke up.

420
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,460
You don’t really mean it, right?

421
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,260
Your hearts are still with each other.

422
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,420
It takes time for

423
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,420
aged wine to oxidate.

424
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,660
Let alone our affection.

425
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,700
It takes time to grow.

426
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,150
Can I ask you something?

427
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,660
Do you remember Mr. Yang?

428
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,100
How could I forget?

429
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,760
What about him?

430
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,020
I looked into his background

431
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,620
and found where he lived.

432
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,100
Any findings?

433
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,060
His family disappeared.

434
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,620
All of them.

435
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,880
I’ve asked the neighbors.

436
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,950
His family disappeared

437
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,990
the next day he committed suicide.

438
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,340
I believe there must be something wrong

439
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,470
with my dad’s death.

440
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,980
You’re making it terribly scary.

441
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,310
He Buzui,

442
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,420
think carefully.

443
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,920
Is there any other clue in your dream?

444
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,620
I’ve seen your winery

445
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,020
and tasted your wine.

446
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,070
I’m leaving.

447
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,820
Mi Ya is leaving.

448
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,910
You’re not going to say good night?

449
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,100
What happened to you?

450
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,140
Everyone has his secret.

451
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
What secret?

452
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,140
He just doesn’t care how Mi Ya feels.

453
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,180
What do you know?

454
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
No one cares about her more than I do.

455
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,460
It’s just, right now,

456
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,740
I have to uncover the truth concerning my dad’s death.

457
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,300
It involves so many things.

458
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,270
I’m afraid she’ll get hurt.

459
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,870
Then you should make it clear with her.

460
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,540
Look how upset she is.

461
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,710
It’s their personal business.

462
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,910
You’d better stay out of it.

463
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,340
If you don’t want to face her,

464
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,140
why did you come?

465
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,340
I come to see Wan Ran.

466
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,780
Mr. Wan?

467
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,780
He’s related to everything.

468
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,040
Don’t you find it strange?

469
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
But he’s not the only one

470
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,760
who knows about Pear Blossom.

471
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,020
Did you have fun?

472
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,860
The dessert is tasty. And the wine is superb.

473
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,020
It’s a great honor to make you happy.

474
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,100
Mr. Mu Chunfeng,

475
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,740
please spend more of your energy

476
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,620
on the operation of Buck Winery,

477
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,180
instead of thinking about

478
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,620
how to make a girl happy.

479
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,440
Thanks for the notice.

480
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,790
I will keep Buck Winery in good operation.

481
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,540
Maybe my idol would win the next competition,

482
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,870
and get the winery back.

483
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,820
Mr. Lu,

484
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,500
I need your information on something.

485
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,140
What is it?

486
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,580
When I was checking the Buck Winery’s storage,

487
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,140
I found lots of liquor stored in the winery.

488
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,660
Liquor?

489
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,820
Why is there liquor?

490
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,500
I have no idea.

491
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,340
I also checked the accounts.

492
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,580
No relevant transactions are found.

493
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,180
Master is travelling abroad now.

494
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,300
So I want to ask

495
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,580
if you know where the liquor comes from.

496
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,500
Can we have a look

497
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,380
in Buck Winery’s cellar?

498
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,860
Of course.

499
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,260
What is he suspecting?

500
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,680
Hope you have nothing to do with this.

501
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,940
Can I open a case?

502
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,700
Please.

503
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,860
It’s Pear Blossom.

504
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,380
Lu Weixun,

505
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,340
You’d better explain it.

506
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,460
Why are there Pear Blossom in the cellar

507
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,659
of Buck Winery of your family business?

508
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,670
I don’t know why.

509
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,580
Don’t know?

510
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,260
It better be true.

511
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,210
What are you talking about?

512
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,690
What?

513
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,139
Mr. Yang, the adulterator,

514
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,380
committed suicide before the police came to him,

515
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,140
you know?

516
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,540
It must be a misunderstanding.

517
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,670
Misunderstanding?

518
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,980
He killed himself before the police could get him.

519
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,620
And his family disappeared.

520
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,510
If he just adulterated liquor,

521
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,700
it wouldn’t have cost his life.

522
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,900
His family wouldn’t have disappeared.

523
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,140
What are you implying?

524
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,740
Mr. Yang is a scapegoat.

525
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,980
It’s not counterfeit that killed him.

526
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,860
It’s the secret behind it.

527
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,150
Who has so much power to do that?

528
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
I think there’s no need for me to say.

529
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,620
Lu Weixun.

530
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,100
You’ve been with us

531
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,020
all through the case about Pear Blossom.

532
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,620
It would be easy for you

533
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,550
to keep somebody informed, right?

534
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,110
Are you saying that my idol is a bad man?

535
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,220
Do you have evidence?

536
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,080
You’re making unproven charges.

537
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,420
Evidence?

538
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,180
You know what is

539
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,380
the biggest advantage of running a bar?

540
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,080
You see lots of people.

541
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,630
I have a guest who is gifted with the Internet.

542
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,740
He helped me look into the financial status

543
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,070
of the Joy Winery for the past two decades.

544
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,900
Many of their businesses

545
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,500
were related to the Lu Group.

546
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,500
Do you know who the buyer was?

547
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,940
You don’t know?

548
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,620
I thought you knew.

549
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,660
It’s Mr. Lu.

550
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,940
You know He Wine Distillery?

551
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,540
Your mom liked the Pear Blossom

552
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,940
from their distillery very much.

553
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,740
I know mom would like its flavor.

554
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,380
Right.

555
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,900
Do we still have some in Buck Winery?

556
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,140
Yes.

557
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,620
Go get it if you want a sip.

558
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,540
Lu Weixun,

559
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
your dad killed my dad, you know?

560
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,990
You jump to the conclusion.

561
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,540
Do I?

562
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,540
What are you going to say about the Pear Blossom?

563
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,980
Pear Blossom?

564
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,980
He Buzui, say something.

565
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,180
It was your father

566
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,030
who bought the He Wine Distillery.

567
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,220
Do you know about it?

568
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,940
Why did you tell me you didn’t?

569
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,860
Before we find out what happened that year,

570
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,300
I don’t want any misunderstanding

571
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,860
to get in between us.

572
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,560
Why are you so sure it’s a misunderstanding?

573
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,660
Why didn’t you explain it to me?

574
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,340
Because things happened

575
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,870
all point to the direction I’m worried about.

576
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,820
He Buzui, don’t do that.

577
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,980
It’s bad for you to drink like that.
