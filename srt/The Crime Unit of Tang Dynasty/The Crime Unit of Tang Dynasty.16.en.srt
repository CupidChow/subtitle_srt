1
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,625
Hey, Old Master.

2
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,750
Was it you who blew the horn just now?

3
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,291
Then why did those two react to the horn?

4
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,750
Kind words can't save a darned soul.

5
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,250
You were lucky to survive this time.

6
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,750
Didn't we risk ourselves to save you?

7
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,916
Troublemaker, give it back!

8
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,458
You tricked us into looking for your grandfather, didn't you?

9
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,333
Speak.

10
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,583
Let go.

11
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,625
Grandpa.

12
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,666
Dogwa, go to bed.

13
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,833
Go.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,875
Old Master.

15
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,208
Why did those two villagers turn into monsters?

16
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,083
What do you know about this?

17
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,333
We can't leave until we find who we're looking for.

18
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,750
We're not leaving.

19
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,250
They've all caught an affliction.

20
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,625
When it strikes, they become like beasts.

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,416
Dogwa, this child...

22
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,541
He grew up among sheep.

23
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,958
Instead of feeding them sheep,

24
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:42,125
it might be better to feed them with you.

25
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,708
The disease turns them into monsters.

26
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,416
When will they change?

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,125
How many change at once?

28
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,583
It's never certain.

29
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,208
What exactly is this disease?

30
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,375
What have they been through?

31
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,916
You ask too many questions.

32
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,541
This is not the place for answers.

33
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,333
Thinking too much won't keep you alive.

34
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:14,916
Old Master.

35
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,083
Take this.

36
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,916
Remember, human life matters more than a sheep's.

37
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,250
Understand?

38
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,083
Hey, look.

39
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,750
There shouldn't be anything this valuable here.

40
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,625
Where did this come from?

41
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,625
I found it, I swear.

42
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,625
Let me see.

43
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,708
Where did you find it?

44
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,583
At...

45
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,416
At...

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,166
Still awake.

47
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,083
Your affliction is getting harder to control.

48
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,791
Your sheep reek.

49
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,583
Grass-fed beasts.

50
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,958
Not enough blood scent.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,416
Remember, you're human.

52
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,541
Not a beast.

53
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,166
Where's Guo Huai?

54
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,625
If he were here...

55
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,875
Would you dare talk like that?

56
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,750
You...

57
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,375
You've grown old.

58
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,250
Those chains you used to bind us,

59
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,208
have aged with you.

60
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,333
Shut your mouth!

61
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,791
Guo Huai isn't here.

62
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,291
Are you trying to cause trouble?

63
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,750
Hell’s gate is shut,

64
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,625
yet they force their way in.

65
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,291
It's fate.

66
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,125
Those people yesterday seemed like government lackeys.

67
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,458
You dare act recklessly?

68
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,916
I wouldn't dare.

69
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,041
If Brother Guo Huai finds out,

70
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,166
he'll kill me on the spot.

71
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,708
You'd better behave.

72
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,833
The princess is likely nearby.

73
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,250
We have to keep searching.

74
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,875
But out there, you can't tell people from monsters.

75
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,291
A princess of the realm vanished on the road.

76
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,416
I've received strict orders from above.

77
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,541
We must find the princess.

78
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,291
If anything happens to her,

79
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,791
if she's already dead...

80
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,000
We need her alive or her body.

81
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,666
Imperial orders.

82
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,125
Let's go.

83
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,291
You still dare go out?

84
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,625
Gouwa.

85
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,875
We're running out of mutton.

86
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,375
Excuse me, may I ask...

87
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,375
Have you seen its owner?

88
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,583
It's a woman.

89
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,625
A woman?

90
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,833
Women here

91
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,791
are scornfully called "two-legged lambs."

92
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,083
There's a cave east of the village.

93
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,625
You've seen her?

94
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

95
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,083
Thanks.

96
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,625
What's wrong?

97
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,583
Let's go.

98
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,666
Kid, why are you here?

99
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,041
The lamb is gone.

100
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,416
Do you know where this is?

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,250
Speak honestly.

102
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,083
Ghost.

103
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,833
Ghosts live here.

104
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,375
Ghost.

105
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,000
Are the ghosts villagers who changed?

106
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,666
Or were there ghosts here all along?

107
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,833
Frontier garrison's setup.

108
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,583
Looks like it's a military saber.

109
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:26,958
Princess.

110
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,916
Something's off.

111
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,791
What are you trying to do?

112
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,208
You beast!

113
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,083
Battlefield ghosts never claim lives.

114
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,166
That saying might not hold true today.
