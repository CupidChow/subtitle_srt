1
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,291
Sir, I truly apologize.

2
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,458
My mistake, my mistake.

3
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,208
Enough of that, just make your choice.

4
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,583
So this time, could you possibly...

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,041
Lin Xiaoran.

6
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,250
You're actually here?

7
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,916
Official Li, I...

8
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,291
We were just out for a walk and ended up here.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,250
Oh, Official Li.

10
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,958
These two honored guests have powerful connections.

11
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,625
It's rare for them to visit today.

12
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,041
There's a murder case at hand.

13
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,791
And you still want to keep the business running?

14
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,416
Oh, Official Li.

15
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,083
Please, have mercy on me.

16
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:39,166
I can't afford to offend any of these guests.

17
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,208
I'm sure you're aware of that.

18
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,000
Madam.

19
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,500
You've misunderstood Official Li's intentions.

20
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,875
Official Li means, since we're already here,

21
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,833
would you really let him spend the night alone?

22
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:51,875
Of course not.

23
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,875
Official Li, which courtesan do you fancy?

24
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,958
I'll send her to your room right away.

25
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,958
Oh, Madam.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What he means is, his tastes are a bit unusual.

27
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,541
He doesn't like young ladies.

28
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,375
He prefers older women.

29
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,041
Lin Xiaoran, what nonsense are you talking?

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,000
So, what age does Official Li prefer?

31
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,208
The older, the better.

32
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,916
Oh, you must be joking.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,875
Liuxiang Pavilion doesn't have women like that.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,458
Then Madam herself would be perfect.

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,875
Oh, stop making fun of me.

36
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:21,875
Lin Xiaoran.

37
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:22,541
Yes?

38
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,541
Within ten feet.

39
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,416
Within ten feet.

40
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,041
Sir, isn't it obvious?

41
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,500
I heard this place used to be a deserted graveyard.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,041
Wanning was clearly possessed by a ghost long ago.

43
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,208
Wanning was one of your courtesans too.

44
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,708
Why are you so sure?

45
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,250
Just look at her.

46
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,166
She gets prettier every day.

47
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,291
She charms the very souls out of the guests.

48
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,750
If that's not a ghost, what is it?

49
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,375
Sir.

50
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,125
That Chunxiang just now isn't a good sort.

51
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,083
She's always jealous of Wanning.

52
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,041
She wishes something would happen to Wanning's clients so she'd lose favor.

53
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,666
What about you? Aren't you jealous?

54
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,875
Me?

55
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,416
Here in Liuxiang Pavilion,

56
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,583
I'm the least attractive of all.

57
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,125
I'm just here to make a living.

58
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,041
Sir.

59
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,666
You don't suspect I had anything to do with Wanning's death, do you?

60
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,458
I'm just a weak woman.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,541
Please don't accuse an innocent person.

62
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,916
Did Wanning act strangely at all?

63
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,250
We all just serve our own clients.

64
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,750
Who has time to care about others?

65
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,000
Sir, my rates are quite fair.

66
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,416
So, how did you two living Zhuge Liangs do?

67
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,000
Did you find anything out?

68
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,333
The deceased just now was Official Zhang from the Luoyang Protectorate.

69
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,083
He committed suicide out of guilt two years ago.

70
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,750
The court let his case fizzle out.

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,125
Most people who come here wear masks.

72
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,416
It's very likely

73
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,125
they're all people who can't show their faces in daylight.

74
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,083
Xun Wan's death

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,375
is probably connected to this place too.

76
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,333
Hey, Xiaoran.

77
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah?

78
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,458
You've been gone for so long.

79
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,250
Did you find anything?

80
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,458
They all claim not to know Xun Wan.

81
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:23,875
I think

82
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,958
we need to try other methods.

83
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,791
Where are you going?

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,708
I'm off to spend a night with someone.

85
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,250
That brothel madam still has her charm.

86
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,916
I'm leaving now.

87
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,291
Official Li, aren't you coming with me?

88
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,333
I don't like older women.

89
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,708
A woman who can wield a sword and roam the world—

90
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,916
Lady Shen truly makes me envious.

91
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,708
How you want to live

92
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,041
is your own choice.

93
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,333
It has nothing to do with being male or female.

94
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,541
Miss Shen put it well.

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,291
I hope that one day

96
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,708
we can roam the world like Miss Shen.

97
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,791
Wanning is dead.

98
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,583
You two seem to get along better now.

99
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,166
She deserved to die anyway.

100
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,750
If not for her,

101
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,791
we wouldn't be scolded for not being as pretty.

102
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,625
Madam wouldn't beat and scold us every day.

103
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,208
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

104
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,625
The Liuxiang Pavilion contest will now continue.

105
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,333
Great, wonderful!

106
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,166
Good, good.

107
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,625
Good.

108
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,500
This...

109
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,166
This...

110
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,625
What is this?

111
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,416
Oh no, this won't do.

112
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,208
Would you choose this one?

113
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,375
No interest, it's embarrassing.

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,333
Not interested, right?

115
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,500
Such a letdown.

116
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,625
Couldn't you find someone prettier?

117
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,541
Is this even presentable? Are there no ladies left?

118
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,541
I don't want it, you take it.

119
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,875
I don't want it either.

120
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,166
Whoever wants it can keep it.

121
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:51,916
No, no.

122
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,208
Change it, please.

123
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,666
Hey, Official Li.

124
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,375
Official Li.

125
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:01,791
What is it?

126
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,625
Listen, this lady likes me.

127
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,208
I don't have enough money, lend me some.

128
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,000
This...

129
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,291
This isn't enough money.

130
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,833
What do you take our Madam for?

131
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,833
Be generous, be generous!

132
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,750
Don't go overboard.

133
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,541
Be generous.

134
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,166
Is this enough?

135
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,500
Isn't this too much?

136
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,666
It's just right.

137
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,208
So expensive!

138
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,250
Honored guest, please.

139
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,958
Wait for my news.

140
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,041
Remember,

141
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,875
you must leave before the candle burns out.

142
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,083
Your money only covers this one candle.

143
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,041
Sir, you're really handsome.

144
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,875
Will you help me undress?

145
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,666
Sure.

146
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:41,666
Aren't you afraid there's a female ghost under my mask?

147
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,166
Why not enjoy a night with a ghost?

148
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,333
Sir, don't let the candle go out.

149
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,833
Rules are meant to be broken.

150
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,458
Quick, undress, undress!

151
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,750
You're so naughty.

152
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,625
You're annoying.

153
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,625
Alright, alright.

154
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,458
I'm done playing, untie me.

155
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, sir!

156
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,875
Now that you're here, I don't plan to let you go.

157
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,125
Miss, I'm really not here for fun today.

158
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,208
I have something to ask you.

159
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,416
Oh, it's fine.

160
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,958
We can talk while we play, it's no problem.

161
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,250
I'm sorry, isn't that enough?

162
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,000
How about this: there's a handsome, rich man outside.

163
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,750
I'll introduce him to you.

164
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,250
Alright, what do you want to ask?

165
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,375
Untie me first.

166
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,875
Has this man, Xun Wan, ever been here?

167
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,166
Oh, I think I've seen him.

168
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,125
But that's not his name.

169
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,458
Huh?

170
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,791
Official Li, someone else has died.

171
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,208
Let's go.

172
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,250
When did it happen?

173
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,375
Just now.

174
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,000
We just saw Wanning.

175
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,333
She killed Chunxiang and Qiulan.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,333
Are you sure it was Wanning?

177
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,791
Chunxiang, Qiulan.

178
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,916
They just told me,

179
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,833
that after Wanning died, they'd finally have their chance.

180
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,833
Don't spread the word about this yet.

181
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,000
Who is it?

182
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,625
It's me. Do you think I'm a ghost?

183
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,291
Were you really possessed?

184
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,916
Yes.

185
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,708
What did she talk to you about?

186
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,791
Romance and lovers' bonds.

187
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,083
Do you want to hear?

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,958
Official.

189
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,041
Official, help us!

190
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,166
Two more courtesans have died.

191
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,000
What should we do?

192
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,875
Please save us, Official.

193
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,083
The female ghost here—

194
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,541
She won't let us go.

195
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,166
There are no ghosts in this world.

196
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,333
And ghosts don't kill people.

197
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,750
But the courtesans all saw it.

198
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,833
Did someone named Xun Wan come here?

199
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,208
I'm not sure about that.

200
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,916
Guests here all use fake names.

201
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,625
Announce to the guests—

202
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,125
the contest will proceed as usual.

203
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,125
But—

204
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,416
We're all waiting for the ghost to show up again.

205
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,708
Relax.

206
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,291
Since those officials gave the order,

207
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,541
the bidding can't be stopped.

208
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,208
I'm counting on you now.

209
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,166
Now that Wanning is dead,

210
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,916
those high-ranking officials

211
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,750
will surely pay you endless silver.

212
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,958
You should thank me properly.

213
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,000
Enough.

214
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,708
Ghost! Ghost!

215
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,500
Official Li! Ghost! Ghost!

216
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,375
Yunjin, you wretched slave!

217
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,416
Coming.

218
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,291
Will you take it off yourself, or should I do it?

219
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,750
Wanning.

220
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,541
Why is it you?
