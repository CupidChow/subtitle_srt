1
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,291
Unlucky wretch.

2
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,250
The master said not to burn joss paper for Madam.

3
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,333
Do you have a death wish?

4
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,375
No, Steward Liu.

5
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,375
Madam was always kind to me when she was alive.

6
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Stop talking and keep watch.

7
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,875
Let me gamble one more time.

8
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:48,625
I'm begging you.

9
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,750
I can win it back for sure.

10
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,708
I will win it back.

11
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,875
Please, I'm begging you.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,125
Let me gamble one more time.

13
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,333
Just one more bet, please.

14
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,750
I swear I can win it back.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,625
Good luck, sir.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,916
Where is my wife?

17
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,166
Go back and you'll see your wife.

18
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,375
Lin Xiaoran

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,333
As soon as I arrived in Chang'an County,

20
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,250
I heard that Madam Shen came back to life on the seventh night after her death.

21
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,416
What do you think about this?

22
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,166
There’s nothing too strange in this world.

23
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,666
This trick of reviving the dead

24
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,000
I’d like to see it for myself.

25
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,458
Nephew, what brings you here today?

26
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,916
About the Sand Ghost Case I investigated earlier,

27
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,416
I’d like to ask for your help with the procedures, Uncle.

28
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,250
No need to mention it.

29
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,875
It’s all part of my duty.

30
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,916
I passed by Xianyun Zhai,

31
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,500
and brought some snow pear soup for Aunt.

32
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,666
I wonder if Aunt will like it.

33
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,708
You’re very thoughtful.

34
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,708
But unfortunately,

35
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,083
the household is busy today.

36
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,125
We won’t keep you both.

37
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,666
Snow pear soup is my favorite.

38
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,125
Since you’re both here,

39
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,666
why not stay for a meal?

40
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:07,750
Sure.

41
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,375
Aunt suffered from a cough for years.

42
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,041
But now she’s perfectly fine.

43
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,833
Could you share some advice?

44
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,750
I’d like to help ease my adoptive father’s illness too.

45
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,958
It was just a folk remedy from a wandering healer.

46
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,000
I’ve also learned many folk remedies in the Jianghu.

47
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,750
Including the bone-feeling diagnosis technique.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,166
Let me examine Madam.

49
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,458
There’s no sign of disguise on her face.

50
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,416
Her pulse is perfectly normal.

51
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,416
That’s enough.

52
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,458
You’ve seen what you needed.

53
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,583
We won’t keep you. See them out.

54
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,083
Uncle.

55
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,375
Well?

56
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,916
No sign of alteration on her face.

57
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,500
Doesn’t look like someone pretending.

58
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,875
Boss, I found a clue.

59
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,666
Sir,

60
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,583
I’m telling the truth.

61
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,000
I really saw Madam come back to life.

62
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,708
I wouldn’t dare lie.

63
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,541
They’re coming, they’re coming!

64
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,291
Master.

65
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,125
Madam.

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,333
My husband has returned.

67
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,875
Madam looks and acts exactly as before.

68
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,625
She doesn’t look sick at all.

69
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,958
She truly came back from the dead.

70
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,416
Do you believe his nonsense?

71
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,458
I can’t explain supernatural things.

72
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,083
But even if he’s telling the truth,

73
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,041
bringing the dead back to life is nearly impossible.

74
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,333
I just saw a totem on Shen Wanyan’s hand.

75
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,541
I’ve never seen it before.

76
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,291
You’ve seen enough, we won’t keep you.

77
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,416
See them out.

78
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,708
Is this what the totem looks like?

79
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,750
Yes, that’s the one.

80
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,250
Where did this token come from?

81
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,791
It looked interesting, so I took it from Shen Wanyan’s study.

82
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, right.

83
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,041
Why are you here?

84
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,333
She’s always elusive.

85
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,125
You’re still not used to it.

86
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,416
I heard there’s a resurrection show at the Shen residence.

87
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,041
Of course I had to come and see.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,791
This matter might be very complicated.

89
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,083
Gather all the brothers.

90
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,166
Secretly investigate every gambling house and tavern.

91
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,458
See if anyone recognizes this token.

92
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,125
Be careful not to alert the enemy.

93
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:06,958
Yes.

94
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,000
Shut your mouth.

95
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:12,833
Stop shouting.

96
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,416
This kid is really improving.

97
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,875
Shut up, I get it.

98
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,125
You should see who he’s following.

99
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,875
Are you looking for me?
