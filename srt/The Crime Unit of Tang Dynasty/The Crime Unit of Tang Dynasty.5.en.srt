1
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,541
So Magistrate Sun hid all the bodies here.

2
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,750
He built a wall out of corpses.

3
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,958
To cure Madam Sun's illness,

4
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,791
Magistrate Sun

5
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,125
Is this how he atones for his sins?

6
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,666
What about the monk?

7
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,041
Living Buddha

8
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,291
In this life,

9
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,833
are we destined to suffer endlessly?

10
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,708
It's hard to find a perfect solution in this world.

11
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,708
What are you doing? What are you doing?

12
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,041
What are you all doing?

13
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,125
Monk

14
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,833
In this world,

15
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,958
is there truly no way to have it both ways?

16
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,083
Monk

17
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,458
Do you like me?

18
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,958
Monk

19
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,250
Do you like me?

20
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,166
I do.

21
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,083
People never witness Snow in July

22
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:56,500
Joy lingers by ruined walls and a dying hearth

23
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:27,958
Lin Xiaoran

24
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,708
What I owed you

25
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,333
I had someone make a new one

26
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,958
Some people can clearly speak

27
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,791
but always choose to stay silent

28
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,041
Some should see the wonders of the world

29
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,625
but would rather lose their sight

30
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,291
This is not a case of humans

31
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,958
but a case of ghosts

32
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,791
Lin Xiaoran

33
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,625
I lost

34
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,041
But there's something I still don't understand

35
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,833
The night Liu Gui secretly brought Liu Qiaoqiao's body home

36
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,666
The monk never went to the Liu residence

37
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,958
So who pretended to be Liu Qiaoqiao's ghost

38
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,708
and scared Madam Liu to death?

39
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,000
Qiaoqiao, it's all Liu Gui's fault

40
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,208
I don't know anything

41
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,750
Just treat me as deaf and blind

42
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,958
Your matters have nothing to do with me

43
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,291
You said it's a ghost case

44
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,875
Do you expect me to ask Madam Liu's ghost?

45
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,791
Between black and white

46
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,750
It's hard to tell humans from ghosts

47
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,875
What a prosperous world this is

48
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,833
Willows alive, spin the top

49
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,916
Willows green, fly the kite

50
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:37,541
Willows dead, kick the shuttlecock

51
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,083
Willows alive, spin the top

52
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,375
Willows green, fly the kite

53
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,791
Willows dead, kick the shuttlecock

54
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,958
Sister, why do you sing so beautifully?

55
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,791
Because I've known how since I was little

56
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,041
My sister Liu Yanran taught me

57
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,666
Lin Xiaoran

58
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,333
According to my investigation

59
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,000
This book is divided into "The Art of Manipulating People" and "The Art of Ruling a Country"

60
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,583
And "The Art of Ruling a Country"

61
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,708
was secretly presented by Magistrate Sun to a powerful figure in the capital

62
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,500
That's why he was allowed to act arrogantly in Fuan County

63
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,916
If that's the case, this is a big deal

64
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,125
Who would dare be interested in ruling the country?

65
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,708
Don't worry, I'll get to the bottom of this

66
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,166
Lin Xiaoran

67
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,541
I’ll give you two choices now

68
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,625
One, stay and help me investigate

69
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,916
I choose the second

70
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,291
Two, be my assistant

71
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,291
You must not leave my side

72
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,208
How about it?

73
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,083
Actually, Li Jingnian

74
00:09:59,125 --> 00:09:59,708
Hmm

75
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,375
I came here to say goodbye

76
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,583
I never agreed to let you leave

77
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,458
Oh, what about her?

78
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,750
Lin Xiaoran, how many times has this happened?

79
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,791
You owe me again

80
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,125
What’s one more debt?

81
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,000
Alright, you can pay me back slowly

82
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,666
This haunted place isn’t safe to stay long

83
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,000
No matter about this person

84
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,000
He’s an official from the court

85
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,583
Deal with him however you want

86
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,875
Out here in the wilderness

87
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,666
This kid looks pretty decent

88
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,291
Sure, he’s yours now
