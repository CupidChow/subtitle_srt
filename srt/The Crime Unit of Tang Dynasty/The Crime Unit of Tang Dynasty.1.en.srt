1
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,250
The mighty Tang dynasty,

2
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,833
was on the verge of collapse.

3
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,375
Dark forces and malignant spirits spread, and evil rituals flourished among the people.

4
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:06,500
Among these, one particular ritual was especially sinister.

5
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,625
It used the bodies of women as vessels.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,416
Women who fell victim to it

7
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,916
met with tragic and eerie fates.

8
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:28,166
This story begins when Liu Qiaoqiao witnessed her sister's death firsthand.

9
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,041
The deceased is Liu Qiaoqiao.

10
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,208
She was eighteen years old.

11
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,291
Time of death was around dusk.

12
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,583
No signs of struggle were found nearby.

13
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,125
It seems this is not the place where she died.

14
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,083
Boss.

15
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,250
This is the first witness who found the body.

16
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:33,833
Do you know her?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,750
This humble monk has met Miss Liu a few times.

18
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,250
Your subordinate arrived late.

19
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,625
Sun Shoujing of Fuan County greets the Imperial Envoy Li.

20
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,583
Qiaoqiao.

21
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,875
Qiaoqiao.

22
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,875
He is the victim's father, Liu Gui.

23
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,583
That's right.

24
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,916
Your subordinate is late.

25
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,625
I was just questioning him.

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,500
Besides Liu Qiaoqiao,

27
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,541
Liu Gui has another daughter named Liu Yanran.

28
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,666
She is also missing now.

29
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,041
This is a crime scene.

30
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,416
Have them step aside for now.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,541
Take them away for the time being.

32
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,458
Qiaoqiao.

33
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,541
Qiaoqiao.

34
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,791
My child, Qiaoqiao.

35
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,625
Rest assured, Imperial Envoy.

36
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,458
This case concerns the safety of Fuan County's people.

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,416
Your subordinate will do his utmost to investigate.

38
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,333
How many days?

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,791
Ah?

40
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,000
I mean, how many days will you need?

41
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,916
Three days.

42
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,250
A bride in red, dead and dread.

43
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,208
Her life cut short, her eyes gouged out.

44
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,250
On the Ghost Festival night.

45
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,500
Even Yama cannot withstand.

46
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,208
What does that mean?

47
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,500
This woman died too tragically.

48
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,708
Her vengeful spirit lingers.

49
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,625
Soon, her corpse will rise and harm others.

50
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,916
Bringing disaster to the region.

51
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,541
You charlatan.

52
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,500
It's been years since we last met.

53
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,000
Still spouting nonsense as always.

54
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,250
Lord Li.

55
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,916
You investigate the imperial case.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,916
I investigate supernatural cases among the people.

57
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,333
Wherever dark forces commit crimes,

58
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,208
you will find me, Lin Xiaoran.

59
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,083
Imperial Envoy.

60
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,000
How should Liu Qiaoqiao's body be handled now?

61
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,166
Temporarily place it in the mortuary.

62
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,375
Have the coroner examine it thoroughly.

63
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,000
Then you must inspect it carefully.

64
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,791
Tonight is the Ghost Festival night.

65
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,125
Yama is fierce.

66
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,583
Vengeful ghosts are relentless.

67
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,958
Spreading superstitious rumors.

68
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,458
Lock him up in the yamen.

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,958
Take him away.

70
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:17,500
Yes.

71
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,083
I...

72
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,666
I can solve the case in three days.

73
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,791
Several young girls have gone missing in your county in recent years.

74
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,833
Rumor has it they all fell victim to dark forces.

75
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,500
But now,

76
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,541
only Liu Qiaoqiao's body has been found.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,916
Magistrate Sun,

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,291
tell me,

79
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,958
has the killer changed their ways?

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,958
Stories of dark forces causing murders

81
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,916
have been circulating in the county for a long time.

82
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,458
Your subordinate is truly incompetent.

83
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,291
I cannot contend with these dark forces.

84
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,458
I am unworthy as a local official.

85
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,583
Ah...

86
00:04:59,458 --> 00:04:59,916
Madam...

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,083
What's wrong, madam?

88
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,583
Madam, it's alright. Don't be afraid. So noisy, so noisy...

89
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,750
Madam, it's okay now.

90
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,875
Forgive me, Imperial Envoy.

91
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,208
My wife has suffered from madness for a long time.

92
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,083
I hope you won't hold it against us, Imperial Envoy.

93
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,541
It's fine, it's fine.

94
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,833
So noisy, so noisy...

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,458
Let's go back.

96
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,125
It's alright now, it's alright.

97
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:21,791
Boss.

98
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:22,625
Sir.

99
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,916
After my examination,

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,625
the deceased, Liu Qiaoqiao,

101
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,666
shows no signs of resistance.

102
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,291
She appeared calm at the time of death.

103
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,708
It seems like suicide.

104
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,416
Suicide?

105
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,958
Sigh...

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Who would commit suicide

107
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,333
by gouging out their own eyes?

108
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,250
I am puzzled as well.

109
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,250
But the body doesn't lie.

110
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,416
The victim was indeed very compliant at the time of death.

111
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,750
Understood. You may go.

112
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,250
Could it be...

113
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,125
she was truly under some evil spell?

114
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,208
Oh, Imperial Envoy Li,

115
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,958
didn't you say you don't believe in my tales of spirits?

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,375
What do you mean now?

117
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,416
I asked you to join me at the mortuary to investigate

118
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,500
just to give you a chance to prove yourself.

119
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't worry.

120
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,916
If you find nothing,

121
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,333
you know what awaits you.

122
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,458
It's late and the road is dangerous.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,541
Wild ghosts roam about.

124
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,250
Sir Li,

125
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,458
look behind you.

126
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,666
Stop pretending to see ghosts.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,958
Come, drink.

128
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,166
Which way did you say the corpse's head was facing?

129
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,708
I remember it was facing south.

130
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,208
I thought it was facing north.

131
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,625
Ah, never mind. Come on.

132
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,458
Why are you poking me?

133
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,166
A ghost wouldn't poke you.

134
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,625
Ghost!

135
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,250
Ghost! Ghost!

136
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,458
Imperial Envoy

137
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,166
Tonight is the Ghost Festival

138
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,208
Be careful. Mystic, show yourself!

139
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,458
Qiaoqiao, let me take you home.

140
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,041
Lin Xiaoran.

141
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,291
Tell me,

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,875
should I just kill you right now?

143
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,416
Shouldn't Imperial Envoy Li compensate me with a bell first?

144
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,708
Wait, Imperial Envoy Li.

145
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,791
I just saw Liu Gui carrying a corpse outside.

146
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,291
I think solving the case is more urgent right now.

147
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,000
Liu Gui.

148
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:05,791
Ah.

149
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,458
Isn't he Liu Qiaoqiao's father?

150
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,625
Why did he take the corpse away?

151
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,250
You should ask him that.

152
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,666
About what happened earlier,

153
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,541
I'll settle it with you later.

154
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,541
Tomorrow,

155
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,166
come with me to the Liu residence.

156
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,208
Come on.

157
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,250
Please, let me go.

158
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,500
I've raised you all these years.

159
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,333
Isn't it time for you to repay me?

160
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,041
Even though you're not my biological child,

161
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,916
I still brought you up.

162
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,166
If you hold any resentment,

163
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,916
don't ever come looking for me.

164
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,250
This is the corpse-suppressing ritual given to me by the Master.

165
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,208
It subdues vengeful ghosts like you, who harbor malice.

166
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,166
Mother.

167
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,958
Mother.

168
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,166
Mother.

169
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,333
Mother, where are your eyes?
