00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,666
One day ago

2
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,625
I parted ways with Li Jingnian and the others

3
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,541
and came alone to Lonely Inscription Villa

4
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,125
Back then, I had no idea I would die here

5
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,833
Open the door! Let me out!

6
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:03,916
Let me out!

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,208
The killer is outside

8
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,416
Let me out!

9
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,750
Don’t you want to know who the murderer is?

10
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,708
If you kill me

11
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,333
you’ll all die too

12
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,458
Master, this is our grand gift for you

13
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,083
Good, very good

14
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,250
The victim’s body is thin

15
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,750
Multiple bone fractures

16
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,291
He must have suffered abuse before death

17
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,833
Two fatal stab wounds to the chest

18
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,416
The wounds are so subtle

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,958
which means the toxin is extremely potent

20
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,166
It seems the cause of death may not be the stab wounds

21
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,625
Who are you?

22
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,541
I am Lian Songbai, heir of the Lian Family

23
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,291
I’ve come with my wife to celebrate my mentor’s birthday

24
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,625
Did you kill him?

25
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,416
I didn’t

26
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,625
Only one of you can live

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,958
Whoever tells the truth will survive

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,791
If my husband dies

29
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,000
I won’t live alone either

30
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,666
I, Gao Li, am a renowned and upright scholar

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,083
I could never do such a thing

32
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,250
My adoptive father is a high official in the capital

33
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,541
I can give you anything you want

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,291
Just say if you killed him or not

35
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,000
I...

36
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you doing?

37
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,875
Young Hero Lin is also a guest

38
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,666
Master, he drugged us first and knocked us out

39
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,666
Then he interrogated us like criminals

40
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,291
Luckily, Butler Wang arrived

41
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,041
I was just investigating the case

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,333
I didn’t do anything to you

43
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,875
Besides, you tied me up too, so we’re even

44
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:00,666
It’s over

45
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,916
Alright, you all go back now

46
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,791
No one is allowed to mention today’s events

47
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,625
Young Hero Lin

48
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,291
Sorry you had to suffer

49
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,458
I have some reputation in the literary circles

50
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:26,666
It must be a prank by some old rival

51
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,083
Let’s just forget about it

52
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,750
Wang Zheng

53
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,500
Go bury the body quickly

54
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,041
Yes, Master

55
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,250
Let’s leave it at that

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,166
I know your death was unjust

57
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,500
But you’ve been gone for so many years

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,541
Just rest in peace

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,708
Teng Rong

60
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,291
Something's wrong.

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,916
They're definitely hiding something.

62
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,250
They have a connection to that unidentified corpse.

63
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,250
There's no way they're not involved.

64
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,041
Madam, it's time to get up.

65
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,083
A ghost! A ghost!

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,125
What's going on?

67
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,333
What's happening?

68
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,916
That's the pot calling the kettle black.

69
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,083
I think you killed Teng Rong.

70
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,916
There are only a few of us in Lonely Inscription Villa.

71
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,375
Except for you, the outsider.

72
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,208
Young Master Gao Li,

73
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,000
You might want to think again.

74
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,000
There's also an unidentified male corpse here.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,458
What if Teng Rong wasn't killed by a person?

76
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,250
What do you mean by that?

77
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,333
Young Hero Lin,

78
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,875
What are you implying?

79
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:53,833
Old Master,

80
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,708
Actually, I ran into Teng Rong last night.

81
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,208
He told me

82
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,625
there's a vengeful ghost that's haunted this villa for years.

83
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,125
The ghost told him

84
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,375
he won't spare anyone present.

85
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,166
No one.

86
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,875
From this moment on,

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,083
I've realized everyone is hiding something.

88
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,833
Teng Rong's death

89
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,958
is only the beginning.
