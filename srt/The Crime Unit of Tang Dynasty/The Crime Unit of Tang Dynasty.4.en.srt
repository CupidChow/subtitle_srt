1
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,416
This ruined temple has been torn down.

2
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,916
You still have the nerve to live?

3
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,583
Go meet your Buddha.

4
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,125
What are you doing? What are you doing?

5
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,583
What are you two doing?

6
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,041
Well, a lowly slave and a bald donkey.

7
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,333
You two even teamed up.

8
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,541
Keep beating them for me.

9
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,666
I'm exhausted—let's go.

10
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,250
Miss, are you alright?

11
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,000
Master Liu punished you again?

12
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,833
Monk.

13
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,375
In this world,

14
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,416
is there truly no way for everyone to win?

15
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,083
Who are you, really?

16
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,166
Where is Liu Yiran’s body?

17
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,791
Willows sprout, whip the top

18
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,208
Willows green, fly the kite

19
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,958
Willows die, kick the shuttlecock

20
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,583
What were you just singing?

21
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,541
Willows sprout, whip the top

22
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:58,375
Willows green, fly the kite

23
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,541
Willows die, kick the shuttlecock

24
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,791
My Yaor

25
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,208
This is my Yaor

26
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,041
Heaven plays cruel tricks

27
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,041
Madam, our Yaor is alive

28
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,000
Yaor, Yaor

29
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,708
Are you really my Yaor?

30
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,541
Let me ask you again

31
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,958
Where is Liu Yiran’s body?

32
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,833
Stop!

33
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,541
Monk

34
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,916
Was it you who killed Liu Qiaoqiao?

35
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,375
Then why did you gouge out her eyes after killing her?

36
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,666
Are you afraid her vengeful ghost will come for you?

37
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,750
Monk

38
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,291
Do you like me?

39
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,375
Buddha’s teachings cannot save all

40
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,208
You and I can only save ourselves

41
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,791
Monk

42
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,958
Come on

43
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,541
Auntie

44
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,333
Save me

45
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,083
Help me

46
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,375
Scream your lungs out—no one will save you

47
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,583
Come on, come on

48
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:31,958
Sister

49
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,750
Let me do it

50
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,291
That would be best

51
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,708
Qiaoqiao, let's leave this place

52
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,791
We'll never come back

53
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,708
Mm

54
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,125
She's dead

55
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,083
I saw it with my own eyes

56
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,208
We thought we escaped the den of evil

57
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,458
But we fell into another one

58
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,750
But now

59
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,875
I don't want to run anymore

60
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,541
Monk

61
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,000
You can use my corpse as bait

62
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,291
To catch the killer

63
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,666
I haven't married yet

64
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,583
When I die, I wish

65
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,083
To wear a bridal gown

66
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,041
Monk

67
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,458
After I die

68
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,250
Can you gouge out my eyes

69
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,125
I don't want to see this world anymore

70
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,541
So

71
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,708
You used Liu Qiaoqiao's corpse

72
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,083
To lure out the killer of Liu Yiran

73
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,833
I also used illusions

74
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,375
To kill the corpse watcher at the depository

75
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,583
Lin Xiaoran

76
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,583
Tell me

77
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,708
Should I just kill you with one stroke

78
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,583
I think judging the case like this is too hasty

79
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,000
We should examine the body again

80
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,041
So we don't miss any clues

81
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,458
Yaor, Yaor

82
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,208
Sing it again

83
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,625
Sing the nursery rhyme your mother taught you for father, will you?

84
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,833
Not my mother

85
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,000
I have no mother

86
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,083
My sister Liu Yiran taught me

87
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,916
She knew it since she was little
