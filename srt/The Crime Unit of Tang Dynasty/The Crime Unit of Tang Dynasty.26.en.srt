1
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,166
Hurry, chase them!

2
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,291
Wait!

3
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,041
No need to chase.

4
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,666
Where is Prince Kang’s old corpse?

5
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,291
Your Highness.

6
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,041
His Highness is inside.

7
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,166
That old fox.

8
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,208
He fought me his whole life.

9
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,541
Now he’s dead.

10
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,791
I should see him off one last time.

11
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,250
Lead the way.

12
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,833
Prince Kang, oh Prince Kang.

13
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,416
You old bastard.

14
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,125
You fought me all your life.

15
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,750
In the end, you still died by my hand.

16
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,291
I must kill that old traitor.

17
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,625
Right now, the most important thing

18
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,041
is to stop his plot from succeeding.

19
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,833
Someone just came to mind.

20
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,375
Maybe he can help us.

21
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:07,750
I’ll take you to meet him.

22
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:08,958
Li Jingnian.

23
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:11,916
Don’t you think

24
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,958
everything seems connected?

25
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,250
Doesn’t it feel off?

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,250
Lin Xiaoran.

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,291
I brought you to Chang’an.

28
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:26,916
Now,

29
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,125
Shen Qiuwan is missing.

30
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,458
Sorry.

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,208
It’s fine.

32
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,750
As long as it’s your decision,

33
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,250
I’ll follow you.

34
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,000
Mm.

35
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:45,750
Let’s go.

36
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,333
Lord Li, it’s been a while.

37
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,541
What brings you here?

38
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,625
General Song.

39
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,625
I know my foster father trusted you.

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,708
Now Eunuch Qiu’s ambition to seize the throne

41
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,166
is clear to everyone.

42
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,125
And my foster father

43
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,958
has already passed away.

44
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:04,708
What?

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,541
Prince Kang, he...

46
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,791
I barely escaped with my life.

47
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,291
General Song, please lend me your support.

48
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,583
Help me eliminate this traitor.

49
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,416
The palace will be heavily guarded today.

50
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,916
Whether we succeed

51
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,500
depends entirely on the Imperial Guards.

52
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,750
His Highness has deep ties with the Imperial Guards.

53
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,416
This is our duty.

54
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,416
However,

55
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,291
the Imperial Guards aren’t stationed inside the palace.

56
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,708
Without orders, we can’t enter the palace banquet.

57
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,500
We can only deploy outside the palace.

58
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,750
Unless...

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,791
Unless someone inside sends a signal.

60
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,458
Only then can we act.

61
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,375
How about this—

62
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,125
Tomorrow, we split up.

63
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,833
I’ll find a way into the palace.

64
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,791
Expose Eunuch Qiu’s tricks.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,833
The rest

66
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,083
I’ll leave to you.

67
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:00,875
No.

68
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,708
That old eunuch must be prepared inside.

69
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,083
He’s made thorough preparations.

70
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,833
It’s too dangerous for you to go alone.

71
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,208
I’ll go instead.

72
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,125
Lin Xiaoran.

73
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,833
You know

74
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,291
I’m more suited for the palace than you.

75
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,458
Lord Wang.

76
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:27,958
Lord Li.

77
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,541
Please, please.

78
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,333
Lord Li, after you.

79
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,375
It’s been a long time.

80
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,500
How have you been lately?

81
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,625
Very well, very well.

82
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,083
Lord Sun.

83
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,083
You look great after just a few days.

84
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,125
At today’s palace banquet, we must share two cups.

85
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,000
Not at all.

86
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,333
You flatter me.

87
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,791
I heard Lord Sun is busy with official duties today.

88
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,708
Li Jingnian.

89
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,000
I come from the martial world.

90
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,250
Before I met you,

91
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,791
I was always a wanderer in the martial world.

92
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,500
These past months have been joyful.

93
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,708
Once this is over,

94
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,750
come travel the martial world with me.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,708
Sure.

96
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,708
I’ll head out first.

97
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,041
Hyah!

98
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,250
Lin Xiaoran.

99
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,666
Stay within three meters.

100
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,541
Young Hero Lin

101
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,750
Go inside first.

102
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,708
I’ll do my best to find Lady Shen.

103
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,250
Yes.

104
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,083
Why aren’t they here yet?

105
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,125
Yeah.

106
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,333
Why haven’t His Majesty and Eunuch Qiu arrived?

107
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,583
What’s the reason?

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,041
What’s going on?

109
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:58,916
I’m not sure.

110
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,250
Let’s wait a bit longer.

111
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,750
Could it be...

112
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,500
Mind your words!

113
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,125
What time is it already?

114
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,875
We’re almost dead, yet we’re still eating so well.

115
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,541
Qiu Wan

116
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,500
Why are you here?

117
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,625
Prince Kang

118
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,458
Prince Kang is still alive.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,666
This is a trap.

120
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,625
Prince Kang isn't dead, then what about Li Jingnian?

121
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,541
Li Jingnian is in danger.

122
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,583
Hurry!

123
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,916
Go save him!

124
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:30,791
Forget about Li Jingnian for now.

125
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,791
Let me get you out first.

126
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,958
Go save Li Jingnian!

127
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,333
Let me get you out first.

128
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,500
Lin Xiaoran, listen to me.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,416
I'm already like this now.

130
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,791
They won't do anything to me.

131
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,708
Go, or it'll be too late!

132
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,916
Go!

133
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,666
Alright.

134
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,041
I'll go save Li Jingnian first.

135
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,250
Then I'll come back for you.

136
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,583
Wait here for me.

137
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,208
Okay.

138
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,166
I'll be right back.

139
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,500
Strange...

140
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,375
That old fox is always so cautious.

141
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,750
Why is it today, as I walked here,

142
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,791
there's no one guarding the palace?

143
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,666
You're here.

144
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,750
Foster father.

145
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,291
You're alive.

146
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,375
What's going on?

147
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,791
How are you still alive?

148
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,541
Guards!

149
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,041
Kill him!

150
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,166
Why are you all just standing there?

151
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,208
I said, kill him!

152
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,916
So you all...

153
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:08,958
You...

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,291
You guessed right.

155
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,583
They're all my people.

156
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,583
Even the Taoist by your side

157
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,291
is one of mine.

158
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,916
So all of this

159
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,375
was your scheme.

160
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,416
That's right.

161
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,208
If I hadn't done this,

162
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,541
how would you have let your guard down?

163
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,125
And walked right into my trap?

164
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:27,666
You...

165
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,250
Stop your foolish hopes.

166
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,833
I deceived you.

167
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,625
You...

168
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,208
From beginning to end,

169
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,541
you were merely a pawn in my scheme.

170
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,708
Just a stepping stone for my grand ambition.

171
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,541
You...

172
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,916
Impossible!

173
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,250
I'll fight you to the end!

174
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:10,583
I'm the true Dragon!

175
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,416
All of this

176
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,875
was your plot.

177
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,750
Yes.

178
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,166
Why?
