1
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,208
Your Highness

2
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,958
There may be wolves ahead.

3
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,583
Let me send someone to scout ahead.

4
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,666
Just in case.

5
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,791
A few of you come with me.

6
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,666
The rest stay and protect the Princess.

7
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,708
Yes.

8
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,875
The princess disappeared during the marriage alliance.

9
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,125
Li Jingnian, Deputy Chief of the Special Case Bureau,

10
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,791
set out to find the princess.

11
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,041
Within a hundred li around here,

12
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,458
the village ahead is the only one.

13
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,458
They say there was a plague here years ago.

14
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,625
It's probably abandoned now.

15
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,750
The last place the princess was seen

16
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,583
should be nearby. Let's go.

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,375
Mm.

18
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,083
Hey.

19
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,541
Child.

20
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,208
Let me ask you something.

21
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,791
Let's take a look.

22
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,041
Let's go.

23
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,458
Hey, wait!

24
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,125
We live in Jintai Chidingluo.

25
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,041
We traveled far to worship Buddha.

26
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,666
Elder, could you help us?

27
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,750
Old man.

28
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,875
We're here to find someone.

29
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,125
Have you seen this person?

30
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,333
You'd better leave now.

31
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,958
There's no place for you here.

32
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,125
Hey, what treasure will you give me?

33
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,583
Sister has a treasure.

34
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,083
It smells so nice.

35
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:41,875
Help, quickly!

36
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

37
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,166
What happened to Grandpa?

38
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,083
Grandpa is missing.

39
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,625
I think something's wrong.

40
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,375
Stay at home.

41
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,750
We'll go look for your grandpa.

42
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,875
Isn't that the sickly villager we saw at the village entrance earlier?

43
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,541
He was a villager during the day.

44
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,625
Now it's hard to say what he is.

45
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,500
Be careful.
