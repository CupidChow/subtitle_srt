1
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,250
What's wrong?

2
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,583
Xu Luohan still hasn't come back.

3
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,083
Boss, Lin.

4
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,625
I've checked all twenty-one taverns and fifteen gambling dens in and around Chang'an.

5
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,541
I've looked into them all.

6
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,916
No one knows about this token.

7
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,083
Only Ghost Street, which isn't under the court's control, remains unchecked.

8
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,291
Ghost Street.

9
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,833
By day, the living rejoice.

10
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,416
At midnight, the dead open the door.

11
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:48,875
Let's go.

12
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,166
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

13
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,458
Shen Qiuwan hasn't returned yet.

14
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,083
I trust she'll be fine.

15
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:56,708
Keep up.

16
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:00,750
Lin Xiaoran.

17
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,583
Why is the market ahead so lively,

18
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,625
but here all the doors are tightly shut?

19
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,791
The doors outside are just for show.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,583
The real doors are for ghosts.

21
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,875
Naturally, we can't see them.

22
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,458
Qiuwan.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why are you here?

24
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,166
Tell me, who are you?

25
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,958
Shen Wanyan and Madam Shen have disappeared.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,541
I followed the map all the way here.

27
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,250
The map shows there's a gambling den here.

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,375
But no matter how I search, I can't find it.

29
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,916
This is definitely the place.

30
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,250
If we find this place, we'll find clues.

31
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,416
Then we'll know what happened to Madam Shen.

32
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,250
We'll find out.

33
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,750
Old lady.

34
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,166
What are you doing?

35
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,041
No shoes, no outing.

36
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,500
An outing spells trouble.

37
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,333
Are you trying to hint at something?

38
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,041
Sirs,

39
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,375
are you looking for a place?

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,708
Yes.

41
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,250
Come with me.

42
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,416
Enter and perish.

43
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,250
Interesting.

44
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,291
Let's go in and see.

45
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,083
Isn't this a gambling den?

46
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,750
Why does it look like a restaurant?

47
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,916
What's that smell? It's so fragrant.

48
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,500
It's Indian Sandalwood Pear Incense.

49
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,541
It has a calming effect.

50
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,916
This incense is rare.

51
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,041
Ordinary people may never smell it in their lifetime.

52
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,333
There isn't a single guest here.

53
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
It's best not to touch anything.

54
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,333
Better to be cautious.

55
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,958
Let's split up and search.

56
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,291
Lord Li, look.

57
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,166
What's behind this screen?

58
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,291
There's a door here.

59
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,375
I've never seen such a lavish spread at the Cold Case Bureau.

60
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:32,791
Forget it.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,458
There's nothing here.

62
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,875
Let's see if Xu Luohan found anything.

63
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:49,791
Okay.

64
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,000
Where's Xu Luohan?

65
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,625
This food...

66
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,458
Let's get out, something's wrong with the smell.

67
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,458
Wake up!

68
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,458
Where are we?

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,416
Uncle.

70
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,083
Uncle, wake up!

71
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,291
Lord Shen.

72
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,208
Why did she lie to me?

73
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,333
Why did she deceive me?

74
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,125
What's wrong?

75
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,333
He doesn't look right. Let's get out first.

76
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,041
Alright.

77
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,416
Big, Small, Big, Small.

78
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,416
Small, Big, Small.

79
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:09,750

Small.

81
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,916
Small.

82
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,333
Big, Small, Big, Small, Big, Small.

83
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,416
Small, Big, Small, Small.

84
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,750
Big, Small, Big, Small.

85
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,875

00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,041
Small.

89
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,291
Big, Small, Big.

90
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,041
Big, Small, Big, Small.

91
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,875
Big, Small, Big, Small.

00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,791
Big, Big, Small, Big, Small.

93
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:33,750

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,125
I won.

106
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:58,416
I want the most beautiful woman here to devote herself to me.

107
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,333
So beautiful.

108
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,458
So beautiful.

109
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,416
Husband.

110
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,208
Tonight, this humble one belongs to you.

111
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,166
Let's go.

112
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:14,666
Beautiful.

113
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,208
A dream come true, indeed.

114
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,166
Stay in a place like this long enough,

115
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,541
and even a person will turn into a ghost.

116
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,916
Small Small

117
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:21,958

Small

119
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,458
Small. I bet on Small.

120
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,791
Small Small

121
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,875
Small Small Small

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,500

Small

124
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,083
Small

125
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:30,875
Look.

126
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,166
All these gamblers have a totem on their hands.

127
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,291
Small Small Small

128
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,625
It should be this one.

129
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:36,958
Small

130
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,625
Qiuwan.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,541
Take Lord Shen and find a chance to leave first.

132
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,416
We'll go look around.

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,041
Okay.

134
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:42,958
Small

135
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,500
Small

136
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,208
Small

137
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,000
Small

138
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,833
Small

139
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:46,416
Let's go.

140
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,875
Hey, why are you hitting people?

141
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,666
Please, help me.

142
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,291
Let me see the Ghost King.

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,625
Save my child.

144
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,000
Once you enter hell,

145
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,541
you must follow the rules of my Hell Gambling Den.

146
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,833
Otherwise, you'll be thrown into the oil cauldron.

147
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,750
What's going on here?

148
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,625
My name is Sheng Li.

149
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,125
I fled here with my husband.

150
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,208
But my husband and my child

151
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,958
both starved to death on the road.

152
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,875
I heard the Ghost King can save them.

153
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,875
But I had bad luck.

154
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,541
I lost.

155
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,666
They imprisoned me and made me a slave.

156
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,541
I just want to save my child.

157
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,125
I'm begging you, help me.

158
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,291
Help me see the Ghost King.

159
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,125
I'm begging you.

160
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,333
Save my child.

161
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,666
The dead cannot come back to life.

162
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,708
If you want to leave,

163
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,041
I can help you.

164
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,875
Oh, which young man is playing the hero?

165
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,750
Trying to break the rules of my gambling den?

166
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,333
What kind of bullshit rules does your gambling den have?

167
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,916
This is hell.

168
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,041
Only those driven by greed and evil come here.

169
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,750
Even if you cut out their hearts, they'd still be black.

170
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,208
Instead of worrying about others,

171
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,000
you should worry about yourselves.

172
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:29,666
What do you mean?

173
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,083
Three quarters past midnight.

174
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,541
The life-and-death gamble begins.

175
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,583
The winner meets the Ghost King.

176
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,666
The loser is forever damned to hell.

177
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,625
Lord Wang.

178
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,916
Lord Li.

179
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,333
Luohan.
