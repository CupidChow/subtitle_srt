1
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,166
This round is big.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,916
Then I'll guess small.

3
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,500
Thank you, Young Master.

4
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,833
Thank you, Young Master.

5
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,833
Let's continue.

6
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,208
Big.

7
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:40,791
Li Jingnian.

8
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,333
If you keep guessing like this,

9
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,291
Xu Luohan will lose his life.

10
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,625
This round is small.

11
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,375
As expected, every man for himself.

12
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,291
Or heaven and earth will destroy him.

13
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,083
You win this round.

14
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,250
Young Master.

15
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,583
You've already helped me.

16
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,916
Even if you defeat me,

17
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,708
I have no regrets.

18
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,708
What a sincere and kind girl.

19
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,375
Li Jingnian.

20
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,583
Do you really want to destroy her

21
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,791
just to save your brother?

22
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,208
Lord Ghost King, you are mistaken.

23
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,833
All this fighting is so dull.

24
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,791
Let's play something else.

25
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,541
How bold.

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,166
Release Lord Ghost King's hand.

27
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,875
Forgive my rudeness.

28
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,416
Lin Xiaoran, what are you doing?

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,625
The game continues.

30
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,416
This round is small.

31
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,333
Let's say it together later.

32
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:24,750
Small.

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,583
Big.

34
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,541
You win.

35
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,291
Then she

36
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,916
must spend her life trapped in my hell.

37
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,083
Honor the bet.

38
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,208
You all

39
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,250
must not interfere with her affairs again.

40
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,208
Beat them!

41
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,208
Young Master, please save me!

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,083
Young Master, save me!

43
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,791
Why? Why is it me?

44
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,000
Sheng Li.

45
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,708
Are you still going to pretend?

46
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,125
You are the real Ghost King.

47
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,458
Young Master, what are you saying?

48
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,458
Since we've all won,

49
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,416
why should Lord Ghost King keep pretending?

50
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,291
Honor the bet.

51
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,375
Isn't that the rule of your Hell Gambling Den?

52
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,083
You say I'm the Ghost King.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,250
What proof do you have?

54
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,875
Ever since we entered the Shen residence,

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,416
we've been caught in the trap set by Lord Ghost King.

56
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,166
The riddles seemed rushed,

57
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,625
but it was all to lure us in.

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,916
Come with me.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Your scheme is clever.

60
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,458
But you forgot I'm a wanderer of the martial world.

61
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,708
Without some skills,

62
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,125
how could I survive out here?

63
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,250
Is your wrist still comfortable?

64
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,291
This

65
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,041
is my own Itching Powder.

66
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,583
From the Ghost Market until now,

67
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,833
the only one who got close to us

68
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,666
was that old lady.

69
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,500
So you

70
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,875
are that old lady.

71
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:29,958
We almost

72
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,500
fell for your brilliant acting.

73
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,416
But I never lied to you.

74
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,750
You, like him,

75
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,833
are truly helping me.

76
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,708
I won't make things difficult for you today.

77
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,666
As long as you sign the pledge,

78
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,083
and swear loyalty to the gambling den,

79
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,291
I'll release Xu Luohan.

80
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,208
The Ghost King used himself as bait.

81
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,083
Do you still want to keep acting?

82
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,000
I did not.

83
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,125
Everything I said is true.

84
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,625
I was once a maid in the home of a former imperial secretary.

85
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,125
A lowly maid.

86
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,458
How could I dare love my master?

87
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,708
The young master forced himself on me.

88
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,625
I became pregnant.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,625
But Madam couldn't tolerate me.

90
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
She not only took my child away,

91
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,500
but locked me in the dungeon for years.

92
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,583
To me,

93
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,166
that was true hell on earth.

94
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,083
But I held hatred in my heart.

95
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,416
I hate all the heartless men in this world.

96
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,208
I wish I could tear them apart and swallow them whole.

97
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,791
Finally, one day,

98
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,375
I escaped.

99
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,833
I despise how unjust the heavens are.

100
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,666
So I want everyone to experience it.

101
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,041
The taste of hell.

102
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,083
To feel the pain of being abandoned by the world.

103
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,125
This Hell Gambling Den

104
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,458
is a place my husband and I built together.

105
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,291
He once said

106
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,083
everything here is up to me.

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,375
No one will ever betray me again.

108
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,166
If you truly help me today,

109
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,500
I won't make things difficult for you.

110
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,375
Don't dress up your evil deeds

111
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,208
with such high-sounding words.

112
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,791
What is good?

113
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,375
What is evil?

114
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,250
Is sacrificing me to save your own brother considered good?

115
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,625
I advise you not to be ungrateful.

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,041
Do you really think

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,416
that girl

118
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,541
can escape?

119
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,083
Qiu Wan!

120
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,208
Let me go!

121
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,125
Help! Somebody help!

122
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,291
Come here, bitch!

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,625
Let me go! Help!

124
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,458
Don't go!

125
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,416
She's not Madam Shen.

126
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,083
Behave yourself.

127
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,083
She is my wife.

128
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,500
Madam.

129
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,291
She's not.

130
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:43,875
Go.

131
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,708
She is.

132
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,875
You're lying to me again.
