1
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,208
All of this

2
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,541
was your scheme.

3
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:58,833
Yes.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,125
Why?

5
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,625
Why?

6
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,791
The throne should have been mine from the start.

7
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,625
But the late emperor took it from me.

8
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,458
Everything I’ve done

9
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,250
was to reclaim what was rightfully mine.

10
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,000
So, the Liuxiang Pavilion in Luoyang

11
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,083
and the Changan County Gambling Den

12
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,833
you knew about them all along.

13
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,250
Eunuch Qiu wanted to use these two places

14
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,458
to control officials both in and out of court.

15
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,375
How could I not know?

16
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,125
How long have you been planning this?

17
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,041
Sending us into the palace to steal the mirror

18
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:34,916
was also part of your plan.

19
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,958
That's right.

20
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,166
Everything

21
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,375
was within my calculations.

22
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,375
Having you do these things

23
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,875
was simply convenient

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,291
for me to monitor your every move.

25
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,416
So that Qiu De would trust

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,958
the matter of the Xuanyuan Mirror.

27
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,000
All along,

28
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,416
he was just one step away from usurping the throne.

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,541
He only needed a final spark.

30
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,958
And this mirror

31
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,291
was the fuse I prepared for him.

32
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,166
What a pity.

33
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,958
Eunuch Qiu never imagined

34
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,916
the palace banquet coup he plotted

35
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,000
would end up benefiting me.

36
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,125
Foster father,

37
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,625
you truly are mad.

38
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,083
This is treason.

39
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,958
This is following the will of heaven.

40
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,541
The Tang Dynasty is on the brink of collapse.

41
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,625
The people need a savior.

42
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,291
to restore the Tang Dynasty.

43
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,791
And I

44
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,375
am the most suitable person for that.

45
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,708
You don’t have to sit on the throne

46
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,250
to serve the country and its people.

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,583
All these years,

48
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,958
I kept telling myself

49
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,416
to be a good subject,

50
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,291
to fulfill my duty,

51
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,500
to serve the nation and the people,

52
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,875
and not to fight for anything.

53
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,750
But in the end,

54
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,416
the court declined and eunuchs took power.

55
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,916
Jingnian,

56
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,541
you must believe me.

57
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,083
Only I

58
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,500
am worthy of the throne.

59
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,583
When I ascend the throne,

60
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,708
the scholars of Guming Villa

61
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:13,000
will praise my virtue and legitimacy to the world.

62
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,833
The Xuanyuan Mirror, in accordance with heaven,

63
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,333
will grant me imperial authority.

64
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,000
The hearts of all under heaven

65
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,666
will submit to me.

66
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,625
So,

67
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,916
this was your true purpose in taking over Guming Villa.

68
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,500
You had planned it all along

69
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,416
to have those scholars serve your grand plan.

70
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,125
To spread word of your ambitions.

71
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,708
If I’m not mistaken,

72
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,666
the book "Treatise on Governing the State" held by Magistrate Sun of Fuping County

73
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,833
was also given to you, wasn’t it?

74
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:41,583
Yes.

75
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,500
That's right.

76
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,958
Use people as tools,

77
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,750
and one can attain the way of immortals.

78
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,500
But use the state as a tool,

79
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,250
and one can rule all under heaven.

80
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,041
General, please step aside.

81
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,458
Young hero Lin,

82
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,083
I advise you to stay here quietly.

83
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,458
At least you’ll have a chance to live.

84
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,083
Fine.

85
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,541
I

86
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,291
will stay here.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,250
But what about Li Jingnian?

88
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,791
He’s almost finished, isn’t he?

89
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,708
Take him down.

90
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,916
Lin Xiaoran

91
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,375
So

92
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
That Xuanyuan Mirror

93
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,250
will reveal the true dragon’s visage no matter who looks into it.

94
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,541
You just need to

95
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,125
show your dragon’s visage to all the officials at the palace banquet.

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,541
Then your plan will succeed, right?

97
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,083
Yes.

98
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,625
You’re absolutely right.

99
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,208
Foster father

100
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,083
Enough.

101
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,708
Qiuwan

102
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,041
Where is Lin Xiaoran?

103
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,250
What have you done to him?

104
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,541
I know you can’t accept all this.

105
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,333
But my patience is limited.

106
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,458
If you don’t help me,

107
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,875
I’ll kill her.

108
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,875
I’m giving you

109
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,750
only one chance.

110
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,500
Lin Xiaoran

111
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,500
The righteous path you hold onto

112
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,166
I will fulfill it for you.

113
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,708
Qiuwan

114
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,041
Qiuwan

115
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,625
Qiuwan

116
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,875
Qiuwan

117
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,833
Qiuwan

118
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,541
Shen Qiuwan

119
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,250
Shen Qiuwan

120
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,666
The Tang Dynasty belongs to the people.

121
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,166
It’s not yours.

122
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,875
It’s the Emperor.

123
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,250
The Emperor is here.

124
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,666
It’s the Emperor.

125
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,625
The Emperor has arrived.

126
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,791
Emperor! Emperor!

127
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,958
This is the legendary Xuanyuan Mirror.

128
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,375
If our Emperor obtains this mirror,

129
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,125
he is the chosen savior of Heaven.

130
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,708
Heaven blesses the Tang Dynasty.

131
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:30,166
Long live the Emperor!

132
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,541
Lord Li

133
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,041
I'm investigating supernatural cases among the common folk.

134
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,166
Wherever evil spirits arise,

135
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,791
you'll find me, Lin Xiaoran.

136
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,375
Lin Xiaoran.

137
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,458
I’m giving you two choices now.

138
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,125
First,

139
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,250
stay and help me with the investigation.

140
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,166
I choose the second.

141
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,375
Be generous, be generous, be generous.

142
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,458
Don’t push it.

143
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,750
Lin Xiaoran and I

144
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,166
have been orphans since childhood.

145
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,375
We’ve endured endless humiliation.

146
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,791
Wandering the world with a sword

147
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,416
is my choice.

148
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,166
Everyone

149
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,000
has their own mission.

150
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,541
Take my boss and leave first.

151
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,000
Luo Han.

152
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,583
Li Jingnian.

153
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,708
Once this is over,

154
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,416
come join me for an adventure in the martial world.

155
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:04,916
Hey.

156
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,916
Now that the world is at peace,

157
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,125
do you want to join me for some fun in the martial world?

158
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,125
Sure.
