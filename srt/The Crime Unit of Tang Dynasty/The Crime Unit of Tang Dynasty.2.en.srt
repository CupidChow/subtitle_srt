1
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,375
Come on.

2
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,041
Please, let me go.

3
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:58,833
Madam.

4
00:00:59,083 --> 00:00:59,916
Help me.

5
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,833
Save me.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,708
Hmph.

7
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:07,833
Come on.

8
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,958
Don't worry, Your Honor.

9
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,208
I'll solve the case for you within three days.

10
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,541
Let me tell you,

11
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,416
Don't try any tricks.

12
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,583
You must stay within ten feet of me for these three days.

13
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,458
Oh, by the way,

14
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,916
Now there are only two days left.

15
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,875
Is your master at home?

16
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,541
My master...

17
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,416
He's missing.

18
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,625
What a coincidence.

19
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,625
And you're here too.

20
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,750
We invited the Buddhist Monk from the temple to perform last rites for Madam.

21
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,500
Just like the old coroner who died at the mortuary last night.

22
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,916
He was literally scared to death.

23
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,791
I arrived late, please forgive me.

24
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:31,875
Magistrate Sun.

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,125
Has your wife been comforted?

26
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,375
It's a family matter.

27
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,916
I wouldn't dare delay the investigation.

28
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,000
Your Excellency.

29
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,750
I heard Liu Gui is missing.

30
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

31
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,958
Liu Gui came to steal the corpse.

32
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,291
But he vanished along with the corpse in the mansion.

33
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,791
And Madam Liu was scared to death.

34
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,625
The whole Liu family

35
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,125
is quite strange.

36
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,250
I heard from the steward

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,166
that besides the missing Liu Yanran and the deceased Liu Qiaoqiao,

38
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,708
Liu Gui also has a mute adopted daughter named Liu Jiaojiao.

39
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,333
It must be her.

40
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,750
Is she possessed or something?

41
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,416
Please don't be offended, Your Honor.

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,291
My lady has always been like this.

43
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,500
She laughs when she wants to cry.

44
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,083
Everyone says she has a strange illness.

45
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,166
The greatest form is formless.

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,583
The greatest sorrow is tearless.

47
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,583
Leave her to me, the humble monk.

48
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,458
Monk.

49
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,541
On the day of the incident,

50
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,458
how many times did you see Miss Liu?

51
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,208
Do you know anything?

52
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,416
Useless brat.

53
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,541
You even spilled the foot-washing basin.

54
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,208
You kneel here properly today.

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,583
Hold the basin up for me.

56
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,333
If you spill even a drop,

57
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,250
don't ever think of entering the Liu household again.

58
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:27,916
Father.

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,750
Sister was just distracted for a moment.

60
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,333
Please forgive her.

61
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,333
Living Buddha.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,583
In this life,

63
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,291
are we destined to suffer endlessly?

64
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,000
It's hard to find a perfect solution in this world.

65
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,583
Miss Liu Yanran is a good person.

66
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,166
She often gives alms at the temple.

67
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,750
Over time,

68
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,208
she also got to know her sister Liu Qiaoqiao.

69
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,333
But fate played a cruel trick.

70
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,625
Are there any other strange things in your mansion?

71
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,208
My master rarely sleeps with Madam.

72
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,458
No one is allowed into his room.

73
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,750
It's quite comfortable.

74
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,708
Boss.

75
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,333
Boss.

76
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,625
At the home of the deceased mortuary coroner,

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,833
we found a bathtub.

78
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,416
What?

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,416
A mortuary coroner

80
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,791
used his job as a cover to steal corpses.

81
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,208
I can't believe right under our noses

82
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,041
there was such a villain.

83
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,666
Your Excellency.

84
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,375
Maybe he's the murderer.

85
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,583
Liu Gui's disappearance and Madam Liu's death

86
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,791
probably have nothing to do with him.

87
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,291
Magistrate Sun.

88
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,583
Leave matters here to us.

89
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,333
As for the mortuary coroner,

90
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,166
look further into his background.

91
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,916
Rest assured, Your Excellency.

92
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,500
Yes.

93
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,291
So, Charlatan, what do you think?

94
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,125
Any new discoveries?

95
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,125
I'm staying here tonight.

96
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,041
From now on,

97
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,583
I am Liu Gui.

98
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,125
I'm going to sleep in my own bed.

99
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,625
Think about what he's planning.

100
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,083
What are you doing?

101
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:28,958
Sir Li.

102
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,791
We may not have much time left.

103
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,916
Liu Qiaoqiao has already undergone corpse transformation.

104
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,083
Why don't you give it a try too?

105
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,458
You mean...

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,041
Tonight,

107
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,041
you want me to sleep with you?

108
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,541
Inside or outside, you choose.

109
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,750
I'm not sleeping.

110
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,500
Relax, Sir Li.

111
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,416
Shut up.

112
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:51,750
Shh.

113
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,750
What's wrong?

114
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,541
There's a ghost outside. It's about to come in.

115
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,375
Sorry, Your Honor.

116
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,583
My lady often wanders around at night.

117
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,416
Luo Han

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,125
Did you find anything?

119
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,375
Boss, there's nothing useful at all.

120
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,583
Let me take a look.

121
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,750
Using objects as vessels,

122
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,458
can create the spirit of all things.

123
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,583
Using people as vessels,

124
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,000
is the way to immortality.

125
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,875
It describes an esoteric art.

126
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,708
It uses the corpse of a woman born at a yin hour as a vessel.

127
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,291
It has miraculous effects on those with hidden ailments.

128
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,833
That beast Liu Gui used the corpses of his adopted daughters

129
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,250
to make a corpse bed.

130
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,333
So that mortuary old man covered in sores

131
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,833
had the same purpose.

132
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,000
Killing to attain enlightenment.

133
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,666
So, from this perspective,

134
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,750
this isn't a ghost case.

135
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a human case.

136
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,500
Charlatan.

137
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:16,958
You lost.

138
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll notify the magistrate to arrest Liu Gui.

139
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,791
Alright.

140
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,583
What are you thinking about?

141
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,166
This case is far from simple.

142
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,916
I'm thinking about the mute girl who was spying last night.

143
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,333
Maybe she was trying to tell us something.

144
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,041
Where is she?

145
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,958
I just saw her here.

146
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,166
Boss, what's going on?

147
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,250
We were about to arrest Liu Gui,

148
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,833
but someone killed him first.

149
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,750
Could it be...

150
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,375
Did Liu Qiaoqiao really reanimate and kill him?

151
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,208
Your Excellency,

152
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,833
do you think this is a human case or a ghost case now?

153
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,125
I can't believe Liu Gui was right under our noses.

154
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,666
Your Excellency, what should we do next?

155
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,291
How is the investigation on the mortuary old man?

156
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,750
Reporting to Your Excellency,

157
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,750
I found that the corpse watcher

158
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,041
has been secretly seeking esoteric arts.

159
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,875
Trying every method to cure his skin disease.

160
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:44,916
As expected.

161
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,125
He and Liu Gui

162
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,625
were practicing the same dark arts from that strange book.

163
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,583
But Liu Gui,

164
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,166
who killed him?

165
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,416
I believe

166
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,875
the coroner should examine Liu Gui's body carefully.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,625
To determine what hidden ailment Liu Gui had.

168
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,416
That required using dark arts and a corpse bed to resolve.

169
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,666
Understood.

170
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,791
You may leave now. Let me think it over.

171
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,291
Alright.

172
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:08,958
By the way,

173
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,458
Is your wife well lately?

174
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,666
Thank you for your concern, Your Excellency.

175
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,875
My wife is doing well.

176
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,583
Master, please come this way.

177
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,916
Both of these people died tragically.

178
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,125
Let me perform last rites for them.

179
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,125
It seems

180
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,125
besides Liu Gui and the mortuary old man,

181
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,250
there's a third person obsessed with the dark arts in that book.

182
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,083
Trying to attain enlightenment through corpses.

183
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,041
Let me ask you something.

184
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,791
That monk—

185
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,666
Has he ever visited your residence before today?

186
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,291
I remember now.

187
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,958
I saw him one night.
