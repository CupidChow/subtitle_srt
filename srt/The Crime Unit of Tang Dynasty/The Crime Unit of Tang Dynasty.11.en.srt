1
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,125
Alright, don't be afraid.

2
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,583
As far as I know,

3
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,416
Teng Rong died around 9 to 11 pm last night.

4
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,541
What were you two doing at that time? Please tell me.

5
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,791
Young Hero Lin,

6
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,083
My wife was just frightened.

7
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,833
Could you speak more gently?

8
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,458
It's alright, my dear.

9
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,583
Young Hero Lin is just doing his duty.

10
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,666
It's fine.

11
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,708
Last night...

12
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,375
I was taking a bath.

13
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,916
Unexpectedly,

14
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,583
Teng Rong barged in.

15
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,750
Senior Sister,

16
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,083
Madam,

17
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,458
Madam,

18
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,375
What's wrong, Madam?

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,291
Dear, Teng Rong...

20
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,250
Teng Rong was peeking at me while I bathed.

21
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,916
He peeked at you bathing?

22
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,708
That bastard Teng Rong!

23
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,958
Are you sure it was Teng Rong who peeked at you last night?

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,750
Yes, though the lighting was dim that night.

25
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,583
My husband chased after him and caught him quickly.

26
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,083
That's right.

27
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,375
Last night...

28
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,583
Stop!

29
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:02,958
Second Brother,

30
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,375
Teng Rong, you bastard!

31
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,541
How dare you do such a vile thing to your Senior Sister!

32
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:08,833
Lian Songbai,

33
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't think you can bully me just because you have the Lian family behind you.

34
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,083
That gives you no right to insult me.

35
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm now Lord Gao's adopted son.

36
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,416
My status is no less than yours.

37
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,916
Don't think I don't know your relationship with Lord Gao.

38
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,166
You're just someone he keeps for his own amusement.

39
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,083
You...

40
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:28,500
So Teng Rong's claim of being an official's adopted son was all made up.

41
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,500
That's right.

42
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,791
Then do you know why your junior Teng Rong

43
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,541
was worshipping a corpse?

44
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,125
What?

45
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,291
He was worshipping a corpse?

46
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,500
It's time for you to speak, Young Master Gao.

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,000
Around 9 to 11 pm last night,

48
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,458
what exactly were you doing?

49
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,583
This is my manor's unique tea brewing technique.

50
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,500
Most people don't understand its subtleties.

51
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,500
Young Hero Lin, have a taste.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,166
You've been using tea to dodge questions.

53
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,833
Could it be that you're the ghost?

54
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,625
How crude.

55
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,000
Where were you before the incident?

56
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,958
Last night, I was playing chess with my master in the room.

57
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,625
We played until midnight before leaving.

58
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,916
Who won?

59
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,833
Three games, I lost every one.

60
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,458
But losing to my master

61
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,125
is an honor for me.

62
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,416
Everyone is hiding something.

63
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,750
Who really killed you?

64
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,541
What happened today is truly strange.

65
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,916
Young Hero Lin, are you trying to get information from me?

66
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,708
A ghost taps your shoulder,

67
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,458
your days are numbered.

68
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,416
Darn it.

69
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,916
How could Steward Wang...

70
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,500
Master! Master! Master!

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,291
He's been with me for over ten years.

72
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,000
Master, Manor Lord, Master!

73
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,208
Help the Manor Lord back to rest first.

74
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,416
Alright.

75
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,666
Young Master Gao, I have something to ask you.

76
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,083
Speak plainly.

77
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,041
Actually, I just asked the Manor Lord.

78
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:14,333
He said you won two games and lost one yesterday.

79
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,708
Did you not get your stories straight, or...

80
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,541
Then I want to ask you instead.

81
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,583
Why did you rush to send Master away just now?

82
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,708
Instead of letting the three of us confront each other?

83
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,291
As for me,

84
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,500
I know Master's character well.

85
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,333
He values the manor's reputation above all.

86
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,916
Now that someone has died here,

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,041
he would never let an outsider interfere.

88
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,333
Young Master Gao,

89
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,958
Aren't you afraid

90
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,916
you'll be next?

91
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,708
My conscience is clear; I fear nothing.

92
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,666
You should worry about yourself.

93
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,166
Charming

94
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,625
Truly charming

95
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,791
Husband

96
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,791
I'm scared

97
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,333
Don't be afraid, my lady

98
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,500
Whether the killer is human or ghost

99
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,916
if they want to harm you

100
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,041
they'll have to get past me first

101
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,958
Don't say that, husband

102
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,625
I know you care about me

103
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,916
But you must be careful too

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,250
Don't worry, my lady

105
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,833
You should rest first

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,125
I'll go find Master

107
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,041
Alright

108
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,791
Darling

109
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,083
You're annoying

110
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,000
Look at the situation we're in

111
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,916
And you still think about this

112
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,625
Oh, what are you afraid of

113
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,125
At times like this

114
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,083
you're the most tempting

115
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,708
Senior Brother

116
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,416
Yes

117
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,166
Let's run away

118
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,291
I keep feeling

119
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,583
this is aimed at the two of us

120
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,500
Our affair

121
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,000
If my husband finds out

122
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,958
So we should just escape together

123
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,666
Escape?

124
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,833
Why should I run away

125
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,625
Lian Songbai inherited the Lian family business

126
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,500
Now there's a vengeful spirit killing people

127
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,833
I can use the spirit to kill him

128
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,875
Then we can be together, just the two of us

129
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,666
Isn't that the perfect plan

130
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,833
You want to kill Lian Songbai

131
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,458
Of course I don't want to dirty my own hands

132
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,416
I'll let the spirit do it

133
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,708
Besides

134
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,791
With you as my witness

135
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,500
What do I have to fear

136
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,541
My husband is your junior brother after all

137
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,916
You really are ruthless

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,875
What's wrong

139
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,583
You act like a witch and still pretend to be virtuous

140
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,583
Let me tell you

141
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,750
Even if we run away

142
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,166
How could a poor scholar like me support you

143
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,541
I'm doing all this for us

144
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,333
It's all for us

145
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,041
Let go of me

146
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,416
Stay away from me

147
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,333
You're not doing this for us at all

148
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,583
You just want the Lian family fortune

149
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,791
Gao Li, you're a scoundrel

150
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,500
You filthy witch, don't know what's good for you, do you

151
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,583
Gao Li

152
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,250
I never thought you, so well-dressed

153
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,458
would be a scoundrel stealing another's wife

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,541
Husband, save me

155
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,541
Junior Brother Lian

156
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,750
Why ruin our brotherhood over a woman

157
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,291
and destroy our bond

158
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,750
My lady, have you treated me fairly

159
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,500
No, it's not like that

160
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,250
It was him, Gao Li

161
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,708
He's a scoundrel

162
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,541
He not only covets the Lian family fortune

163
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,500
he also forced me

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,416
If I didn't obey him

165
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,875
he would kill both of us

166
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,625
You filthy witch, you're slandering me

167
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,000
Gao Li

168
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,541
Only today have I truly seen your true face

169
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,125
Bastard, I'll kill you

170
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,333
Stop

171
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,708
Everyone, stop

172
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,583
I said stop

173
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,083
This room is filthy

174
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,083
So filthy

175
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,291
Gao Li, you are all vile and base

176
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,875
How can you still call yourself my disciple, Ouyang Ming's disciple

177
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,583
Last night, I played chess with you until midnight

178
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,208
I thought you were upright

179
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,458
But I never expected you to do such disgraceful things

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,791
Last night, I clearly

181
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,750
Last night, Wang Zheng mentioned you and He Yun

182
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,708
I even told him not to speak nonsense

183
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,375
But

184
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,166
I never expected

185
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,083
You really are a hypocrite

186
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,791
Even your junior brother's wife

187
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,291
You dare to touch her

188
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,625
Manor Lord

189
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,000
Anger harms the body, anger harms the body

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,625
I'll deal with you later

191
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,083
Husband

192
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,416
I have lived my life with integrity.

193
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,208
All I ever wanted was for this Manor,

194
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,250
to be a pure land for scholars and poets.

195
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,541
But now, I never expected

196
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,625
that my own disciples

197
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,958
would turn out to be such scoundrels.

198
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,250
Manor Lord,

199
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,583
what are you really hiding?

200
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,583
Including the unidentified body at the birthday banquet,

201
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,500
there are now three deaths in total.

202
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,791
If this continues,

203
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,333
this Manor may soon become a place haunted by vengeful spirits.

204
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,791
Do not speak nonsense.

205
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:45,333
This Manor is a pure land away from the world.

206
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,458
How could there be vengeful ghosts here?

207
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,208
A pure land away from the world?

208
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,000
Young Master Gao,

209
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,625
even your master no longer protects you.

210
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,375
Will you still keep hiding the truth?
