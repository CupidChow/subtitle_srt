1
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,416
What are you doing?

2
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,875
What are you all doing?

3
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,708
Go.

4
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:08,916
I'm not going.

5
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,833
You bunch of wretches.

6
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,000
Let go.

7
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,916
Let me go.

8
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,125
Let me go.

9
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,750
See, we're back again.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,791
What do you want to do?

11
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,208
What do you think?

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,041
Girls,

13
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,291
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,250
The water in this pool can keep you young forever.

15
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,291
Yunjin.

16
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,458
Did you see that?

17
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,916
This is what happens after leaving the pool.

18
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,041
Keep her here.

19
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,583
Let the girls remember this fate at all times.

20
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,208
This powder made from gu-poison insects

21
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,875
can ease your pain for a while.

22
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,833
Do you want it?

23
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,625
Listen up, all of you.

24
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,625
Only obedient girls deserve this powder.

25
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,208
It's up to you how to act.

26
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,708
Don't go! The powder, the powder!

27
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,791
My face...

28
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,791
Sister! Sister!

29
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,833
Yunjin.

30
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,250
Help!

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,791
Li Jingnian.

32
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,583
Do you know why, even though I sensed something was wrong with those women,

33
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,000
I chose to hide it from you?

34
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,375
Because you have secrets in your heart.

35
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,083
I'll deal with you later.

36
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,750
No.

37
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,875
Because you only see things as black or white.

38
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,708
You don't know that even ghosts can be good or evil.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,458
What if the one who harms others is also a victim?

40
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,041
The laws of the Great Tang

41
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,291
will bring justice to the world.

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,375
There's a place like this in Liuxiang Pavilion?

43
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,291
Chunxiang, where's Madam?

44
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,583
She went where she belongs.

45
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,583
She caused all these deaths.

46
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,666
Any girl tortured to death by guests in the Black Room

47
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,916
was buried here by her.

48
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,916
They were once our sisters too.

49
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,833
So the bodies in Liuxiang Pavilion

50
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,375
were all dug up by you from here?

51
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,875
That's right.

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,083
Lord Li, you are a good official.

53
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,416
But a just official can't outwit the wicked.

54
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,291
So what do you want to do?

55
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,208
Let us decide our own fate.

56
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,375
Wretch!

57
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,750
How dare you pretend to be a ghost in the Black Room and scare my guest to death!

58
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:06,583
Madam.

59
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,083
Guests may break the rules,

60
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,166
but you cannot.

61
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,333
All of you, stab her!

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,166
Spare me, Madam!

63
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,041
Madam, Madam, please spare me!

64
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,333
If you won't stab her, I'll kill her myself.

65
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,666
Didn't you say if we stab her, you won't kill her?

66
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,166
Remember this, all of you.

67
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,750
Anyone who dares harm a guest in the future

68
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,125
will end up like her.

69
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,166
We must escape.

70
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,625
Dongmei! Dongmei! Dongmei!

71
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,875
We must escape.

72
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,208
Lord Li, you've seen everything now.

73
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,416
We did kill those people in Liuxiang Pavilion.

74
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,000
We

75
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,791
are indeed a group of ghosts who can't face the light.

76
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,541
Lord Li.

77
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,708
If a life must pay for a life,

78
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,875
then take mine.

79
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,125
My sister

80
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,916
is already dead.

81
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,625
I'm content to have you all as my sisters.

82
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,000
Live well for me.

83
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,666
Your lives

84
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,083
should never be controlled by others again.

85
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,250
Wannning.

86
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,125
Wannning.

87
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:40,958
Sister.

88
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,125
Wannning.

89
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,666
Li Jingnian.

90
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,541
I know there's someone even more powerful behind this Madam.

91
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,625
But...

92
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,958
Can you let them go, or

93
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,000
just lock them up for a few days?

94
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,708
Lin Xiaoran.

95
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,791
Do you really think

96
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm that kind of person?

97
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,833
It's not about what I think.

98
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,791
It's about what you do.

99
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,833
Lin Xiaoran.

100
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,041
You underestimate me.

101
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,333
We are both women,

102
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,375
yet you wander the martial world with a sword.

103
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,833
I truly envy you, Lady Shen.

104
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,500
Traveling the world with my sword is my choice.

105
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
But you all

106
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,208
have bravely fought against your fate.

107
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,416
What’s wrong?

108
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,166
I was just thinking about the past.

109
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,916
Lin Xiaoran and I have been orphans since childhood.

110
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,208
We suffered endless humiliation.

111
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,208
But compared to these girls,

112
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,750
I suddenly feel much more fortunate.

113
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,333
I hope things like this happen less often.

114
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,625
Among those guests,

115
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,916
many are corrupt officials who feign death to escape justice.

116
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,625
This must be connected to the imperial court.

117
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,833
Whoever is behind this, don’t even think about it.

118
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,000
Hey, there you go again.

119
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,041
I was just starting to see you differently.

120
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,208
Can you just—

121
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,375
Now you’re back to this.

122
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,125
Can’t you change your way of thinking?

123
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,916
Fine, then.

124
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,000
I need to take care of something first.

125
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,000
There’s a manor ahead.

126
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,833
The owner is acquainted with my father.

127
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,208
You can wait for me there.

128
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,791
Alright, Lady Shen,

129
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,583
are you coming with me

130
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,083
or with Lord Li?

131
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,875
I’ll go with the most handsome.

132
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,458
Let’s go, Lord Li.

133
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,916
Am I not handsome?

134
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,458
Help! Save me!

135
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,416
Useless.

136
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,958
Yafu entrusted you with managing Liuxiang Pavilion.

137
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,416
You were supposed to keep those temporarily dismissed officials under control.

138
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,500
To build connections and power for future plans.

139
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,666
But what did you do?

140
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,083
You ruined Yafu’s grand scheme.
