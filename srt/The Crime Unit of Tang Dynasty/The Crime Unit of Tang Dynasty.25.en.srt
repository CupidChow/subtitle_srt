1
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,416
I don't know.

2
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,916
How much longer will Eunuch keep watching us like this?

3
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,916
Clean up properly.

4
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:12,708
Yes.

5
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,458
Yes.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,250
Go ahead.

7
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:20,875
Let's go.

8
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,958
Lord Li, please come this way.

9
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,666
Isn't His Majesty in the Imperial Study?

10
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,833
His Majesty has a headache from reading today.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,583
He's resting in the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

12
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,083
He knew you were coming.

13
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,916
He asked me to guide you here.

14
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,708
Thank you for your trouble, Eunuch.

15
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,083
Where do you think that old thief hid the item?

16
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,125
That old man...

17
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,583
Could he have hidden the mirror on himself?

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,541
That's why we can't find it no matter how we search.

19
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,166
It's possible.

20
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,625
If it's on him,

21
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,291
we'll have to get close to him.

22
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,291
Hurry up, everyone!

23
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,166
Don't keep Father Protector waiting.

24
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,208
Serving Father Protector is your good fortune.

25
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,750
You should cherish it.

26
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,875
Eunuch Qiu.

27
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,750
What are they whispering about?

28
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,666
That room definitely holds a secret.

29
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,083
What are we waiting for?

30
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,208
Let's go.

31
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,916
Li Jingnian, your servant.

32
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,625
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

33
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,166
Li Jingnian, your servant.

34
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,791
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,875
You're not Eunuch Qiu.

36
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,083
Where is His Majesty?

37
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,125
This is bad.

38
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,708
Lin Xiaoran.

39
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,375
You.

40
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,791
Go inside.

41
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:39,708
Yes.

42
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:44,708
You.

43
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,541
Wait at the door.

44
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,250
Useless thing.

45
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,291
Why are your hands shaking?

46
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,875
Why aren't you afraid of me?

47
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,250
Father Protector holds the greatest power in this world.

48
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,875
I believe

49
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:31,958
only Father Protector

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,041
can truly be called a real man.

51
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,833
You really know how to flatter.

52
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,666
Come, step forward.

53
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,291
I am awed by your commanding presence.

54
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,458
To serve you

55
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,125
is my greatest fortune.

56
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,750
Why would I be afraid?

57
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,750
You just said

58
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,750
I am a real man.

59
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,083
They're all still here.

60
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,333
All of you, leave.

61
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,458
Yes.

62
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,875
Is that better, beauty?

63
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,041
Father Protector,

64
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,583
why not

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,708
let's play something interesting.

66
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,541
What do you want to play, little beauty?

67
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,083
Within the time it takes for an incense stick to burn,

68
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,291
if you can catch me,

69
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,625
I am yours to command.

70
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,375
You said it yourself.

71
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes.

72
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,541
I did.

73
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm right here.

74
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,916
Come and get me, Father Protector.

75
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,541
Here.

76
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,458
Come on.

77
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,708
Alright, don't let me catch you.

78
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,750
I'm here.

79
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,625
Over here.

80
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,708
Little beauty.

81
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,125
Don't run.

82
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Got it.

83
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,208
Let's go.

84
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,541
Little beauty.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,916
Little beauty.

86
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,458
Come out.

87
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,333
We've fallen into a trap.

88
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,541
Guards!

89
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,125
Guards!

90
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,666
Stop!

91
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,625
Stop!

92
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,333
Don't run!

93
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,250
Don't run!

94
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,458
Stop!

95
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,583
Catch them!

96
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,791
Go find Li Jingnian first.

97
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,916
I'll distract them.

98
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,750
Don't worry, we'll meet outside the palace.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,833
Come and chase me!

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,125
I'm right here!

101
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,000
Stop!

102
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,375
Xiaoran!

103
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,666
Why are you here?

104
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,916
Eunuch Qiu isn't in the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

105
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,166
You're alone?

106
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,583
Where's Shen Qiuwan?

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,291
We managed to steal this.

108
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,708
Then that old man sent soldiers after us.

109
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,708
She led them away.

110
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,916
It's not safe to talk here, let's go.

111
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,583
Godfather.

112
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,916
Jingnian.

113
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,875
We've got the mirror.

114
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:24,750
Godfather.

115
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,125
This is the friend I've often mentioned to you.

116
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,083
Lin Xiaoran.

117
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,000
Your friend

118
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,375
is quite handsome.

119
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,000
His demeanor

120
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,916
is carefree and untroubled.

121
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,500
Everyone has their own troubles.

122
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,666
Now the land is torn asunder.

123
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,083
Everywhere is devastated.

124
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,958
Many people can't even get a meal.

125
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,875
It seems

126
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,333
Young Hero Lin

127
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,375
is also

128
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,916
someone who cares for the country and its people.

129
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,666
Prince,

130
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,708
I know you've devoted your life to the Tang Dynasty.

131
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,375
But now eunuchs still hold power.

132
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,416
Can't you do something about it?

133
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,625
If we overthrow them,

134
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,125
there will be another

135
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,958
storm of blood and violence.

136
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,333
The people

137
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,833
will still

138
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,166
suffer greatly.

139
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,791
Godfather.

140
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,666
Jingnian

141
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't hold on much longer.

142
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,000
From now on,

143
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,666
you'll have to rely on yourselves.

144
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,000
Remember,

145
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,166
if the court is not set right,

146
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,583
the land

147
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,333
the land

148
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,583
will be hard

149
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,833
to bring peace.

150
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,000
Father Protector

151
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,083
Father Protector

152
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,125
Father Protector

153
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,041
Xiao Liuzi

154
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,333
Xiao Liuzi

155
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,583
Sir

156
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,750
Xiao Liuzi was beaten and is barely alive.

157
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,833
He was thrown at the doorway.

158
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,083
Who is Xiao Liuzi?

159
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,791
Xiao Liuzi is Father Protector's

160
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,750
spy placed beside Eunuch Qiu.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,208
It seems Qiu De

162
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,083
is about to make a move.

163
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,916
Eunuch Qiu

164
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,125
What does this mean?

165
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,333
Li Jingnian tried to assassinate His Majesty

166
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,625
with intent to rebel.

167
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,916
The evidence is clear.

168
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,583
He deserves death for his crime.

169
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,083
You old traitor,

170
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,541
you want to wipe us all out.

171
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,958
Since you know everything,

172
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,083
I won't waste words with you.

173
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,416
When Prince Kang was alive,

174
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,208
I still had some concerns.

175
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,083
Now that he's dead,

176
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,875
it is heaven's will to destroy you.

177
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,041
Everything is arranged.

178
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,583
You came at the right time.

179
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,791
Leave no one alive.

180
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,708
Kill them all!

181
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,291
Take my boss and go first.

182
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,750
Luo Han!

183
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,333
Hurry, go!

184
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,500
Luo Han!

185
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,541
Go!

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,625
Luo Han!

187
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,916
Luo Han!

188
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,500
Kill him!
