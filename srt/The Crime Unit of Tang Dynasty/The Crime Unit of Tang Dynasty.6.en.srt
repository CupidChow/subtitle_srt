1
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,583
Back in the days in Chang'an,

2
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,416
there wasn't a single young lady who wasn't afraid of me.

3
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,875
No matter what,

4
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,708
you must come out before the candle goes out.

5
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,250
Do you understand?

6
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,500
My little beauty

7
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,625
Let me go

8
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,458
Brothel keeper, bring me ten more candles

9
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,708
Where is everyone?

10
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,250
Help!

11
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,916
Don’t you like to play?

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then let’s play together

13
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,458
I don’t want to anymore

14
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,041
Help!

15
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,166
The body is heavy and bloodless

16
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,333
The eyes are lifeless and vacant

17
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,375
Looks like his life force is drained

18
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,083
Although Xun Wan is the eldest son of the Imperial Secretary

19
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,833
He’s known for his lustful ways

20
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,000
Back in Chang’an

21
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,083
He was a regular at several brothels and taverns

22
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,166
The Imperial Secretary sent a letter asking me to investigate

23
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,666
Probably doesn’t want the scandal to spread

24
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,875
Boss, I’ve heard elders say

25
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,458
Excessive yang attracts lustful ghosts

26
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,166
The way he died

27
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,791
He was likely killed by a ghost courtesan

28
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,000
Ghost courtesan

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,666
Yes

30
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,541
The last place Xun Wan was seen was Liuxiang Pavilion

31
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,500
It’s said Liuxiang Pavilion has an unwritten rule

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,166
It only opens at midnight

33
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,541
Legend says it’s connected to the underworld

34
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,041
Even ghost courtesans come out to serve guests

35
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,750
Boss, it took me a lot of effort to find that place

36
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,083
Time is tight

37
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,250
Go back to Chang’an and report first

38
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,458
I’ll follow soon

39
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,750
Remember, don’t spread word of this case

40
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,958
Yes, boss

41
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,125
Where’s Lin Xiaoran?

42
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,541
What, are you afraid he’ll run away?

43
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,958
Lin Xiaoran, you still owe me payment

44
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,708
I’m so poor, all I have left is my good looks

45
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,875
Give me a little more time

46
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,208
Lin Xiaoran

47
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,708
You dare attack a court official?

48
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,333
Lord Li

49
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,208
It was this heroine who did it

50
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,125
You

51
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,416
May I ask your name, heroine?

52
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,500
I am Shen Qiuwan

53
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,958
He told me to do it

54
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,666
He owes me money and won’t pay

55
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,666
Lin Xiaoran

56
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,916
I think you have a talent for solving cases

57
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,250
Why not join me in the Cold Case Bureau?

58
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,541
I’ll help pay your debt

59
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,916
I don’t want to pay

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,583
You

61
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,750
That’s not up to you

62
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,958
Alright, alright, alright

63
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,333
Great, I found someone to help pay my debt

64
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,208
Perfect, I’ll join the Cold Case Bureau

65
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,333
With you here, he can’t escape

66
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,833
At the hour of Zi, the gates to the underworld open

67
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,833
Honored guests

68
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,750
Tonight’s auction will begin soon

69
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,291
As always, highest bidder wins

70
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,750
Wow, so beautiful

71
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,041
Really nice, look

72
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:53,916
Good

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,166
Shen Qiuwan

74
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,583
You keep watch here

75
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,041
I’ll go upstairs to look for clues

76
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:58,791
Hey

77
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,166
The bill isn’t settled yet, Lord Li

78
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,208
You’re really stuck with Lin Xiaoran

79
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:04,916
Brothel keeper

80
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,041
Yes

81
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,291
Lead the way

82
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,666
Alright, this way please

83
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,541
Thanks

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,583
Wow, such a great dance

85
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,583
Good

86
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,416
Excellent

87
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,666
Miss Wannin is one of Liuxiang Pavilion’s most popular girls

88
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,250
Starting price is one thousand taels

89
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,125
Three thousand taels

90
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,208
Wow, Wannin

91
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,875
You were auctioned for three thousand taels of gold

92
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,416
Ten times higher than the other girls

93
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,291
Can they compare to me?

94
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,083
A bunch of worthless fools

95
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,583
What are you so proud of?

96
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,833
Everything you have was given by me

97
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,541
You’d better know your place

98
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,000
Go

99
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,166
Bring the guest over

100
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,166
On this guest register

101
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,333
Why isn’t Xun Wan’s name listed?

102
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,916
Lord Li

103
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:55,958
What's wrong?

104
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,875
Where is he?

105
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,791
Who?

106
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,458
Where's Lin Xiaoran?

107
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,833
I don't know.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,875
He said there are ghosts in Liuxiang Pavilion.

109
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,916
His Three Pure Bells rang.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,083
That didn't happen.

111
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,916
But take a good sniff.

112
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,125
Besides wine, lust, and money, what else is here?

113
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,583
What's going on?

114
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,666
This guest won Miss Wannin with a bid of three thousand taels.

115
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,583
So I sent Wannin to serve him.

116
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,416
But who could've expected this to happen?

117
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,291
Zhang Can from Luoyang Protectorate

118
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,125
Committed suicide two years ago out of guilt.

119
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,125
It seems those who come here for pleasure

120
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,916
are all ghosts who dare not seek joy in daylight.

121
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,958
If that's the case,

122
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,958
these two

123
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,000
don't seem like something humans did.

124
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,791
The girls all say there are ghosts in the building.

125
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,041
I didn't believe it.

126
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,000
But I didn't expect it to be true.

127
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,333
Li Jingnian from the Cold Case Bureau

128
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,708
From now on, Liuxiang Pavilion is sealed off.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,625
No one is allowed in or out.

130
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,666
Lord Li

131
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,875
What should we do next?

132
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,541
At the third quarter of the hour of Zi

133
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,833
Break the rules

134
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,625
Catch the evil ghost
