1
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,125
Killed himself.

2
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,750
Another black handprint.

3
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,333
What is the killer's motive?

4
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,416
It wasn't me.

5
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,250
I didn't kill him.

6
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,125
Now there are only three people left in the manor.

7
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,041
Old Manor Master.

8
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,375
He Yun.

9
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,833
And you.

10
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,875
Young Master Lian.

11
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,125
Who do you think will be next?

12
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,791
The Old Manor Master,

13
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,041
doesn't believe in ghosts.

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,708
He thinks you killed Gao Li and Teng Rong.

15
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:56,916
Me?

16
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,916
Even if you're not a ghost,

17
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,875
could you become a restless spirit?

18
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:18,916
Back then,

19
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,041
we actually had a junior disciple.

20
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,458
His name was Bai Hua.

21
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,583
He was the most gifted among us.

22
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,083
He was even expected to surpass our master.

23
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,166
Good.

24
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,833
Excellent poem, truly.

25
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,833
What a pity.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,833
He was too eager for quick success.

27
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,541
He cheated in the imperial exams.

28
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,416
The examiner caught him on the spot.

29
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,083
This incident nearly ruined the reputation

30
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,791
of our Gu Ming Manor.

31
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,125
Our master

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,583
cares most about the manor's reputation.

33
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:04,458
He used the harshest punishment in the sect.

34
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,041
Breaking the brush and stabbing the thigh.

35
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,791
But Bai Hua was proud and stubborn.

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,625
He took poison out of shame and killed himself.

37
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,916
Since then,

38
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,125
we never spoke of him again.

39
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,166
We stopped mentioning him.

40
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,041
You've been emphasizing Bai Hua.

41
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,750
Are you saying Bai Hua is connected to that corpse?

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,750
Or is that corpse Bai Hua?

43
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,333
I've said all I needed to.

44
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,041
Madam is still injured.

45
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,625
If there's nothing else,

46
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,166
I'll head back now.

47
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,250
Young Master Lian.

48
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,041
What if Bai Hua didn't actually kill himself?

49
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,208
Don't you want to catch that ghost with me?

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,708
Ouyang Manor Master.

51
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,083
He's not here.

52
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,250
The Old Manor Master has such refined taste.

53
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,708
Enjoying a night stroll.

54
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,125
Young Hero Lin said he wants to catch a ghost.

55
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,875
Why come to Master's room?

56
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,250
Could it be

57
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,416
you suspect Master is the killer?

58
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,500
Did you have a grudge with Gao Li?

59
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,416
So the word "killer"

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,791
is basically written on your forehead.

61
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,666
You couldn't possibly be the killer.

62
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,125
Might as well investigate

63
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,708
this master who always stays out of things.

64
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,750
Maybe we'll find something unexpected.

65
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,833
You knew I would come.

66
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,416
Of course I knew.

67
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,916
Master cares for me the most.

68
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,291
Master.

69
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,083
You hurt me.

70
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,875
My dear.

71
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,333
Last time Master came to peek,

72
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,083
I knew too.

73
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,791
Oh.

74
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,083
Who?

75
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,083
My junior sister.

76
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,875
What do you think?

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,541
Look if you want.

78
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,000
Why play tricks to scare people?

79
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,833
That's what makes it fun.

80
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,541
Midnight rendezvous with a beauty.

81
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,458
Gently knocking on the moonlit door.

82
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,500
That's elegance.

83
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,250
And a beastly outburst?

84
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,750
That's elegance too.

85
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,458
Senior brother.

86
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,166
Beneath your refined appearance,

87
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,291
burns a fierce fire.

88
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,458
Hmm.

89
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,125
Then tonight,

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,583
I'll burn you up, little demon.

91
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,583
Madam.

92
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,333
What should we do?

93
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,333
Master.

94
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,208
What's wrong, Madam?

95
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,250
Husband, Teng Rong.

96
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,291
Teng Rong peeked at me bathing.

97
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,958
He peeked at you bathing?

98
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,875
Teng Rong, that scoundrel!

99
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,375
It seems Teng Rong got involved by accident.

100
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,791
He was discovered by Lian Songbai.

101
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,291
He took the blame for Gao Li.

102
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,458
The master was there that night too.

103
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,583
That's why the master was willing to help Gao Li cheat.

104
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,541
He lied, saying they were playing chess together.

105
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,833
You little troublemaker.

106
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,333
Since you know everything,

107
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,000
then everything that happened in the manor these past two days

108
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,333
was your doing, wasn't it?

109
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,416
You mean the murders?

110
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,416
I wouldn't dare do such a thing.

111
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,541
Oh.

112
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,625
The wind flickers the candle.

113
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,083
It seems there's more to this place than meets the eye.

114
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,375
Why is Bai Hua's work here?

115
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,833
I knew I was right.

116
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,958
What a cunning old manor master.

117
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,583
Such a noble, detached old manor master.

118
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,750
Young Master Lian.

119
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,291
Do you know why Bai Hua's body didn't decay for years?

120
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,458
It looked freshly dead.

121
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,208
Take a look.

122
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,875
Because he never died back then.

123
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,250
He was imprisoned here by your master to write on his behalf.

124
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,916
That earned Ouyang Ming his fame.

125
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,791
And brought glory to Gu Ming Manor.

126
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,958
Thank you, Young Hero Lin, for solving the mystery.

127
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,000
Young Master Lian.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Lian Songbai, let me out!

129
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,500
The killer is outside right now.

130
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,750
Lian Songbai!
