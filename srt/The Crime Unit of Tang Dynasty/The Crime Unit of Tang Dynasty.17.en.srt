1
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,250
Qiuwan

2
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,708
Shen Qiuwan, Qiuwan

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,541
It seems she was taken by the monster.

4
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,833
How could a monster abduct three people in an instant?

5
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,750
That depends on whether the Princess is truly human.

6
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,125
Old Man

7
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,166
Someone just tricked us into going east of the village.

8
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,708
Yes, and there was a monster there too.

9
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,208
They wanted us all dead there.

10
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,541
What is really going on?

11
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:48,791
Old Man

12
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,208
Are you alright?

13
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,083
The one who lured you out was probably Yu Ming.

14
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,541
Who is Yu Ming?

15
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,333
Why did he lead us into danger?

16
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,166
Three went out.

17
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,583
Two came back.

18
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,166
Did the woman get eaten by the tiger?

19
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,458
There were four of us, including your grandson Gouwa.

20
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,791
Gouwa

21
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,416
They might not be dead.

22
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,000
Old Man

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,708
We need to know the truth.

24
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,000
Yu Ming is also a member of the village.

25
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,583
Originally,

26
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,041
Guo Huai could keep him in check.

27
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:35,416
When the illness flared up, some lamb blood and meat would help.

28
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,458
What happened later?

29
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,708
The person you met in the cave was probably Guo Huai.

30
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,333
Their illness kept getting worse.

31
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,750
Yu Ming wanted Guo Huai to eat you.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,166
That way, they would have killed living people.

33
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,333
Once you enter the gates of hell,

34
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,750
there’s no turning back.

35
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
What kind of people are you?

36
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,125
Uncle, Uncle

37
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,625
Wake up.

38
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,250
Wake up.

39
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,125
Uncle, wake up.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Gouwa

41
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,416
Gouwa

42
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,708
You’re awake.

43
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,750
Uncle, play with me. I want to ride a horse.

44
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,958
Alright.

45
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,125
Hurry.

46
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,208
Stop!

47
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,416
He’s a human!

48
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,333
Is he still human like this?

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,416
Enough, leave it to me.

50
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,500
Let’s go.

51
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,875
Why did you run out here?

52
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:01,958
Let’s go.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,500
Why did you pretend to be a monster?

54
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,375
Because I don’t want to go back with you.

55
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,750
Everyone wants to rebel against their fate.

56
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,041
You know him?

57
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,833
He and I were childhood sweethearts.

58
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,125
Everyone thought he died at the border.

59
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,875
I thought so too.

60
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,458
But I always felt deep down

61
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,083
he was still waiting for me.

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,833
On this journey,

63
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,208
I prayed to the heavens to see him once more.

64
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,250
The heavens answered me.

65
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,333
General Guo didn't eat them.

66
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,250
They're still alive.

67
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,166
He ate them.

68
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,625
Guo Huai, General Guo.

69
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,875
He personally broke the commandment given to us.

70
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,416
He ate living people raw.

71
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,041
No.

72
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:19,833
No.

73
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,083
I clearly saw that woman with Gouwa just now.

74
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,500
Either die,

75
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,083
or live completely like a beast.

76
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,583
A life neither human nor ghost.

77
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,375
Haven't you had enough of this?

78
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,333
I find it very strange.

79
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,958
The person we just saw didn't look human at all.

80
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,375
The old man wouldn't let us kill him either.

81
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,458
So who exactly

82
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,916
is it?

83
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,583
Qiuwan.

84
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,333
Are you alright?

85
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm fine.

86
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,708
Good, as long as you're fine.

87
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,833
What about the princess?

88
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,291
The princess...

89
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:00,916
She's beyond saving.

90
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,583
Let's head back.

91
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,291
What do you mean, "beyond saving"?

92
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,500
She's turned into a monster like the sand demon.

93
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,708
Are you still going to take her back to the Imperial Court like this?

94
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,375
You saw it with your own eyes.

95
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,666
In the cave.

96
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,916
Didn't you all see it yourselves?

97
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,833
Gouwa.

98
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,333
Grandpa.

99
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,416
Child, are you hurt?

100
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,125
Grandpa, Uncle said

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,958
it was Second Uncle who wanted to harm them.

102
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,500
We can't go on like this.

103
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,208
We must find the princess.

104
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,833
Li Jingnian, what do you mean?

105
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,416
Find her alive or dead.

106
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,583
We're just going back like this?

107
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,041
The Imperial Court won't let this go.

108
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,791
Then stay here and wait for death yourself.

109
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,208
Heroine, calm your anger. Heroine, calm your anger.

110
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,541
This boy is dead.

111
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,375
The Imperial Court won't spare us.

112
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,125
Nor will it spare them.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,916
It's Yu Ming.

114
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,666
I have to go back.

115
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,541
Yu Ming wants to eat people.

116
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,083
I must stop him.

117
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,708
Once you enter the gates of hell,

118
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,250
there’s no turning back for them.

119
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,291
But can you control yourself?

120
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,000
Your illness is worse than theirs.

121
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,708
Don’t worry.

122
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,208
With you here,

123
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,541
I won’t fall into the abyss.

124
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,458
Three years ago, war broke out suddenly.

125
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,375
The Imperial Court sent elite troops to garrison the border.

126
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,708
They were preparing to repel enemy attacks.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,125
The commander was named Guo Huai.

128
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,875
Yu Ming was the deputy commander.

129
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,833
Everyone was united and loyal.

130
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,208
But before we could fight the enemy,

131
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,041
What happened to you afterward?

132
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,458
After that,

133
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,375
everyone was struck by a strange illness.

134
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,000
Most died on the spot.

135
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,250
We reported it to the Imperial Court.

136
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,166
But the Court hunted us down.

137
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,666
Their illness worsened.

138
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,375
They could only struggle to survive here.

139
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,166
But now,

140
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,958
their illness is even more uncontrollable.

141
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,750
They can no longer suppress the urge to eat people.

142
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,875
Guo Huai uses military orders to restrain them.

143
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,375
He won’t let them

144
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,333
completely turn into monsters.

145
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,833
Actually,

146
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,333
Guo Huai met the Princess of Tang we’re searching for.

147
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,041
They are old acquaintances.

148
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,000
They’ve been together these days.

149
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,416
Gouwa.

150
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,291
Grandpa.

151
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,625
This child’s parents were refugees.

152
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,458
They starved to death at the border.

153
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,958
I adopted him.

154
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,375
The soldiers treat him as family.

155
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,333
You must take care of him for me.

156
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,250
Grandpa, I won’t leave.

157
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,041
Hurry.

158
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,458
I’m used to being with them.

159
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,958
They won’t harm me.

160
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:11,375
Grandpa.

161
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,750
I know you have a heavy responsibility.

162
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,041
As a soldier of Tang,

163
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,541
I will fight for the people of Tang until my last breath.

164
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,291
Go, go now!

165
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,000
Protect the child, go!

166
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,208
Go!

167
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,208
Grandpa, hurry!

168
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:33,708
Jiang Sansheng of the mess unit, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment, Vanguard Army of Tang, is here.

169
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,708
Let’s see who dares to act rashly.

170
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,541
Brothers, wake up!

171
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,333
Qiuwan.

172
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:49,666
What’s wrong?

173
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,791
Take the child and go first.

174
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,166
Remember, you must find the Princess.

175
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,500
Go.

176
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,958
Wake up!

177
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,083
Why did you two fools come back again?

178
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,541
How could we leave you behind?

179
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,333
If we left you,

180
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,791
our hero would never sleep peacefully again.
