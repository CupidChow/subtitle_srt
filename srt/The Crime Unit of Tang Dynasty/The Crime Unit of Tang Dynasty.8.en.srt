1
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,208
Wan Ning, the top courtesan of Liuxiang Pavilion

2
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,333
Yunjin

3
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,708
A lowly female servant

4
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,041
You two

5
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,041
Confess truthfully

6
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,125
If Your Honor truly can't figure it out

7
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,083
Perhaps recall carefully

8
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,666
What happened when you burst into the room that day

9
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,458
This guest bid three thousand taels for Wan Ning

10
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,375
So I had Wan Ning serve him

11
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,208
But who could have expected this

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,291
The corpse in the room was just a diversion tactic

13
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,458
It was meant to draw our attention

14
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,375
Things were chaotic then

15
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,916
There was one more servant girl

16
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,500
No one would notice at all

17
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,625
After that

18
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,541
You two took turns pretending to be Yunjin

19
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,375
When one was Yunjin

20
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,958
The other became the murderous female ghost

21
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,541
I can't figure out your relationship

22
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,708
Why did you do this

23
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,041
And where did the corpse come from

24
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,958
We are real sisters

25
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,666
A lot of silver

26
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,166
Made all the ladies jealous and ruthless

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,916
If I didn't strike first

28
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,416
Should I wait for them to kill me first

29
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,458
Chunxiang, Qiulan, Xiahe

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,916
They all wanted to harm my sister

31
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,375
Fighting for her position

32
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,333
We saw through their evil intentions long ago

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,291
So we struck first to gain advantage

34
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,416
Hurry up

35
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,541
So you killed Xun Wan too

36
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,000
Xun Wan

37
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,166
He deserved to die

38
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,166
I'll step out for some air

39
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,458
Your Honor Li, what's wrong

40
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,666
Wan Ning and Yunjin are both weak women

41
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,833
If they really killed someone on the spot

42
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,416
They couldn't keep up the disguise anymore

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,250
That's right

44
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,666
Your Honor Li, do you still have doubts

45
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,833
Your Honor Li

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,166
Your Honor Li, we've found them

47
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,541
Chunxiang and Qiulan are still alive

48
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,791
Oh, my poor daughter

49
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,541
Those two wretches hid her in the woodshed

50
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,708
She almost died

51
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,166
She's alive

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,208
Then who are those two corpses

53
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,791
Probably girls who were killed before

54
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,916
The madam surely knows better than us

55
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,791
Why did Yunjin become like that before

56
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,375
She ran into your room

57
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,791
That wretch was ugly

58
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,666
She could never match Wan Ning's beauty

59
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,833
So she had wicked thoughts

60
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,208
I secretly kept some fine cosmetics and jewelry

61
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,625
They're worth a lot of silver

62
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,791
I only let the most favored girls use them

63
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,083
She must have tried to steal them

64
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,375
Enough, enough

65
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,208
At least we've caught the ghost

66
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,458
What do we do next

67
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,916
Take them back to the Cold Case Bureau

68
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,500
Continue questioning for details

69
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,375
As for you

70
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,708
You're coming with me too

71
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,000
My Sanqing bell is missing

72
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,083
Lin Xiaoran, don't play any tricks

73
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,125
What tricks would I play

74
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,833
My Sanqing bell is my livelihood

75
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,833
I must've left it at Liuxiang Pavilion

76
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,541
Don't let the madam hide it from me

77
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,416
You even lose your con artist tools

78
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,458
Your Honor Li, I'll go back with him

79
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,541
He helps you solve the case

80
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,625
You help him pay me back

81
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,583
So don't worry

82
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,791
I'll keep an eye on him for you

83
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,833
You two behave yourselves

84
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,333
What kind of people do you think they are

85
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,916
Help me, help me

86
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,333
How can I help you

87
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,000
Kill me, kill me

88
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,250
A group of miserable people

89
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,791
Looks like we're still too late

90
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,708
Why hide it from Li Jingnian

91
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,708
That guy's a stubborn fool

92
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,958
He only sees right and wrong, not human nature

93
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,125
Are you alright

94
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,583
What happened

95
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,416
Ghost

96
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,958
Ghost courtesan

97
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,208
Let's go

98
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,166
Trying to kill us.

99
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,833
You women exist just to entertain men like me.

100
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,875
I faked my death to lay low.

101
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,333
Paid a fortune to come here.

102
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,958
Didn't expect to meet a shady ghost courtesan like me.

103
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,000
Tonight, I'll see what a ghost courtesan is like.

104
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,833
Let's do this together.

105
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,708
Stop!

106
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,000
If you don't want to die again, get out now!

107
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,291
You're the one looking for trouble.

108
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,458
Are you alright?

109
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,958
Why aren't you leaving?

110
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,458
What do you think?

111
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,708
So you suspected this case wasn't simple all along.

112
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,208
Didn't you notice the madam wasn't surprised by the bodies?

113
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,666
And those courtesans too.

114
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,375
They're all lying nonstop.

115
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,333
Blaming each other.

116
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,833
Deliberately disrupting our investigation.

117
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,000
I remember you told me,

118
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,916
you saw Chunxiang and Qiulan hiding scars on their necks.

119
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,125
So there’s more than one female ghost in Liuxiang Pavilion.

120
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,208
I suspect all of them are.

121
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,583
Lin Xiaoran.

122
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,458
I've already given you all my cosmetics.

123
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,333
Please let me go.

124
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,291
I never wanted to hurt you.

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,333
You say you didn't want to hurt us?

126
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,125
Wretch, get out of my way!

127
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,791
Let me tell you,

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm not the real owner of Liuxiang Pavilion.

129
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,708
You can't afford to cross the one behind me.

130
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,250
Where's the antidote? The real antidote?

131
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,375
Antidote?

132
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,083
You don't really think the gu poison I gave you

133
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,625
actually has an antidote, do you?

134
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,583
Get out! All of you, get out!

135
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
Move! Leave!

136
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,125
Sister!

137
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,125
Sister!

138
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:18,041
We almost managed to escape.

139
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,958
Just a little more...

140
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,041
Luoyang Captain Wang Bin.

141
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,291
Executed for corruption a year ago.

142
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,333
Didn't expect to see him here too.

143
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,291
His death looks just like Xun Wan's.

144
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,666
He was likely trapped in a deep hallucination.

145
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,291
Looks like you were right.

146
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,583
All the guests here are shady types.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
And they're all closely tied to the madam.

148
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,333
What do you all know?

149
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,500
Don't hide anything from me.

150
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,375
The Sanqing Bell wouldn't ring for no reason.

151
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,375
The gu insects inside are especially sensitive to their own kind.

152
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,541
What does this have to do with gu insects?

153
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,333
Hey, where are you going?

154
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,583
To talk to the madam.

155
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,083
She's not breathing.

156
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,625
Where is she?

157
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,666
It can't be this fast.

158
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,458
Look for clues.

159
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,083
There's a door here.
