00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,955
THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,561
Oh my!

3
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,520
There we are.

4
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,356
Come out.

5
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,777
Come out before I make you.

6
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,864
Ten.

7
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,115
Nine.

8
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,368
-Eight.
-Oh, gosh.

9
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,246
Holy moly.

10
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,708
I was so focused on cleaning
the floor that I forgot where I was.

11
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,211
By the way, is all that hair
on the floor yours?

12
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,298
You need to be careful
or you might start balding.

13
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,719
No worries. I'm planning on pulling out
my brother's hair for transplants.

14
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,222
Hey, I can also hear you breathing
through your nose, Ms. Lee.

15
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,683
What you just said

16
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,227
is a clear insult against
the 30 million Koreans with rhinitis--

17
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,229
So sue me.

18
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,106
What are you doing?

19
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,108
Did you watch a spy movie?
What is this, an ambush?

20
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,777
How is it possible that you two

21
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,612
are getting more and more childish?

22
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,572
We were just curious, that's all.

23
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,990
Did you make up with Ward B?

24
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,202
If you did, then how?

25
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,745
Was there anywhere…

26
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,623
Anyway.

27
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,583
What did you expect
from a stakeout like this?

28
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,795
Did you think I'd stand here
and deliver a monologue?

29
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,673
Most rom-com leads do that.

30
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,884
Enough already! I'm going to burn
every copy of those dramas…

31
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,098
No, never mind.

32
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,224
I'll let it go.

33
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,352
I'm in too much
of a good mood to get angry.

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,772
So just get out of my sight,
if you please.

35
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,399
Why?

36
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,776
What put you in such a good mood?

37
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,737
She was smiling to herself
while looking out the window just now.

38
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,906
There's nothing there.

39
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,829
Jesus…

40
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,997
Oh, Buddha…

41
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,924
Oh, for heaven's sake! Move!

42
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,225
What in the world? Are you serious?

43
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,018
Even if you guys like each other,

44
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,396
you shouldn't be peeking like that!

45
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,398
I know I'm always talking about
risqué things,

46
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,108
but this isn't the way, friend.

47
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,985
No, that's not it. I just…

48
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,112
Just a moment ago, he wasn't…

49
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,490
Why does he walk so fast?

50
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,585
SOFTIE SWEETIE

51
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,961
-Is it him?
-Hey.

52
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,631
Wait. No, hold on.
Can you guys talk to him?

53
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,383
Tell him it was an accident!

54
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,094
What are they called? Oh, right, herons!

55
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,513
Tell him we were watching
a flock of herons pass by.

56
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,223
-Come on!
-Right.

57
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,892
Hey! Where are you going?

58
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,770
God damn it, those demons.

59
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,856
Damn it.

60
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,110
Hi, Baek-ho.

61
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,321
What happened just now
was a misunderstanding.

62
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,324
I wasn't trying to see
you shirtless or anything.

63
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,327
Okay, so I did see a tiny bit,

64
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,370
but it wasn't on purpose at all!

65
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,622
-I--
-It's all right.

66
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,956
At any rate,

67
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,209
you'll see it soon enough, anyway.

68
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,881
What--

69
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,133
Wait.

70
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,427
What?

71
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,473
Sleep well.

72
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,933
Wait, just hold on.

73
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:09,976
Did you say…

74
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,936
soon enough?

75
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,690
Not "later" or "someday,"
but "soon enough"?

76
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,990
Why?

77
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,245
Why did he say, "soon enough"? Why?

78
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,463
I think I've been bitten
by something lethal.

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,882
How could you say something like that…

80
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,263
and expect me to sleep? So Baek-ho!

81
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,764
Oh my gosh!

82
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,144
What do I do?

83
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:18,503
EPISODE 8
LETHAL

84
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,088
Let's have a toast.

85
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,091
-Drink up!
-Drink up!

86
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,928
Oh my gosh, this is so good.

87
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,055
-What is this? Why is this so good?
-It's so good.

88
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,307
-It's amazing.
-Let's take a selfie.

89
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,766
-A selfie?
-One, two, three.

90
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,685
Marry me!

91
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,395
-Is he proposing?
-Someone's proposing.

92
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,396
Oh, wow.

93
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,899
-Say yes. Say yes.
-Say yes. Say yes.

94
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,859
-Oh my gosh, I hope she says yes.
-Say yes!

95
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,361
-She said yes!
-She said yes!

96
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,662
-That was wonderful!
-Congratulations!

97
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,623
I'll be right back.

98
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,176
A vodka, please. Neat.

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,127
Should we just get married?

101
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,713
Excuse me?

102
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,966
Let's get married. You and me.

103
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,032
Here you are.

104
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,119
Well.

105
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,871
Love it! It's great!

106
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,082
Gracias.

107
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,088
Hey, what's going on?

108
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,453
Kim Mi-kyung. So Baek-ho.

109
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,090
Kim Mi-kyung, So Baek…

110
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,013
For heaven's sake.

111
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,610
Why did you style your hair?
We're just eating braised monkfish.

112
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,111
Do you think you'll get noticed?

113
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,405
Do you think you're famous or something?

114
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,366
The owner
is a huge stickler for punctuality.

115
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,452
Because of you, the bean sprouts

116
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,621
are losing their freshness in real time.

117
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,664
Okay, okay.

118
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,708
I apologize for looking fresh.

119
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,543
-Don't talk back to me.
-Put your shoes on.

120
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,271
What is it?

121
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,315
Why are you making that face?

122
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,996
You little--

123
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,459
Why? What's going on?

124
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,420
Come here! Dog Mi-kyung, you traitor!

125
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,215
How could you freaking do this to me?

126
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,301
You promised me first!
You should go with me!

127
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,595
I'm your bestie, your wifey!
So Baek-ho's just a mistress!

128
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,639
You freaking jerk!

129
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,474
What is going on right now?

130
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,309
Just wait until she stops.

131
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,228
She'll wear herself out.

132
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,364
Damn!

133
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,325
Good grief!

134
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,535
Freaking…

135
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,787
Oh, good! Kim, come here.

136
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,498
What's it called, a master key?
Get that for me.

137
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,084
No, we'll just break it down.

138
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,919
Bring the sledgehammer.

139
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,132
You owe me big time!

140
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,010
What are you doing?

141
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,178
-Gosh.
-Hey!

142
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,929
You can't freaking do this to me!

143
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,764
Put me down, you idiot!

144
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,766
Dog Mi-kyung, Dog Hwan-kyung!

145
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,477
You're both freaking dead!

146
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,438
You! Put me down! Whoa!

147
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:38,781
Are they gone?

148
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:40,909
Yes.

149
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,413
Did you have a previous engagement?

150
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,539
Gosh.

151
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,417
That's too big of a word for it.

152
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,004
We did make reservations
to eat a large braised monkfish.

153
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,714
You should've told me.

154
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,507
But it's our first time.

155
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,094
It's the first time you've offered
to make something for me.

156
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,512
And it's our first date at home.

157
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,598
This counts as a date, right?

158
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,476
-Yes, it does.
-Okay.

159
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,980
It's not the first time you've seen me
with unwashed hair,

160
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,440
so please bear with me.

161
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,692
So,

162
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,778
what delicacy do you have planned?

163
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,906
Do you like tofu salad?

164
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,204
I'll add in chicken breast.

165
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,001
How much do you have?

166
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,878
Well…

167
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,049
I'm not sure. Hee-jin bought it.

168
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,844
But I'll put in this and that
and some other stuff…

169
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,847
Then throw in everything you have.

170
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,807
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,024
Gosh.

172
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,625
You're really not going to talk all day?

173
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,252
When we get there,

174
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,255
you're not going to happily shout,
"It's so good, so spicy!"

175
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,381
and get all giddy?

176
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,094
Fine.

177
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,763
Let's go back, rip down the door,
and bring Mi-kyung with us.

178
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,057
No! We're already running late.

179
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,600
It won't be good if it's cold.

180
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,769
Then what should we do?

181
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,897
I don't want to see you upset, Honeybun.

182
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,607
You're so adorable when you smile.

183
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,530
I'm not just upset.

184
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,824
I'm feeling bereft of human relationships.

185
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,367
Did I ever stop her

186
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,870
from hanging out with So Baek-ho?

187
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,331
I'm saying there's an order to everything!

188
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,043
Dog Mi-kyung doesn't know jack
about the beauty of friendship.

189
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,920
But are you in a position to say that
about my sister, Honeybun?

190
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,215
Who's the one getting it on
with her best friend's brother

191
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,593
and keeping her mouth shut?

192
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,721
Come on, that's--

193
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,976
I told you not to try
to win an argument with me.

194
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,853
I'm pretty ticked off right now.

195
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,273
-Want a kiss?
-No!

196
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,109
I won't fall
for your physical temptations…

197
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,992
Pull over up there.
Just three kisses and we'll go.

198
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,808
What?

199
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,060
What is that?

200
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,187
What's a car like that
doing in Youngeul-ri?

201
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,107
That license plate is giving off
rude vibes for some reason…

202
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,281
Hey.

203
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,950
-You should get out.
-Right now?

204
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,535
Come on, get out!

205
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,036
Why? What's going on?

206
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,374
Ong-ju!

207
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,458
What are you doing?

208
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,377
What?

209
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,003
Lee Ong-ju!

210
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,382
Lee Ong-ju!

211
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:25,925
Oh, man.

212
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,972
You.

213
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,932
So you do value your life?

214
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,934
I thought you came here
because you didn't!

215
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,937
What do you think you're freaking doing?

216
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,816
-Who taught you to drive like that?
-Who freaking taught you to live that way?

217
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,735
You sold off your loyalty,
conscience, and shame

218
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,695
by becoming a mooch
for your wife's rich family!

219
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,864
How dare you try to school me?

220
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,033
Are you a professor
of Introduction to Leeching?

221
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,581
-Is Mi-kyung inside?
-Hey.

222
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,042
Get her name out of your dirty mouth.

223
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,836
Her parents named her that
so she could live a beautiful life.

224
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,464
How dare you use it, you bastard?
You're lower than dog crap!

225
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,382
Watch your language.
You're not some immature--

226
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,467
Hey.

227
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,219
You should be grateful
I'm letting you live.

228
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,472
If I could, I'd break every single one
of your ribs and use them as toothpicks.

229
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,391
But I won't. I don't want Mi-kyung
to suffer while I'm in prison.

230
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,852
-I'll kill you, you filthy bastard!
-Whoa, Ong-ju! Ong-ju!

231
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,940
Whoa! Come on, breathe. Calm down.

232
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,859
Why are you here?

233
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,486
Never mind.

234
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,113
Please leave.
You're not welcome here.

235
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,365
Can you butt out, please?

236
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,201
You don't know anything
about what's going on here!

237
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,661
Then what do you know?

238
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,080
If you knew even a smidgen
of what she went through

239
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,414
after you dumped her,

240
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,583
if you even took a second
to think about it,

241
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,753
you wouldn't dare show
your face like this!

242
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,171
Lee Ong-ju!

243
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,633
Let's be real.
You have no right to say that to me!

244
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,594
You had a part in Mi-kyung and me
breaking up like…

245
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,729
-Hwan-kyung.
-Yeah?

246
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,440
Promise me.

247
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,859
That you'll send balanced meals

248
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,736
in my prison care packages.

249
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,947
What? Ong-ju?

250
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,416
Get the frick over here!

251
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,043
-You jerk!
-Oh, for goodness' sake!

252
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,004
Are you insane? What are you doing?

253
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,381
Hades, Lord of the Underworld!

254
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,174
Today, I'm sending you a soul!

255
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,968
I pray that you will let him burn

256
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,220
for all eternity
in the pits of eternal fire!

257
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,598
Ong-ju, please calm down! Please!

258
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,017
If possible, I would like

259
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,020
to have him quartered once a day

260
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
by a four-headed dog,

261
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,150
with each head holding
a limb in its mouth!

262
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,780
-Sorry for the wait.
-No problem.

263
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,168
Damn it. You!

264
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,544
Get the frick over here.

265
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,632
I'm going to pull out all your hair,
make voodoo dolls,

266
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,051
and place them in shrines
all over the damn country!

267
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,093
Oh, there you are!

268
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,095
Hey, over here!

269
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:02,975
Damn it.

270
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,443
-Ki--
-Ki-se?

271
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,713
God damn.

272
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm so angry that it's driving me crazy.

273
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,303
This is why I said
we should buy a crossbow!

274
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,971
If you two hadn't stopped me,

275
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,016
I could've prevented that bastard
from strutting through Pyeongwon.

276
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,810
Oh, I'm so pissed!

277
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,855
Are they super close?

278
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,357
They're not just coworkers?

279
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,485
I don't know.

280
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,738
But he's not the type
to be friendly with just anyone.

281
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,575
It doesn't seem like
they're just coworkers.

282
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,537
So what if they're close?

283
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,414
Just storm in there like he did

284
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,499
and tell him everything
Park Ki-se has done!

285
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,419
Tell him he's the worst bastard ever
and that he should cut him off now!

286
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,087
She can't!

287
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,923
Don't you dare tell him.

288
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,634
Think about it.

289
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,802
If it were you,

290
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,762
do you think you could just date someone

291
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,515
who used to be engaged to your friend
but is now her sworn enemy?

292
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,810
You two just started dating.

293
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,437
This is your honeymoon phase!

294
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,272
Why drag the past into it?

295
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,773
If that bastard runs his mouth,

296
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,984
he'll end up knowing anyway.

297
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,819
It's better for you to come clean first

298
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,904
than to wait anxiously.

299
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,657
He's not going to tell him. How can he?

300
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,535
He's the one who mucked it up,
no matter how you slice it.

301
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,913
And Ki-se's not an idiot. There's no way
he'll blab about it first.

302
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,000
Why are you still nice to him?

303
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,503
Don't you know
what kind of a douche he is?

304
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,882
Just freaking thinking about what happened
makes my damn blood boil.

305
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,008
Guys.

306
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,763
You can stop now.

307
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,850
Stop bringing that up.

308
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,769
Please.

309
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,192
Mi-kyung…

310
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,405
Damn it.

311
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,741
How dare that Park bastard
freaking show up like that?

312
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,327
Damn him!

313
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,121
That son of a…

314
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,230
What is this?

315
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,274
Why does it say Park Ki-se on this?

316
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,915
Just so you know,

317
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,543
that was a slight altercation
with the driver who was behind me.

318
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,586
That's all it was.
There's nothing else to it.

319
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,547
Have a seat.
Would you like something to drink?

320
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,589
No, thanks.

321
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,883
Did I interrupt something?

322
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,511
I would have to say yes.

323
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,347
I didn't think you'd come
all the way here on a weekend morning.

324
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,767
Why does that sound like, "Do you
not have anything better to do?"

325
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,602
I was implying that I'm uncomfortable.

326
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,274
Ki-se.

327
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:39,984
Let me ask you directly.

328
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,070
Have you been acting strangely
towards me lately…

329
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,781
because of Hee-jin?

330
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,032
What?

331
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,368
Oh, yeah, that's right. It's Hee-jin.

332
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,704
How could you not say anything to me

333
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,581
when you had Hee-jin here the whole time?

334
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,749
You knew I was looking for her everywhere.

335
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,377
What happened is between you two.

336
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,879
I'm just Hee-jin's friend.

337
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,882
I can't be in the middle
and play messenger.

338
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,800
I hope you'll understand.

339
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,097
All right. We'll talk about that later.

340
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,060
Anyway, I guess it's true?

341
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,355
That you're seeing Ms. Kim?

342
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,984
Did you hear from Mr. Lee?

343
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,485
Is that important right now?

344
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,529
It seems like you've put a tail on me

345
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,698
and are getting reports
on everything happening at the lab.

346
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,827
It's not like that.
It's because I'm worried about you.

347
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,706
Wonhan's already chock-full of people
spreading rumors about you.

348
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,917
So how could you
cause a scandal like this?

349
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,045
I can't believe you're dating
a subordinate you're planning to fire.

350
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,882
Do you realize you're creating
your own Achilles heel?

351
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,093
This is going to follow you around
throughout your career!

352
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,765
I've considered every aspect.

353
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,850
And it doesn't matter anymore.
I'm serious about her.

354
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,312
-What?
-Thank you for worrying about me,

355
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,105
but I'd ask you not to go beyond that.

356
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,400
If you do, I think it would
definitely feel like interference.

357
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,404
How… how serious, exactly?

358
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,531
Are you…

359
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,326
You're really taking things
seriously with Ms. Kim?

360
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,119
You can't be talking about
marriage already.

361
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,245
Ki-se.

362
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,165
Can I give you a word of advice?

363
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,960
Pick up a hobby.

364
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,962
Something you can spend your energy on.

365
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,983
INCOMING CALL
SOFTIE SWEETIE

366
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,112
Man…

367
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,617
-Hello?
-I'm sorry, Mi-kyung.

368
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,869
That was a long wait.
I'll have the food ready soon.

369
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,872
Well…

370
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,667
Actually, it's fine. I have…

371
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,378
something urgent to review right now.

372
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,547
So I need to get this done first.

373
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,424
Then I'll bring the food to you.

374
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,134
No, it's all right.

375
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,511
What was it…
You know Oheung-ri?

376
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,431
The Crop Team at Oheung-ri also called,
so I have to head over there.

377
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,267
I don't think I can make it today.

378
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,436
Goodness, I'm so busy right now.

379
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,478
Oh, I see.

380
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,231
Don't tire yourself out too much.

381
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,484
Then what about later?
Maybe at dinner, I can…

382
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,518
Honeybun, are you still mad at me?

383
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,732
I was so mad that I ended up

384
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,734
raising my voice at you as well.

385
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,943
I'm very, very sorry.

386
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,115
I have an order. I'm busy.

387
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,368
Okay.

388
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,874
I mean, why did you have to nitpick
about something like that?

389
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,835
I may be lax about many things,
but manners are not one of them.

390
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,921
Why? As a 14-year-old in puberty,

391
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,256
I yelled at Mi-kyung once
and got beat up with a washcloth--

392
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,176
Gosh, how many times are you
going to bring that up?

393
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,844
-Let it go.
-How can I?

394
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,805
You helped her beat me up
with a shampoo bottle!

395
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,853
Back then, you were smaller than me.

396
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,732
When did you grow up to become
such a big cutie?

397
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,610
Don't treat me like a kid.
By the next year, I was taller than you.

398
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,948
Let's get it over with.

399
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,742
I bought a new brand of highballs
because I've heard they're good.

400
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,537
I can't wait to let my lips touch them

401
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,372
and feel them course down my throat.

402
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,167
Regarding what Ki-se said earlier…

403
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,211
What did he mean by that?

404
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,546
What?

405
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,216
When he said you had a hand
in their breakup.

406
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,635
I can't stop thinking about it.

407
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,557
It's all bullshit.

408
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,102
I was just…

409
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,603
always on Mi-kyung's side.

410
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,903
You know what?

411
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,614
Kiss time! Let's go!

412
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,616
Wait, be careful! This is going to spill!

413
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,499
I can't freaking believe it.

414
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,502
That jerk,
telling me I need to get a hobby.

415
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,296
I have a ton of things to do!

416
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,051
And it doesn't matter anymore.
I'm serious about her.

417
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,931
Is Mi-kyung serious about him, too?

418
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,729
Whoa.

419
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,244
Oh, no. Myungsu. Myungsu!

420
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,997
Oh, no. Oh, no, what do I do?

421
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,707
Oh, my goodness. What do I do?

422
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,252
Oh, my goodness. Myungsu.

423
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,503
Myungsu!

424
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,216
-Ah, ah.
-What?

425
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,843
To all Youngeul-ri residents.

426
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,803
This is an emergency announcement.

427
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,599
To all Youngeul-ri residents.

428
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,601
This is an emergency announcement.

429
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,396
Man.

430
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,531
Did you hear?
Myungsu ran away from home again.

431
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,743
What is wrong with him?

432
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,703
He needs to learn
how scary it is out there.

433
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,206
It's a phase, you know that.

434
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,832
I'll get the flashlight.

435
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,008
Oh, dear.

436
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,177
Goodness.

437
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,262
We'll find him soon.

438
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,888
She had dinner.

439
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,308
Yes, she found out then.

440
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,518
This is crazy.

441
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,644
Oh, gosh!

442
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,397
You're all here!

443
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,816
Of course! It's for Ms. Hong.

444
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,567
How long has he been gone?

445
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,071
Well, the specifics will be
given to us by Mr. Byun in a bit.

446
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,990
-Grab some water first.
-Okay.

447
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,033
-Thank you.
-Take a lot, okay?

448
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,750
Mi-kyung!

449
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,844
Wait, why is he…

450
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,179
What's happening right now?

451
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,180
Are you okay?

452
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,891
You look like the one who's not okay.

453
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,602
What is all this? Are you seeking asylum?

454
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,063
Oh, this?
This is my emergency survival kit.

455
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,482
I thought this was an emergency--

456
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,947
Did you not hear the announcement?

457
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,701
Ms. Hong's baby ran away from home,
so we're going to go find him.

458
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,286
Did you only hear "emergency"

459
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,371
and rushed to pack
before running out here?

460
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,750
Is he a genius or a dummy?

461
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,961
Come on. It just means
he's got great survival skills.

462
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:43,925
Come closer.

463
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:48,513
To all Youngeul-ri residents,
thank you so much

464
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,891
for gathering at such a late hour.

465
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,184
As I said before,

466
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,270
Ms. Hong's youngest
has run away from home.

467
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,064
To speed up the search,

468
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,232
I'll relay the information
about the missing kid.

469
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,110
Name, Hong Myungsu.

470
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,654
Born in January 2023.

471
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,574
What does this say?

472
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,117
Here.

473
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,954
How does a one-year-old
run away from home?

474
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,792
Weight, 150 kg.

475
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,336
On the slim side.

476
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,672
Myungsu is a calf.

477
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,508
-Did you not know?
-What?

478
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,927
Wait,

479
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,304
then the whole village is out here
because of an animal--

480
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,972
Be quiet.

481
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,766
Do you want them to close the road again?

482
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,562
He gets frightened easily

483
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,481
and is very wary of strangers.

484
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,982
Please call the village hall

485
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,734
the moment you find him

486
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,530
so that Myungsu can safely
come back home.

487
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,156
Thank you for your cooperation.

488
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,159
Yes! That was great, Mr. Byun!

489
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,286
-Hey!
-Come with me.

490
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,538
All right, let's go find him.

491
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,622
Myungsu!

492
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,624
Please search thoroughly.

493
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,876
-Myungsu!
-Myungsu!

494
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,420
Hurry up, let's go find him.

495
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,256
-Oh, my Myungsu.
-Where are you, Myungsu?

496
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,050
Since we've decided to search
near the house first,

497
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,386
-Ong-ju and I will go right--
-Oh, who are you?

498
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,596
You look awfully similar to my ex-spouse

499
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,099
who abandoned her wifey
for her mistress.

500
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,101
I knew you'd still be holding a grudge.

501
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,228
Fine, then it's me and Hwan-kyung.

502
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,105
You and I walking together
under the moonlight?

503
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,690
I don't know about that.

504
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,941
-Let's go.
-Okay.

505
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,235
Oh, those little…

506
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,740
Do you have a flashlight?

507
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
How many lumens?

508
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,333
Myungsu.

509
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,211
Myungsu.

510
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,797
-Myungsu.
-Myungsu.

511
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,301
Myungsu.

512
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,053
-Myungsu.
-Myungsu.

513
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,932
-Myungsu.
-Myungsu.

514
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,560
My goodness. Myungsu.

515
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,520
Myungsu.

516
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,983
-Where are you, Myungsu?
-Where could you be?

517
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,611
Myungsu.

518
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,866
Wow, there are so many stars.

519
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,409
Oh! You're right.

520
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,754
Hey! What the heck?

521
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,881
Be careful.

522
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,883
Oh, my goodness. What is this?

523
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,928
Did you get this from a baseball stadium?

524
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,347
This high-performance searchlight

525
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,725
can go up to 25,000 lumens
and go as far as 550 meters.

526
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,560
It's from overseas.

527
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,480
Why do you even have this?

528
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,857
Because it's useful
in multiple situations. For example,

529
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,568
I could signal my location
if I get lost in the mountains.

530
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,487
This isn't just a signal.

531
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,197
This is basically the sun.

532
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,033
You'll have everyone in Gangwon-do

533
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,451
up and ready for work with that.

534
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,411
Do you not have anything normal

535
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,996
that a normal person might use?

536
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,835
How can you be so thorough all the time?

537
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,798
Isn't it exhausting to prepare
for every single possibility?

538
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,132
It's an old habit.

539
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,553
I was my own guardian for a long time,

540
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,888
so I had to prepare myself for anything

541
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,265
so I wouldn't be afraid.

542
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,353
Even then, life isn't
any kinder to you.

543
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,565
Being alone so much
must have been scary for young Baek-ho.

544
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,025
For a bit. Not anymore.

545
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,027
Why? Because you're all grown now?

546
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,613
I realized

547
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,449
that sometimes, a variable I can't predict

548
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,201
or control…

549
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,662
could bring me joy.

550
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,957
Gosh.

551
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,670
So… about yesterday.

552
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,630
I know. You were avoiding me on purpose.

553
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,048
What?

554
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,091
How did you know?

555
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,844
You said you were going to Oheung-ri

556
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,888
but spent half the day napping
with the curtains wide open.

557
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,808
Wow.

558
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,604
Wow, dating my neighbor is so scary.

559
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,440
I can't deny anything or run away.

560
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,445
Aren't you…

561
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,614
going to ask why?

562
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,284
The Kim Mi-kyung I know

563
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,785
gets angry when she's angry

564
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,287
and makes it clear when she's upset.

565
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,623
But if it's neither of those,

566
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,417
it means there's a reason why
you don't want to tell me.

567
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,586
So I didn't ask.

568
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,382
And I'm not going to ask now.

569
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,265
Baek-ho.

570
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,226
To be honest, years ago…

571
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,353
Myungsu?

572
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,356
Oh! Myungsu!

573
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,609
Wait, Mi-kyung.
Mr. Byun said he scares easily.

574
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,362
So let's be quiet
and move as little as possible.

575
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,571
-Okay?
-Yes, of course.

576
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,615
I'll make the call first.

577
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,284
Myungsu.

578
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,037
You remember me, right?

579
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,164
When you hit 100 kilograms
and we threw a party,

580
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,166
I bought you straw, remember?

581
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,337
Hey!

582
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,589
No, wait, Baek-ho!

583
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,552
Hello? Mr. Byun?

584
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,805
Yes, the path on the left
of Mr. Yang's lettuce field.

585
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,390
He went up toward the mountain.

586
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,349
Yes!

587
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,458
Why did you run off after him like that?

588
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,210
What were you going to do alone?

589
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,587
There's a highway entrance
just 300 meters to the right.

590
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,132
It would be bad if he got on the highway,

591
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,300
so I decided to appease him
as quickly as I could.

592
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,721
Wow. You made a plan that fast?

593
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,349
He could've picked
a better place to run off to.

594
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,726
Did you call them?

595
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,271
Yes, but it'll take them time to get here
since we're in the mountains.

596
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,524
I hope he stays put until then.

597
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,615
Oh, man, I bet Hong Myungsu

598
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,909
was a meerkat in his past life.

599
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,536
He's so jumpy and alert.

600
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,749
-Mi-kyung.
-Yes?

601
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,293
Do you know why goats climb cliffs?

602
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,212
That's what you want to ask me right now?

603
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,090
Sodium is an essential mineral
in our daily lives,

604
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,801
but herbivores rarely have
the opportunity to ingest it.

605
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,013
That's right, since grass
and grains don't contain sodium.

606
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,098
That's the reason why goats climb cliffs,

607
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,224
risking their lives.

608
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,226
They're trying to find rock salt to lick.

609
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,145
Similarly, there are herds of elephants

610
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,980
that dig through
cave walls for salt water.

611
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,732
Right. I got your point.

612
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,151
Herbivores are obsessed
with getting their sodium intake.

613
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,861
But why is that important right now?

614
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,362
If that's the case…

615
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,241
wouldn't it apply to cows as well?

616
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,036
I mean, yes…

617
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,081
Wait.

618
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,212
No way.

619
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,515
MYUNG-SU'S HOUSE

620
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,599
Ms. Hong!

621
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,144
Oh my! Oh my goodness.

622
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,854
Myungsu.

623
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:35,855
Oh, Myungsu!

624
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,024
-Ms. Hong, it's Myungsu.
-Oh my goodness.

625
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,944
Myungsu! Myungsu, my dear.

626
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:45,990
My goodness, you silly thing.
Where did you go?

627
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,244
I really thought I lost you
for good this time.

628
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,205
He went all the way up
that mountain there,

629
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,625
but Seoul Guy here
lured him with some salt

630
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,544
and brought him back.

631
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,797
I never would've imagined
that you'd know such things.

632
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,590
Gosh.

633
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,887
It's amazing what you did,
and I can't thank you enough.

634
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,308
My goodness, my dear Myungsu.

635
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,394
Wait, what…

636
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,771
what is this supposed to be?

637
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:17,939
What is this black thing?

638
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,400
It's a mini tracking device
for professional use.

639
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,485
It sends coordinates every 3.7 seconds

640
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,153
-and the receiver speed--
-Well…

641
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,239
It's a location tracker, Ms. Hong.

642
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,949
If Myungsu runs away from home again,

643
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,493
his location will pop up on my phone.

644
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,996
We'll be able to find him
and bring him back.

645
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,128
How can I ever repay you?

646
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,254
Goodness me.

647
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,425
-My dear Myungsu.
-Yes, that's good.

648
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,927
Goodness me, thank you.

649
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,054
Oh my goodness.

650
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:51,973
Gosh.

651
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,311
At any rate, Mr. Seoul Guy,

652
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,605
you were a bit aggressive
at the beginning,

653
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:02,233
but now that I've gotten to known you,
you're the real deal.

654
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,153
If Chang-sook was just 20 years younger,

655
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,322
I would have set you up with her.

656
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,656
Gosh.

657
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,700
Oh, what a shame!

658
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,453
It's just too bad
that turning back time is impossible.

659
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,705
-That's true.
-You must be exhausted.

660
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,665
You should get home
and get some rest, Mr. Byun.

661
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,417
Sure. Take care.

662
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,336
Whew.

663
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,423
Who's Chang-sook?

664
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,091
It's his younger sister.

665
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,552
She recently got divorced again

666
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,180
and is now on the search
for her third or fourth husband.

667
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,308
If Mr. Byun says he'll buy you food,
do not go with him.

668
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,559
That's a blind date.

669
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,770
I'll go eat,

670
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,521
then say I like someone else and run out.

671
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,773
How's that?

672
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,274
Oh, shucks.

673
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,946
Is that what happened? My sweetie.

674
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,572
My little sweetie.

675
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,742
My dear Myungsu.

676
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,162
He's not just livestock to her, right?

677
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,288
You're right.

678
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,332
The truth is, Ms. Hong

679
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,168
was diagnosed
with stage 2 dementia last year.

680
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,880
There was a whole ruckus over whether
to place her in a senior care center

681
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,007
or have one of her kids take care of her.

682
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,260
But then one day, she suddenly
brought home a calf from the market.

683
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,390
She basically declared
that she doesn't want to lie in bed

684
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,643
waiting to die, but to keep living

685
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,269
as she always did, at her home.

686
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,814
Since then,

687
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,066
Myungsu has become like a son to her.

688
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,404
You need to change the batteries
about every 210 days.

689
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,989
Make sure to check it on time.

690
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,449
Okay. Seven months?

691
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,663
Man, I'm not sure.

692
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,040
I might be exhausted
from job hunting by then

693
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,960
and be roaming the East Sea
on a fishing boat.

694
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,922
Speaking of which,
I should go search for jobs.

695
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,382
Wait.

696
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,218
Mi-kyung, wait.

697
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,429
Come on, don't be like that.

698
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,851
Goodness me.

699
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,604
I knew these two would slip out
in the middle of everything.

700
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,690
Jeez.

701
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,739
Hey, you lazy bums!

702
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,949
I was roaming the mountain and fields,
sweating my butt off

703
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,411
in order to uphold
our guesthouse's honor--

704
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,496
Mi-kyung, wait!

705
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,498
Some owner you are!

706
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,996
Whoa.

707
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,582
No way.

708
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,835
No freaking way.

709
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,463
Ong-ju. Ong-ju.

710
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,548
This is one for the books!

711
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:13,841
Hey, it's on right now!

712
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,053
Hwan-kyung's brought a girl home!
Hurry up, get out here!

713
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,098
What in the world are you doing?

714
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,808
What?

715
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,769
Where did she dash off to now?
She needs to see this!

716
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,937
Wait a second.

717
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,071
What?

718
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,892
Where is it?

719
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,065
Where is it?

720
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,358
It's here. I found it.

721
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,155
Hey, Mi-kyung.

722
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,447
Right now, I'm…

723
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,340
You two…

724
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:38,718
Why…

725
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,184
Why are you two…

726
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,023
Why…

727
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,150
Are you two…

728
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,573
Are you okay?

729
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,371
Do you want some hot water?

730
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,580
Do you think I'm okay?

731
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,250
Is that even a question?

732
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,168
Is it?

733
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,051
Do you think I'm okay right now?

734
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,269
You two…

735
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,604
Wait. I can't even…

736
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,399
The two of you?

737
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,650
Am I dreaming?

738
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,527
How?

739
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,113
You're Kim Hwan-kyung.
You're Lee Ong-ju.

740
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,239
You two…

741
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,324
you're family.

742
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,869
Wait a second, isn't there a legal…

743
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,247
Is this right?

744
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,165
Is this allowed in civilized society?

745
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,917
Aren't you afraid of what people will say?

746
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:38,170
Just because we live together
doesn't mean we're actually family.

747
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,297
We aren't even related--

748
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,381
"We"?

749
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,300
"We"?

750
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,760
Did you just refer to yourselves

751
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,637
as "we" in front of me? "We"?

752
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,431
Don't yell at Ong-ju.

753
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,060
-It's not her fault. It was all--
-Why is it not her fault?

754
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,895
You.

755
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,647
I can't believe

756
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,150
that you actually did this!

757
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,151
It's okay for him!

758
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,403
We'll say he's a child
who can't tell right from wrong.

759
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,031
But you can! How could you?

760
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:08,367
Just because there aren't any men around
is not an excuse to get with Hwan-kyung!

761
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,119
Hey.

762
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,497
If you get hungry on the road,
do you pick up animal poop and eat it?

763
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,291
No!

764
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,917
We're intelligent adults.

765
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,586
But with him? How could you--

766
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,921
Hey! There's nothing wrong with him.

767
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,256
You may not know it,

768
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,051
but he's not a bad boyfriend.

769
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,802
Damn it! Stop talking!

770
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,850
This is disgusting. So disgusting.

771
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,479
So every time I wasn't here, you two…

772
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,942
I can't eat anything now.

773
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,904
I can't sleep.
I'm afraid of dreaming about you.

774
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,074
Oh, this is freaking gross!

775
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,830
I can't live here anymore.

776
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,415
What?

777
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,045
-Come on, Mi-kyung.
-No!

778
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,346
Hey, Mi-kyung!

779
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,184
Oh, man.

780
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,543
Can you give this to my sister?

781
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,169
Tell her it's some necessities.

782
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,629
Why are you giving this to me?

783
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,631
Is she not inside?

784
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:50,136
Her car's still here,
so I thought she came to you.

785
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,680
Hwan-kyung. Is something wrong?

786
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,147
Angry when you get bitten…

787
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,398
Wrong!

788
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,861
Angry when you get bitten. Keep going.

789
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,279
It seems like…

790
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,865
I have a knack for searching.

791
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,743
I found two runaways in one day.

792
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,829
Gosh.

793
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,038
You scared me.

794
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,252
How did you know I left?

795
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,422
Did Hwan-kyung tell on me?

796
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,175
Actually, he asked me to give this to you.

797
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:31,260
He said he packed
what you need for tomorrow,

798
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,429
like a blouse, laptop, your bag,
and other necessities

799
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,681
since we're going to Headquarters.

800
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,892
If he cares enough for me to do this,

801
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,810
he shouldn't have done that
behind my back.

802
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,812
Are you that upset?

803
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,648
This can't simply be described
as being upset.

804
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,067
I mean, think about it.

805
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:51,280
Hwan-kyung is my baby brother.
Ong-ju is like my twin sister.

806
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,908
The three of us
basically grew up together.

807
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,868
Since Hwan-kyung was a baby, we saw him

808
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,078
when he learned how to write,
got his first pimple,

809
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,248
got dumped by his first love
and bawled his eyes out.

810
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,125
Gosh.

811
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,710
So how could they like each other?

812
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,505
Siblings can't do that.

813
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,882
They need to be arrested.

814
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,008
I see.

815
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,346
They may be siblings and family to you,

816
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,641
but perhaps they didn't feel
that way toward each other.

817
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,060
I'm worried that it's not even that deep.

818
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,938
They open the bathroom door
while one of them is using it

819
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,065
to call for more toilet paper.

820
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,901
One time,
I saw them drinking beer together

821
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,694
and having a burping contest.

822
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,323
There was no room
for any feelings to grow.

823
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,912
Both of them are just lonely and bored,

824
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,083
and they just happen
to be around each other.

825
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,294
So they're playing with fire
to sate their hunger.

826
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,964
They're out of their minds.

827
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,720
Still, wouldn't it be better
if you let them explain?

828
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,598
Hwan-kyung looked like
he had a lot to say.

829
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,309
I don't want to hear this anymore.

830
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,395
Just thinking about it makes me furious.

831
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,814
I can't look at them.

832
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,774
I can't erase the image from my mind.

833
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,943
So you won't go home either?

834
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,904
How can I?

835
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,781
I don't want to see anything else.

836
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,575
You seem to be still in shock,

837
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,535
so take all the time
you need to calm down.

838
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,495
But…

839
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,873
I can't let you sleep here alone.

840
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,671
What do you mean?

841
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,882
That I'm joining you.
And running away from home.

842
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,262
Oh, gosh. Baek-ho.

843
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,890
Thank you for being such a softie sweetie.

844
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,601
I really am grateful.

845
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,687
But right now, I don't think
there's anything that would help--

846
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,105
I'm not being soft or sweet.

847
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,030
I'm making a move.

848
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,416
Do you not want me to?

849
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,340
Do you?

850
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,655
TRYING TO JUSTIFY THE FACT
THAT JUST 20 MINUTES AGO

851
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:41,200
SHE WAS CONDEMNING HER BEST FRIEND
AND BROTHER'S RELATIONSHIP AS LUST

852
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:45,829
BUT IS NOW AT A HOTEL
ENTICED BY HER SITUATIONSHIP

853
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,798
All right. Okay.

854
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,653
Damn it.

855
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,988
I should've bought some bras
when Ong-ju told me to.

856
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,865
Damn it.

857
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,704
It doesn't matter now.

858
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,432
How do you get the mood going again?

859
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,169
Here.

860
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,420
Oh, okay…

861
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,797
Should…

862
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,216
I…

863
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,094
wash… wash up?

864
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,971
If you'd like.

865
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,892
Right. Then…

866
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,603
I'll be off now.

867
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,399
What?

868
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:40,778
Wait a second.

869
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,323
You said we'll be runaways together.

870
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,700
Then aren't you also staying…

871
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,911
No?

872
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,162
Oh, I see.

873
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,539
That was to lure you.

874
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,583
Like how I used salt with the calf,

875
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,502
I used So Baek-ho with Kim Mi-kyung.

876
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,212
What?

877
00:54:58,879 --> 00:54:59,755
Why?

878
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,632
Why?

879
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,592
The rest area is hot, stuffy,
and uncomfortable,

880
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,427
but you insisted on not returning home.

881
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:09,181
But if I said I'd book you a hotel room,
you wouldn't have come so willingly.

882
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,557
Why are you--

883
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,185
why are you treating me like an animal?

884
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,940
I'm very emotionally vulnerable right now.

885
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,609
I'm not in the mood to play games
or have my heart toyed with.

886
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,195
Were you hoping for something--

887
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,947
I wasn't hoping…

888
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,826
Jeez.

889
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,371
Forget it. Just go.

890
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,456
If I throw another fit,

891
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,416
I think I might blow
a blood vessel somewhere.

892
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,710
Just go. Go.

893
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,306
Not tonight.

894
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,226
Because I know
you're emotionally vulnerable.

895
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,647
I'm sorry.

896
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,024
I wasn't trying to play games
or toy with your heart.

897
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,025
Okay?

898
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,495
Can I order room service?

899
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,747
Yes.

900
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,251
I'm going to order enough
for three people.

901
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,049
Are you going to pick me up
tomorrow morning?

902
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,468
Yes.

903
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,106
Try luring me again
like this next time, I'll--

904
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,650
You won't have time
to get angry next time.

905
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,372
Get some sleep.

906
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,999
Call me when you wake up. Okay?

907
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,251
Yeah…

908
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,086
okay.

909
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,298
I'll be going now.

910
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,318
He's so lethal.

911
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,697
He's such a pro at this. Oh my gosh.

912
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,509
INCOMING CALL
YOON HEE-JIN - MOBILE

913
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,017
Hello?

914
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,810
It's me, Hee-jin.

915
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,356
I was just thinking of you.

916
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,608
It's…

917
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,154
our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

918
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,492
Where are you right now?

919
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,623
This way.

920
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,877
-Hello, Mr. Park.
-Hello!

921
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,087
Where's Mr. Bu?

922
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,214
He went out to the self-irrigated fields.

923
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,800
May I ask who you're with?

924
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,303
Nice to meet you.

925
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,598
I'm Section Chief Lee Seung-hoon from
Wonhan Retail's Strategic Planning Dept.

926
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,016
Oh, I see.

927
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,226
Hello, I'm Lee Chung-hyeon.

928
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,895
I'm Kwon Hee-dong.

929
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,565
Hello. I'm Section Chief Ko Jung-hae.

930
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,318
-Thank you for all you do.
-Thank you.

931
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,402
Well…

932
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,574
I think right here should be good.

933
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,617
Oh, sure. Yes.

934
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,535
It seems nice. You have the A/C there.

935
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,662
Let's see…
Could you give me a hand here?

936
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,915
-Excuse me?
-We'll put Mr. Lee's desk here.

937
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:50,087
His desk? In our office?

938
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,973
OMG RIGHT NOW

939
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:07,229
Could I get a cup of coffee, please?

940
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,355
Black.

941
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,193
Me?

942
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,861
Is there…

943
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,197
anyone else here?

944
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,326
Oh!

945
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:27,082
My firm skin must have made you think
I was one of the younger employees.

946
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,001
I'm Section Chief Ko Jung-hae.

947
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,628
Section Chief Lee.

948
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,672
-Yes?
-Yes.

949
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,507
I am well aware.

950
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,386
Section Chief Ko Jung-hae.

951
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,973
He knows, yet he still…

952
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,734
Oh, you must not know
where the break room is.

953
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,572
Right. So here's
where we have our break room.

954
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,992
I don't have much time to spare
juggling work from Headquarters and here.

955
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,786
You wouldn't happen
to have an ice maker, would you?

956
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,913
Then I'll have a hot coffee.

957
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,084
-Oh, Director Kim.
-Wow.

958
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,336
Yes. How have you been?

959
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,464
Gosh, I'm actually in Pyeongwon right now.

960
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,800
Of course, I would love to help…

961
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,386
Ms. Ju, this way.

962
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,139
What's going on?

963
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,433
Why can't I go to the office?

964
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,270
Mr. Ko! What's wrong with you?

965
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,230
-He was ordered to make coffee.
-What?

966
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,316
Do you know anything, Ms. Ju?

967
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,818
About the Strategic Planning Dept.
Section Chief and why he's here.

968
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,445
We have another one?

969
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,446
Here? At Potato Lab?

970
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,698
He's even got a desk in our office.

971
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,783
The Production Dept. said
they had no space.

972
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,204
Gosh, he lied through his teeth.

973
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:51,416
Chief So downsized that whole team,
so all they have are empty desks.

974
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:54,044
They tossed him to us
because they're uncomfortable.

975
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:58,465
Damn Park, that traitor.

976
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,717
Wait, he didn't even say
what he's doing here

977
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,927
or how long he's staying?

978
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,678
He just arrived and settled in?

979
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:06,056
Yes, he barged in

980
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,808
and said, "Clean that up and make space."

981
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,771
Then he said, "Make a cup of coffee--"

982
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,398
It's all right. It's all good.

983
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:18,735
Can't you just tell him to go work
somewhere else, Mr. Bu?

984
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,070
You rank higher than he does.

985
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,780
Hey, Hee-dong.

986
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,199
Even Mr. Bu can't say anything to him.

987
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,158
Why not?

988
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,036
If you look at the organization chart,
the Strategic Planning Department

989
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,788
is right next to the Chairman's Office.

990
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:33,041
And Potato Lab is two levels under R&D,

991
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,251
which is under F&B,

992
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,712
which is under Food.
We're shoved in a corner.

993
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,881
You didn't have to point that out--

994
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,591
That's why I don't get this at all.

995
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,761
Is there a crude oil deposit
hidden underneath our lab?

996
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,014
Why are they coming here and meddling?

997
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,724
Mr. Bu. What did Chief So say?

998
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,686
He went to Headquarters
with Ms. Kim today.

999
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,315
At any rate, be careful of what you say

1000
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,526
in the office, all right?

1001
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,821
I'll look into how this happened.

1002
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:15,583
What?

1003
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,168
What does this mean?

1004
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,921
They're saying someone
from the Strategic Planning Dept.

1005
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:21,631
has taken a desk
in the Research Team's office.

1006
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,883
Oh, that. Well…

1007
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,013
Headquarters sent someone
to help me with my work.

1008
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,431
I'll be sending him back soon.

1009
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,934
Wonhan sure does work strangely.

1010
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,561
Like that Park Ki-se…

1011
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,273
I mean, Executive Director Park.

1012
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,650
What are you all coming to Pyeongwon for?

1013
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,361
Your department must not be too busy.

1014
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,447
But I bet your pay is super high.

1015
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:51,286
Man, I would've given him a super
uncomfortable welcome if I were there.

1016
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,435
Let's go.

1017
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,315
Let's go outside and talk.

1018
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:24,652
Okay.

1019
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,667
Give me a hug.

1020
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,590
Hug me.

1021
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,550
Right now.

1022
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,928
What are you playing at--

1023
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,440
Hee-jin?

1024
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,226
WEDDING INVITATION
GROOM PARK KI-SE, BRIDE YOON HEE-JIN

1025
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,467
-Come in, come in.
-Yes.

1026
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,595
The weather's wonderful today.

1027
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,763
This place is beautiful.

1028
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,808
You don't have to buy me a meal.

1029
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,560
I wasn't much help at all.

1030
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,187
No, don't say that.

1031
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,981
Knowing how much
you contributed to Youngeul-ri,

1032
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,358
I should've treated you
a dozen times over already.

1033
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,320
Here we are.

1034
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,614
-Go on in.
-Oh, okay.

1035
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:41,831
Who is…

1036
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,250
Oh, this is…

1037
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,754
the most beautiful woman
Youngeul-ri produced.

1038
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,130
Byun Chang-sook.

1039
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,384
Hello, I'm Byun Chang-sook.

1040
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,638
And this is the person I told you about.

1041
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,056
Mr. Kim Hwan-kyung.

1042
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,100
Oh, right.

1043
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,811
Nice to meet you.

1044
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,524
Oh, yes. Nice to meet you too.

1045
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,362
-Yes, have a seat.
-Thank you, brother.

1046
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,340
I remember now.

1047
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,301
-Yoon Hee-jin.
-Baek-ho!

1048
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:38,680
When I think about it,
I was happiest six years ago.

1049
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,806
Mi-kyung.

1050
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,477
When I notice you're lying,
I'm supposed to act like I don't, right?

1051
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,938
Ong-ju ran away.

1052
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,399
We have to sneak Ong-ju out
as quietly as possible.

1053
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:51,651
Someone stop her.

1054
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:53,444
Stop her.

1055
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,530
No! I mean…

1056
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,492
Are you… my boyfriend?

1057
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,912
I never agreed to that.

1058
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,459
