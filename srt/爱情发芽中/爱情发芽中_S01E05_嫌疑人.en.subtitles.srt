THE POTATO LAB

00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,674
TODAY'S THE DAY

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,385
He doesn't care about our work,
so why is he even here?

4
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,344
He's so overbearing!

5
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,807
Why would she lie like that?

6
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,250
What?

7
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,710
What do you need me to do?

8
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,631
First, let's pull this down.

9
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:26,021
POTATO LAB

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,902
EPISODE 5
PERSON OF INTEREST

11
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,113
There's a shower in the rest area.
On the second floor, to the right.

12
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,074
Okay. You can go first.

13
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,118
That's okay. There's warm water
in the Work Team bathroom.

14
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,329
-Then I'll head over there…
-Come on!

15
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,376
If we're going to keep arguing
over who gets to be nicer…

16
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,503
-should we just shower together?
-Oh, no.

17
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,797
Point taken. Great work today.

18
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,840
You too.

19
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,432
Oh, wow.

20
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,267
The thunder just won't go away.

21
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,479
Do you want to have dinner?

22
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,705
SUNNYEO FOOD POTATO RAMYEON
SPICY FLAVOR

23
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,092
I told you I don't want ramyeon.

24
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,094
-These are both for me.
-I see.

25
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,646
This smells amazing.

26
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,941
Great work today. Bon appétit!

27
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,651
You too.

28
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,744
By the way, Mr. So.

29
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,371
Why were you at the lab?

30
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,207
You showed up out of nowhere.

31
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,295
I had some papers to look at.
It was a coincidence.

32
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,379
At 2 a.m.?

33
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,591
Your life must be so boring.

34
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,179
Anyway, thanks.
I was glad to see you back there.

35
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm glad I could help.

36
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,864
Is this also one of your responsibilities?

37
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,158
What do you mean?

38
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,452
In an emergency situation like tonight,

39
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,788
you came to the lab and took care of it.

40
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,289
Oh, that.

41
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,959
No, not at all.

42
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,003
As someone once told me,

43
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,672
I'm a redundant worker with no main job.

44
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,550
So I don't have
any important responsibilities.

45
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,762
Then why did you come?

46
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,264
Did someone call you?

47
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,099
Come on, I'm trying to eat here.

48
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,435
No one needs to call me for this.

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,563
A local warning was issued
for heavy rain and wind.

50
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,774
What if a greenhouse gets destroyed?

51
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,402
We'd lose tens of thousands
of samples growing there,

52
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,238
and our four-year-old potatoes

53
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,657
would be dead before
ever hitting Daeseolryeong.

54
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,618
We put so much effort into them.
I can't let that happen.

55
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,246
Even if I were in mourning or in jail,
I'd still come.

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,081
Are you saying…

57
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,918
that you came here without being asked,
even though it's not your job,

58
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,879
just because you were concerned
about the potatoes?

59
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,050
Why do you keep asking?

60
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,054
Are you going to tell me off
for trying too hard

61
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,348
when I'm going to get fired anyway?

62
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,268
I'm not telling you off.
I just find it interesting.

63
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,521
Sorry?

64
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,440
You go out of your way
to do hard work that goes unnoticed.

65
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,693
You get reprimanded
so that someone else won't.

66
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,112
I don't know why

67
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,156
you make choices where you lose
more than you gain.

68
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,325
It's quite intriguing.

69
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,245
That's why I find you…

70
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,998
interesting.

71
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,889
Do you think I'm dumb?
It's not like I always lose.

72
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,725
Also…

73
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,395
I'm telling you this because
I've lived a little longer than you have.

74
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,857
Rather than always
looking out for yourself,

75
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,484
being honest and earnest

76
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,612
helps you get more out of life.

77
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,490
People who don't know that
are the dumb ones.

78
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,745
By the way, I'm a bit confused.

79
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,372
How did you see Ms. Jang's message?

80
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,750
I went through so much to delete that.

81
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,002
On my laptop at home.

82
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,671
Wow.

83
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,342
I thought I was going to get away with it.

84
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,262
Ah, that's a shame.

85
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,600
Don't worry.

86
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,728
I won't bring it up again.

87
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,522
Do you swear?

88
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,524
No holding grudges.

89
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,903
You can't be difficult
or refuse to sign my paperwork.

90
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,489
Promise me.

91
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,585
This is a bit…

92
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,920
childish, right?

93
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,683
I promise.

94
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,495
Man, I need to get out of this business.

95
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,081
Get in line. I'm leaving first.

96
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,542
Sorry we're late.

97
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,172
Chief.

98
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,635
Oh my.

99
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,104
He is our chief after all.

100
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,148
Coming to the lab on a night like this.

101
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,775
I thought he didn't care about potatoes,

102
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,319
but he came and did all the hard work.

103
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,197
What about me, you guys?

104
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,615
It was hard work for me too.

105
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,909
Of course it was. We know that.

106
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,703
You saved us from catastrophe.

107
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,538
Well, I thought you weren't aware.

108
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,540
I was gonna rub it in your face.

109
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,961
All right. Quit yapping
and go get some sleep.

110
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,922
We'll take care of the rest.

111
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,634
Thanks. I'm gonna go pass out now.

112
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,594
-Okay.
-Bye.

113
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,471
Oh, right. The pots that got wet…

114
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,973
I put them inside.
Make sure you check on them.

115
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,349
-Of course.
-Thanks.

116
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,186
Wait, one more thing…

117
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,147
If I'm not up by lunch tomorrow,
you need to call 911.

118
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,190
-Okay?
-Okay!

119
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,357
Okay!

120
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,822
Oh, man.

121
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,580
Ay yi yi.

122
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,676
Damn.

123
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,013
Why the hell is he on my mind?

124
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,182
Whatever.

125
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,438
I have failed to find any proof

126
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,482
that you are an asset
to developing new varieties.

127
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,151
Do you think I just came to work
without any goals?

128
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,111
My goal

129
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,739
is to develop a potato variety
and name it after me.

130
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,577
As for results…

131
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,766
LAYOFF LIST

DIRECTOR SO BAEK-HO

135
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,041
Here.

136
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,211
Thank you.

137
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,721
Who's that?

138
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,182
What?

139
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,018
It's okay, sir. I can get it.

140
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,686
Do we have a guest coming today?

141
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,937
No.

142
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,071
All set!

143
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,782
Goodbye.

144
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,711
Nice to meet you.

145
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,298
This place is beautiful.
It's surrounded by trees.

146
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,091
Okay, thank you?

147
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,853
So where is Ward B?

148
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,231
Ward B? Over there.

149
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,858
There? Thank you.

150
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,693
Sure.

151
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,697
Why is she going there?

152
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,575
Maybe she's his sister.

153
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,119
She looks nothing like him.

154
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,163
It can't be his friend.

155
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,792
Maybe she's here
to proselytize or sell something.

156
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,677
-Girlfriend?
-Girlfriend?

157
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,602
Well, well.

158
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,105
Yes.

159
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,573
Hey, Kyung-mi! Red alert!

160
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,200
-Come here.
-What? Why?

161
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,576
Listen.

162
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,038
What? Did you go to the sauna without me?

163
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:09,998
No way.

164
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,292
You wouldn't have fun
without me, your soulmate.

165
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,461
That would be a betrayal
and I wouldn't forgive you, Kim Mi-kyung.

166
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,172
Did you just forget
what you were about to tell me?

167
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,966
What?

168
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,138
Did you know
about So Baek-ho's girlfriend?

169
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,891
-What?
-So Baek-ho's girlfriend!

170
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,893
Hwan-kyung and I
met his girlfriend earlier.

171
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,229
What are you…

172
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,774
Did she say that she was his girlfriend?

173
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,652
Are we talking about
the So Baek-ho that lives here?

174
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,363
She didn't say that, but I'm 99% sure.

175
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,907
She just came here
and asked where Ward B was,

176
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,535
then just put in the password
and let herself in.

177
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,579
Is that not girlfriend behavior?

178
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,373
-Maybe she's a thief.
-Hey! This is no time for jokes.

179
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,042
-What?
-Get it together. Come with me.

180
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,710
Where are we going?

181
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,005
We have to go find out
if she really is his girlfriend.

182
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,341
If she is, he's dead.

183
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,426
He seduced you and deceived you.

184
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,804
It's not his girlfriend.
He's not the type to have one.

185
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,807
More importantly,
it has nothing to do with me.

186
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,809
I don't care
if he has a girlfriend or not.

187
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,936
I see.

188
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,773
You don't care at all?

189
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,984
No. Let's ask Hwan-kyung
to make us kimchi stew.

190
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,194
I feel like soup.

191
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,405
Now is not the time for kimchi stew!

192
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,407
Hey!

193
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,583
A girlfriend?

194
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,834
Yeah, right.

195
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,755
What woman in her right mind
would fall for someone like that?

196
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,729
Someone might fall…

197
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,566
for him.

198
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,920
Is it true? Is she really his girlfriend?

199
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,380
I knew it. You do care.

200
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,675
I don't. I'm just curious.

201
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,975
Shut up and suit up.
Camouflage is spying 101.

202
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,853
Disgusting!
These are Hwan-kyung's clothes.

203
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,521
He's cleaner than either of us.

204
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,898
That's true.

205
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,903
Here, take a look.

206
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,748
You said one night.

207
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,501
That's more than one night's luggage.

208
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,420
Did I say one night?

209
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,338
That must've been a typo.

210
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,591
I meant to say "indefinitely."

211
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,886
I don't even know
how long I'm staying here.

212
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm uncomfortable
living with another person.

213
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,849
I don't have the money to stay anywhere.

214
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,476
Show some sympathy.

215
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,562
I'm supposed to believe
that Yoon Hee-jin is flat broke?

216
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,897
All I have is stocks.

217
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,609
My mom doesn't know I'm back in Korea,
so I can't use my cards.

218
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,905
I was going to splurge with Ki-se's card,
but he's already frozen it.

219
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,615
And the cash that I had left

220
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,743
has been donated to a casino.

221
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,161
A casino?

222
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,163
-What is wrong with you?
-I swear!

223
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,541
I, Yoon Hee-jin,
as an extrovert and a night owl,

224
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,668
will make sure you don't see me

225
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,463
from the moment you wake up
until you go to sleep.

226
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,146
No ukulele playing after 9 p.m.

227
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,482
Okay.

228
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,859
Don't try to do
the dishes, laundry, or chores.

229
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:11,239
It's better if you don't help.
Also, don't bring anybody here.

230
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,283
If you invite strangers over
for food and drinks,

231
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,536
you're kicked out immediately. Got it?

232
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,662
Okey-dokey.

233
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,789
Is your hair washed?

234
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,915
-Three days ago.
-Get out.

235
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,464
Be honest with me.

236
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,550
After that intense kiss the other night--

237
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,802
I told you it was a light peck.

238
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,139
After that light peck,

239
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,975
did nothing happen between you two?

240
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,397
I wish he would
get struck by lightning immediately.

241
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,481
What do you think?

242
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,609
Do you like to imagine scenarios

243
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,695
where people you're into are in pain?

244
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,491
The term for that is
"perverted," Mi-kyung.

245
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,617
Jeez!

246
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,753
Oh no. She saw me.

247
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,922
-What?
-Oh no.

248
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,597
Holy moly, guacamole.

249
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,432
I'll be right there. Just a second.

250
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,143
-Run away!
-Let's go.

251
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,687
-Hold on.
-Oh my gosh!

252
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,107
No! What do we do?

253
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,984
-Is she coming over?
-I don't know!

254
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,486
Move!

255
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,572
Is that my military uniform?

256
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,781
Right!

257
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,327
Gosh. Get out of the way!

258
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,286
No.

259
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,039
Jeez.

260
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,587
Hey, we meet again.

261
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,255
Yes, hello.

262
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,382
Are you by yourself?

263
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,970
You're all here. Great.

264
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,723
USB Guesthouse family,

265
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,643
you're all invited
to the welcome party for Yoon Hee-jin!

266
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,355
Ta-da! Here.

267
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,316
This is your ticket.

268
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,652
Who's Yoon Hee-jin?

269
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,904
I am.

270
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,408
You're all welcome.

271
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,874
She set this up all by herself?

272
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,252
I thought the Ward B guest was vegetarian.

273
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,213
I guess he grills meat for his girlfriend.

274
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,925
So what if he does? Anyone would.

275
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,513
YOON HEE JIN

276
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,432
I'm sorry, but this is non-alcoholic wine.

277
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,080
I don't usually go
for the non-alcoholic options,

278
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,124
but Baek-ho doesn't let me drink.

279
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,709
He says I'm trouble when I'm drunk.

280
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,002
So let's have a real drink
when he's not around.

281
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,589
I found the best craft beer brewery
in the country. It's in Gangneung.

282
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,508
Are you talking about Irish Pub?

283
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,843
Do you know that place?

284
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,513
That's crazy! I already made
a friend who's just like me!

285
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,597
I go there sometimes.

286
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,640
-You do?
-Yes.

287
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,518
What is that cheesy smile on his face?

288
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,645
What's taking so long?
Our guests are getting hungry.

289
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,397
-Almost done.
-Okay.

290
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,778
Looks great.

291
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,994
How long has it been for you two?

292
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,663
Us? When did we first meet?

293
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,998
When we were 15?

294
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,125
-Sixteen.
-Right. Sixteen.

295
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,711
That's a long time. You two must be close.

296
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,422
We used to basically live together.

297
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,550
I've been traveling a lot,
so we don't see much of each other.

298
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,720
You can be honest.

299
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,931
You cry yourself to sleep at night
because you miss me, don't you?

300
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,061
He must've been crying very quietly.

301
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,773
Because we had absolutely no idea.

302
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,359
As if he was hiding it on purpose.

303
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,867
-Keep eating.
-Okay.

304
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,660
-I'll get some more.
-Thank you.

305
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,663
Help yourselves.

306
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,709
We have pork neck, shoulder, and belly.

307
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,420
Since the food's ready, should we toast?

308
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,588
Cheers.

309
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,548
-Yes, cheers.
-Sure.

310
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,842
Nice to meet you.

311
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,098
I'm asking officially.
Will you go out with me?

312
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,935
What are your hobbies, Hwan-kyung?

313
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,520
I like to read.

314
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,104
So do I! Favorite writers?

315
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,356
Lately, I've been into…

316
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,399
Looks delicious.

317
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,652
That's so good.

318
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,366
-Is it good?
-It is.

319
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,375
Since you were sixteen?

320
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,002
You're practically married.

321
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,091
"What kind of flowers do I like?"

322
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,927
Why would you ask that?

323
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,680
What kind of crap were you trying to pull?

324
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,516
Ms. Kim, is there a problem?

325
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,604
Are you serious right now?

326
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,526
You're way more shameless
than I thought.

327
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,610
I'm sorry?

328
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,655
Put that handsome face away.

329
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,659
I know that that's
your secret weapon, your strategy.

330
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,452
I'm not falling for it ever again.

331
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,507
I have to ask my neighbors.

332
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,677
Do you know who Baek-ho likes?

333
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,929
-Sorry?
-Hee-jin!

334
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,431
Oh, sorry.

335
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,726
Let me rephrase that.
The person he "finds interesting."

336
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,562
I know there's someone
but he wouldn't tell me.

337
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,480
I'm dying to know.

338
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,274
What is going on right now?

339
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,401
Are you two not together?

340
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,864
Why? Why did you think we were?

341
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,700
I'm clearly an all-loving free spirit,

342
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,784
a troubadour, a vagabond.

343
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,829
And he's just a slave to capitalism.

344
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,499
I should be offended
to be mistaken as his girlfriend.

345
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,002
We're just friends.

346
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,378
Is that so?

347
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,965
They're not together.
She's not his girlfriend.

348
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,342
Be quiet.

349
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,595
Now it's your turn to tell me.

350
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,098
Have you ever seen him
bring someone over at night?

351
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,391
I've never done that.

352
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,226
I heard that you work with him.

353
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,687
Is there a person of interest
that I should know about?

354
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,522
Does he ask around for someone

355
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,900
or just stay late to help them?

356
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,945
I'm in desperate need of a witness.

357
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,210
Well…

358
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,671
I'm not sure.

359
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,800
I haven't noticed him
getting close to anyone.

360
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,135
That sounds about right.

361
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,013
He's like a robot.

362
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,683
Even if he did like someone,
that person wouldn't even realize it.

363
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,976
Drop it, will you?

364
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,436
All right, I'll let it go for now,

365
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,981
but soon I'm going to find out who it is.

366
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,608
The woman who helped
this Tin Man find his heart.

367
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,904
I'm having so much fun right now.

368
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,072
What?

369
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,449
What is it?

370
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,932
Mr. Lee.

371
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,560
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

372
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,978
No, I'm fine.

373
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,355
I've just been on a stakeout
and driving all day.

374
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,732
I just feel stiff.

375
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,483
Of course. I appreciate it.

376
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,526
Thanks.

377
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,281
I'll give you the report for today.

378
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,241
Yes, okay.

379
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,202
At 11:30 a.m.,

380
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,371
your ex-wife checked out.

381
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,707
And then?

382
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,669
She found out that you froze the card
and made some phone calls.

383
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,256
FYI, she spoke very ill of you
on those calls.

384
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,633
-Just FYI.
-You don't need to tell me--

385
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,846
Anyway, she got in a taxi
and went to Youngeul-ri, Pyeongwon-gun.

386
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,058
What does this say? USA?

387
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,980
She went to USB Guesthouse in Pyeongwon.

388
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,650
A guesthouse? That's unexpected.

389
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,944
That's all I saw.

390
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,365
So she won't be coming back to Seoul.

391
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,994
Thanks for your work today.

392
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,706
Get some treatment
at a traditional medicine clinic.

393
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,416
It's on the company.

394
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,212
I love you, sir. Yes!

395
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,967
Oh, Mr. Lee.

396
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,782
Jeez.

397
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,081
-What?
-What was that?

398
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,875
I was hoping for a heart-to-heart
with you, but you ran off.

399
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,627
Of course I did.

400
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,712
You were going to say,
"She was talking about you."

401
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,922
"Am I right?"

402
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,298
I knew you'd overreact.

403
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,385
She was talking about you. Am I right?

404
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,595
-I'm hanging up.
-Why?

405
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,223
Drop the act and admit it already.

406
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,641
He likes you too.

407
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,186
Come on. He doesn't like me.

408
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,355
And even if he does, I don't like him.

409
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:32,025
Why? Because he's handsome,
successful, and he smells nice?

410
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,361
Or because he works for Wonhan?

411
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:38,073
Mi-kyung, feuding families
can't stop true love.

412
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,200
Once upon a time,

413
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,704
there were these lovers
called Romeo and Juliet.

414
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,913
-Come on.
-Right?

415
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,540
Hello?

416
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,333
What?

417
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,796
Why am I friends with her?

418
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:12,983
POTATOES SAVE THE WORLD!

419
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:13,942
No way.

420
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,237
What crazy bastard
fires the woman he likes?

421
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,784
Whatever.

422
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,495
Let's get some work done.

423
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,792
EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION

424
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,130
ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED
SHORT-TERM, SAME-DAY PAYMENT

425
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,473
NEW MAIL ALERT
PMI TASK FORCE

426
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,474
What?

427
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,726
PMI Task Force?

428
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,947
Even if he liked someone,
that person wouldn't even realize it.

429
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,350
Hi, there.

430
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,143
Are you coming from a run?

431
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,147
Yes. I needed to clear my head.

432
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,817
-Have some.
-Thanks.

433
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,568
It's for the dog, but it's clean.

434
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,614
No, thank you. I'm good.

435
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,907
-I'll be going now.
-Sure.

436
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,208
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

437
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,302
This is business-related,
so please don't take this the wrong way.

438
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,596
Would you say
that Ms. Kim can take a hint?

439
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,057
My sister? Take a hint?

440
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,894
Take a hint…

441
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,816
Well…

442
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,569
A hint?

443
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,531
Sometimes she can, sometimes she can't.

444
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,579
I just…

445
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,874
wasted 19 seconds of my life
for a completely unhelpful answer.

446
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,172
What just happened?

447
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,299
I'm going to tell on him.

448
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,217
Ong-ju!

449
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,846
Ong-ju! It's the Ward B guest!

450
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,727
Out of nowhere?

451
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,312
PMI?

452
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,647
You're on the PMI Task Force?

453
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,982
What? What's PMI?

454
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:02,652
Integrating accounting systems
and reorganizing management systems

455
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,696
after two companies merge.

456
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,450
In short, it's the process of putting
Wonhan Retail and Sunnyeo Food

457
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,036
in a blender and mixing them together.

458
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,163
No! Does that mean
you won't be coming here anymore?

459
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,082
No, I'll still be working here.

460
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,834
-Right.
-I'll just go to corporate once a week.

461
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,294
Wow, MK.

462
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,589
You're finally moving up
to the control center.

463
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,466
This is not a good thing.

464
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,385
They need to take care of their own stuff.

465
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,678
They can't just take one of us away…

466
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,431
Are they paying for the travel expenses?

467
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,141
Yes. Quite a lot.

468
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,893
-Nice.
-That's strange.

469
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,854
I heard that they finished
forming the task force last week.

470
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:41,274
Mr. Jeong from Process Development
and Ms. Lee from Food Certification

471
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,609
told me they were called in.

472
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,405
Really? Then why did Ms. Kim
get notified just now?

473
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,782
It is strange that they would tell her

474
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,159
to come to corporate the night before.

475
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,329
This doesn't pass the smell test.

476
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,123
Maybe you shouldn't go.

477
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,750
You know I have to.

478
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,378
I'll go and find out. Don't worry.

479
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,004
-Okay. Safe travels.
-Thanks.

480
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,756
-You got this.
-Good luck!

481
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:18,979
VISITOR

482
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,420
How long has it been?

483
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,213
Too long! How have you been?

484
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,673
Great. You?

485
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,509
I've barely managed to keep this job.

486
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,012
Deputy General Manager Kim
and General Manager Park, all gone.

487
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,930
I heard that Chief Hong had to resign.

488
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,683
Yes, he did.

489
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,394
Those darn Wonhan guys.

490
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,867
He's quite handsome.

491
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,083
Is…

492
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,420
Chief So leading the PMI Task Force?

493
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,797
No, I heard that it's…

494
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,382
Hello.

495
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,219
Good morning. Please, take a seat.

496
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,520
Hello everyone.

497
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,063
Thank you for being here.

498
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,233
I'll be leading the PMI Task Force.

499
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,152
I'm Park Ki-se
from the Strategic Planning Department.

500
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,111
Nice to meet you.

501
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,916
-Safe travels.
-See you around.

502
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,626
See you soon.

503
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,841
You can leave that to Mr. So.

504
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,301
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

505
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,511
Excuse me!

506
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,846
We…

507
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,431
met at the Potato Lab, right?

508
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,810
What was your name?

509
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,062
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung.

510
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,022
Right. Nice to see you again.

511
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,611
I had something I wanted to ask you.

512
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,154
Should we talk in my office?

513
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,497
Please.

514
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,876
This is my office.

515
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,843
Thanks for coming all the way here.

516
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,723
Isn't visiting corporate wonderful?

517
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,600
Doesn't it make you motivated?

518
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:04,894
What is this?

519
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,610
I think you mean, "Thank you."

520
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,487
What do I have to thank you for?

521
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,282
For making me come here,
where everyone recognizes me?

522
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,745
Or for adding another responsibility
to my already heavy workload?

523
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,499
For extending your career lifespan
when you're about to get fired next month.

524
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:27,917
What?

525
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,837
PMI is one of Wonhan's
most important projects at the moment.

526
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,007
You're part of a team
put together by the Executive Director.

527
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,342
To make it clearer,

528
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,345
even So Baek-ho can't touch you right now.

529
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,304
I'm…

530
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,060
pulling strings for you.

531
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,190
No.

532
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,775
I'd rather get fired.

533
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,278
If my other choice is you helping me
and seeing you weekly,

534
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,155
I'd rather be unemployed.

535
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,034
Please fire me. Please?

536
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,455
You can't talk to me like that.

537
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,376
You think…

538
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,920
I'm only doing this to help you?

539
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,130
Six years at Wonhan
and six years at Sunnyeo Food.

540
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,007
You're the only one of 4,500 employees

541
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,218
who's worked in both companies.

542
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,262
Who would be a better fit than you?

543
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,931
Let's see.

544
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,017
Maybe any of the other 4,499 people

545
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,727
who were never engaged to you?

546
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,312
Come on.

547
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,190
You want to keep studying potatoes.

548
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,567
You can. I'll let you.

549
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,362
If you can give up an ounce of your pride.

550
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,489
Hey.

551
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,867
Why are you doing this to me?

552
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,620
-I told you, there's no one--
-Stop bullshitting me!

553
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,832
Why do you keep bothering me, Park Ki-se?

554
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,799
Because I pity you.

555
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,224
Everyone who started
at this company with us

556
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,851
is now at least a section chief,

557
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,812
while you're just an assistant manager
at that ridiculous lab.

558
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,356
I think it's pitiful,

559
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,650
and I feel bad.

560
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:19,529
I feel like it's my fault
that your life sucks.

561
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,574
That's how I feel.

562
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,909
That's probably the reason.

563
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,004
I'll give you ten seconds.

564
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,714
What?

565
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,259
Take that back…

566
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,429
or start running.

567
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,014
What did you say?

568
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,974
-Ten.
-Mi-kyung.

569
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,852
-Nine.
-Mi-kyung.

570
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,978
Mi-kyung, we're at work.

571
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,981
-Eight.
-Wait, Mi-kyung.

572
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,525
Mi-kyung! Please, stop!

573
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,568
Hold on.

574
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,613
Sir, Mr. So is here.

575
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,156
Just let him in.

576
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,282
No.

577
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,497
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
PARK KI-SE

578
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,000
Mr. So.

579
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,516
Why are you here, Ms. Kim?

580
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,227
Well…

581
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,690
We were talking about the lab.

582
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,611
She told me
that she had a lot on her mind.

583
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,029
That's right.

584
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:47,492
We had a very productive conversation.

585
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,581
In the future,
if you have something to discuss,

586
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,835
you can come to me and not
the Executive Director. I'm close by.

587
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,546
I will.

588
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,800
Then I'll be on my way.

589
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,827
Lucky bastard.

590
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,621
He'd be dead if it wasn't for So Baek-ho.

591
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,213
Life is so unfair.

592
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,465
Did you see Park Ki-se?

593
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,885
He was wearing a watch
that costs more than my car.

594
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,053
It makes me wonder
what I'm even doing here.

595
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,431
Marry the chairman's daughter,
and you're set for life.

596
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,558
Not just anyone can become Cinderella.

597
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,603
One of my college friends
went to high school with him,

598
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,647
and he wore a hand-me-down uniform
since he couldn't afford a new one.

599
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,649
You really have to come from nothing

600
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:03,860
to be able to suck up
to the chairman without any pride.

601
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,279
Of course he does whatever she says.

602
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,072
She transformed an poor, pitiful nobody

603
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,741
into an executive director.

604
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,202
Is it too late for me to seduce the CEO?

605
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,288
-You're too much!
-Is it?

606
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:23,171
Jeez, why are there
so many damn flies around here?

607
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,633
Sorry. Did I startle you?

608
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,054
Some people who can't tell
their workplace from a dive bar

609
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,722
must've taken a dump somewhere.

610
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,766
I keep hearing flies buzzing.

611
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,808
It's so annoying.

612
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,186
-Let's go.
-Yes.

613
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,821
Executive director, what bull!

614
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,158
Listen to what they're saying
behind your back.

615
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,917
I don't want to work.

616
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,878
I really don't want to work.

617
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,464
I don't want to do anything.

618
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,258
My head is empty…

619
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,220
Ong-ju! You can have lunch
by yourself, right?

620
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,390
-There's yukgaejang in the fridge.
-Why? Are you going out to eat?

621
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,228
What are you going to eat?

622
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,562
Where are you going?

623
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,816
What are you going to get?

624
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,151
Can you pick up
something for me? I'll wait.

625
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm going to a craft beer brewery.
Go ahead and eat.

626
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,947
Craft beer…

627
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,742
Are you going with the woman in Ward B?

628
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:36,661
Wow.

629
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,748
I don't believe this. You animal.

630
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,585
Look at you.
The bachelor making his move.

631
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,587
Making what move?

632
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,298
I asked you to go there with me,
but you said no!

633
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,634
I've been going all by myself,

634
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,886
so I never get to order the meal deals.

635
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,430
All right.

636
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,932
Go enjoy your meal deal

637
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,395
with the beautiful lady.

638
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,438
Come on.

639
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,273
You never wash your hands.

640
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,240
I wonder why…

641
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,160
I find him so annoying today.

642
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,711
One, please.

643
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,963
Take a seat. Wait.

644
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,174
The tonkatsu combo and a curry udon.

645
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,719
You remember me?
I haven't been here in years.

646
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,056
No other lady around here
would order two full meals but you.

647
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,599
How could I forget?

648
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,684
I'll have the same as last time.

649
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:42,852
-Okay.
-Spicy udon, please.

650
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,145
Thank you.

651
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,606
Why are you sitting there? Sit over there.

652
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,444
Well…

653
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,323
Could I please sit here just for today?

654
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,574
No can do.

655
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,035
I can't seat all solo customers
wherever they want.

656
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,245
Noon customers
sit in the order they came.

657
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,705
-Over there.
-Please…

658
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,749
-Seven servings of tonkatsu.
-Coming right up.

659
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,334
-No…
-In the order you came, please.

660
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,835
Yes, ma'am.

661
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:09,754
But…

662
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,839
My goodness.

663
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,144
We keep…

664
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,439
ending up eating together.

665
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,398
Guess so.

666
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,736
Are you heading to Pyeongwon right away
or staying longer?

667
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,781
I'll be in my office for a while
then I'm heading back.

668
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,782
I see.

669
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:39,951
I see.

670
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,287
So you know about this place too.

671
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,916
This place has always been popular.
When I used to work here--

672
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,043
What did you discuss earlier?

673
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,254
Earlier in the office.

674
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,797
You had a lot on your mind?

675
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,423
Right.

676
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,260
Well, we discussed…

677
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,804
the direction of the lab,

678
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,806
employee treatment, and things like that.

679
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,516
Since I'm on the PMI team now.

680
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,603
You never thought of coming to me first?
I'm part of the Potato Lab.

681
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,398
Are you mad at me right now?

682
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,482
For going over your head?

683
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,733
No.

684
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,028
I have no intention of reprimanding
a subordinate for such a reason.

685
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,622
I'm not mad. I was just wondering.

686
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,625
Do you think I'm that difficult
and hard to talk to?

687
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,669
I'm your direct superior,

688
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,629
but you'd rather
talk to the executive director?

689
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,423
See? You're mad…

690
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,009
Why are you so fired up?

691
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,262
There's no big conspiracy behind this.

692
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,263
It just happened--

693
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,349
You've never expressed
your concerns to me before!

694
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,061
Listen, Chief.

695
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,397
Expressing my concerns
to my boss who's going to fire me

696
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,150
would make me a crazy person.
Wouldn't it?

697
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,235
Besides, I don't understand

698
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,738
why you'd get mad
about something like this.

699
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,032
I didn't fail to officially
report something to you.

700
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,202
Do I need your permission
to discuss work with a colleague?

701
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,829
I have free will.
You can't even allow that?

702
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,706
Ms. Kim.

703
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,999
Okay, then.

704
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:13,085
From now on, I won't open my mouth
without your permission.

705
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,337
Oh, look at that.

706
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,880
My lips are moving right now.

707
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,048
Do I have your permission?

708
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,968
What about food?
Will you let me eat?

709
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,803
Should I sign a slave contract?

710
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,139
Saying that my lips
belong to you from now on?

711
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,017
Ridiculous.

NEWSFLASH
KIM MI-KYUNG, 36

713
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,199
ANNOUNCES SHE'S A PERVERT IN PUBLIC

714
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,283
Damn it.

715
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,327
No need for a slave contract.

716
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,121
You're free to do whatever you want
with your own body.

717
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,165
If you'll excuse me.

718
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,627
Where are you going?
If you leave right now,

719
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,795
it'd make me look weird.

720
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,171
-Check, please.
-Sure.

721
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,135
Damn it.

722
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,102
It's still good.

723
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,896
Enjoy your meal.

724
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,157
STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT
DIRECTOR SO BAEK-HO

725
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,284
Mr. So.

726
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,496
Wow.

727
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,750
Doesn't it feel like you're home,
being back in corporate after so long?

728
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,751
You know,

729
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:39,213
Wonhan doesn't feel the same without you.

730
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,173
Do you need something?

731
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,012
It's about the lab layoff list.

732
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,555
Is it almost done?

733
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,974
Mr. Park wants to know.

734
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:54,937
Mr. So?

735
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,648
-Sir.
-Yes.

736
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,400
Well…

737
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,363
Could you tell him
that I'm still working on it?

738
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,074
I see. It's going to take longer.

739
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,702
I'll let him know.

740
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,803
-I'm here.
-Hey, you.

741
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:28,971
Hey.

742
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,767
Let me sit down.

743
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,353
-Jeez.
-Can I take a sip?

744
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:36,771
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

745
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,317
I don't even need to ask.

746
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,611
Something happened at Wonhan.

747
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,029
Yikes.

748
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,782
I swear that something's
in the air over there.

749
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,575
I feel bad every time I go there.

750
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,578
Tell them you're out.

751
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,121
You're about to get laid off.

752
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,998
They can't tell you to come to corporate.

753
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,166
That's right.

754
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,710
You're counting your days right now.

755
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,046
I really wish I could say no,

756
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,173
but I think I'm going to stay.

757
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,800
It was assigned to me anyway.

758
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,678
Could we get a pint and some sea snails?

759
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,515
What a carefree person.

760
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,143
-Ms. Kim?
-Yes?

761
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,486
What is this?

762
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,780
Your parting gift.

763
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,286
You really didn't have to.

764
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,122
It's nothing.

765
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,291
You've helped me a lot.

766
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,044
I wanted to do something for you.

767
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,174
GANGWON GIFT VOUCHER

768
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,886
You didn't have to.

769
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,683
You like the steamed buns
from Pyeongwon market.

770
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,560
You can use those to get them.

771
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,353
The fish cake stand next door

772
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,606
is famous for their pepper fishcake bars.
Make sure to try them.

773
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,152
Seul-gi.

774
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,654
If you're ever in Sokchon,
try the pumpkin sikhye,

775
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,822
and in Yeongwol…

776
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,200
try the Yeongwol sorghum pancakes!

777
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,954
I will.

778
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,498
I promise I'll go there

779
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,835
and try all of them.

780
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,755
-I don't want to leave.
-Stop it already!

781
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,340
Nobody's dying.

782
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:31,927
We can still hang out whenever,
even after you leave.

783
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,598
Right, because we're the Potato Gang.

784
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,392
Gang membership is for life.

785
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,227
We are…

786
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,896
-The Potato Gang!
-The Potato Gang!

787
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,679
What are all the ghosts doing,

788
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,265
not haunting So Baek-ho?

789
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,479
Hey.

790
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,149
Here.

791
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,692
No thanks. I'm okay.

792
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,236
Did you just say no to carbs?

793
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,326
You're acting strange,
and your eyes are all dead.

794
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,624
You used a bar of soap for everything.

795
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,502
You only do that when you're depressed
and sick of it all.

796
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,671
I'm just a little tired.

797
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,382
Who is it?

798
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,552
Who took the appetite away
from my carb queen?

799
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,012
Bring them to me!

800
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,439
Right.

801
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,815
I should definitely cut her off.

802
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,234
I have something to tell you.

803
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,570
Lately…

804
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:40,449
I've been hearing a strange noise.

805
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,368
A strange noise?

806
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,619
Yes, it's like…

807
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:47,081
a creaking sound,
like old metal rubbing together.

808
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,501
Sometimes it sounds like
a person whistling. Listen to this.

809
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,634
That sound right there.

810
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,512
-Oh, that?
-What do you mean?

811
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,182
I don't hear anything.

812
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,433
Sorry?

813
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,601
I don't hear anything.

814
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,646
That sound just now…

815
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,691
You've recorded absolutely nothing.

816
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,818
Well…

817
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,737
Give it another listen. There's…

818
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,490
There's an unnatural noise repeating.

819
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,077
There.

820
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,959
What are you talking about?

821
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,545
Do you hear it?

822
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:36,839
I don't.

823
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,928
Mr. So, are you sure…

824
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,139
you're not just hearing things?

825
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:48,517
Do you seriously think
that's what's happening?

826
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,644
It's a possibility.

827
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,231
I'm sure a lot of people hate you
because of your job and personality.

828
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:58,527
And a couple of them
might have passed on already.

829
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,946
-Ms. Kim.
-I'm just saying.

830
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:05,117
I think I'd haunt you if I were a ghost.

831
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,661
I'd follow you everywhere.

832
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,873
Thank you for your input.

833
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,625
But I don't believe in the supernatural.

834
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,502
I'll see you at work.

835
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,796
See you.

836
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,807
Why? Why are you doing this?

837
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:32,728
Why would you injure your brother
just so you can mess with him?

838
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,062
Why are you so mean?

839
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,189
Hey.

840
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,567
If you tell him what that sound is,

841
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,320
I'll hurt more than your toes.

842
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,543
How ridiculous.

843
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,818
What?

844
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,575
I think I'd haunt you if I were a ghost.

845
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,828
I'd follow you everywhere.

846
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,145
You're people.

847
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,647
-Gosh.
-Of course we are!

848
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,858
Did you think we were
wild boars or something?

849
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,402
Why would you scream at us like that?

850
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,779
I'm so sorry.

851
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,199
What brings you here?

852
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,577
-Right.
-We haven't seen you in a while.

853
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,579
We just wanted to say hello.

854
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,289
Is everything okay?

855
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,627
You haven't seen anything strange?

856
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,920
Anything strange?

857
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,423
No. Never mind.

858
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,883
See you around.

859
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,469
You're still good-looking.

860
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,858
Oh my gosh.

861
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,486
Jeez.

862
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:48,548
Guys.

863
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,258
What's the situation? Did he say anything?

864
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,928
He looked scared,

865
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,055
but I don't think he's noticed yet.

866
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,767
Let's just forget about it.
There's nothing we can do.

867
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,019
-Forget about what?
-Oh my God!

868
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,272
What? What are we forgetting about?

869
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,193
Well, sir.

870
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:13,991
Yesterday, we…

871
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,327
made a mistake.

872
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,662
What mistake?

873
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:28,088
This couch is so big and soft.

874
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,298
He's been keeping this to himself?

875
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,092
It's the perfect length.

876
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,012
I know, right?

877
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,598
How great would it be
if this was in the staff lounge?

878
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,183
Exactly!

879
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,271
This place is empty once a week.

880
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:48,525
Let's just use it as our own staff lounge.

881
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,776
Okay, deal!

882
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,405
Oh my gosh,
you should really put that down.

883
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,452
So the chair broke,

884
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,786
and nail polish got everywhere.

885
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,206
We cleaned up after ourselves,

886
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,710
but the chair remains broken.

887
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,212
Have you no conscience?

888
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,465
You're lying to him
just because of a chair?

889
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,926
Go and come clean with him.

890
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,012
Explain the situation
and tell him it's broken.

891
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,389
Offer to get him a new one
if he's really upset.

892
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,768
But what if that chair

893
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,519
-is very expensive?
-Right.

894
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,897
More expensive than our conscience.

895
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,607
What? How much could it be?

896
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,111
-50,000 won?
-What?

897
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,450
100,000 won?

898
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,535
Well…

899
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,957
Let me take off my socks.

900
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,794
No need for that.

901
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,297
In fact, this conversation…

902
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,841
-never happened.
-Mr. Bu!

903
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,719
-Wait!
-Mr. Bu! No!

904
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,054
We're in big trouble.

905
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,188
WONHAN MR. LEE

906
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,405
Hello.

907
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,574
Hello, Mr. So. Did I wake you?

908
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:20,909
Yes, sorry.

909
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,538
I didn't sleep well last night.

910
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,920
I think I'd haunt you if I were a ghost.

911
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,755
I'd follow you everywhere.

912
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,339
What was that?

913
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,230
SUNNYEO SHAMAN
CALL RIGHT NOW

914
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,484
IF YOU HAVE NIGHTMARES
FEEL FOLLOWED

915
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,652
HAVE REGRETS
I'LL SAVE YOU

916
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,202
-It's good.
-Since I paid for these,

917
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,537
-you do the dishes.
-What are you doing?

918
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,039
Stop fighting.

919
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,333
-What's that?
-What?

920
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,381
What's going on?

921
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:55,939
What?

922
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,074
Mr. So!

923
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:08,952
Mr. So!

924
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,126
I pray to thee.

925
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,836
Guardian spirit of Mount Taebaek.

926
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,171
-What is happening right now?
-This poor creature

927
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,965
-wishes to escape from his troubles…
-No!

928
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,258
Wait a minute!

929
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:26,344
-What are you doing right now?
-How rude!

930
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,847
How dare you interfere
in the guardian spirit's business?

931
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,348
Forget about the guardian spirit!

932
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:31,766
-Mr. So.
-Must drink…

933
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,393
What is this all about?

934
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,145
Is it because of what I said? The noise?

935
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,771
The noise…

936
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,440
I keep hearing the strange noise.

937
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,109
-I have to drink it.
-That's just the birds!

938
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,113
Sorry?

939
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,616
The birds make that sound.
White's thrush.

940
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,036
For the viewers' information,

941
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,164
White's thrush is known to call
in the mountains on summer nights,

942
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,915
giving them the nickname, "Ghost Bird."

943
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,585
Birds?

944
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,506
Birds?

945
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,591
-Birds!
-Birds!

946
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,676
Birds?

947
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,108
Are you sure this is
what you've been hearing?

948
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,152
I'm sure. This is the noise.

949
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,236
God damn it!

950
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,698
You live in the mountains and you call on
the guardian spirit for some Ghost Birds?

951
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,075
Wrap it up!

952
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,951
Excuse me, Mr. Shaman.

953
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,871
He's from Seoul and didn't know better.

954
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,915
Would you consider a partial refund?

955
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,710
No refund for services
that have already been provided.

956
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,420
Sir.

957
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,216
Excuse me, sir!

958
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:55,141
How can you be so naive?

959
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,728
I was just pulling a prank
and you called a shaman--

960
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,400
He's pissed. Seriously pissed.

961
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,402
What are you doing? Go kiss him.

962
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,070
-Stop it.
-See?

963
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,530
I saw this coming.

964
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,865
Why do you have to
mess with him all the time?

965
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,831
Damn it.

966
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:28,925
SO FROM WARD B

967
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:29,968
Mr. So.

968
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,680
Gosh.

969
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,722
MR. SO

970
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,766
Why is he not reading it?

971
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,662
You're still up.

972
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,581
What is this about?

973
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,249
Well…

974
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,878
-About earlier…
-You don't have to apologize.

975
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,046
-Sorry?
-Your lies might have

976
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,548
started this whole thing,

977
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,967
but I chose to make a big deal out of it.

978
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,263
That may be true,

979
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,140
but if I hadn't lied in the first place--

980
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,767
-Good night.
-Wait a second.

981
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:25,106
I know how upset you must be.

982
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,859
I officially apologize. I'm sorry.

983
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,027
I don't accept.

984
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,990
Come on, I'm deeply sorry.

985
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:37,243
Okay, so you can continue
to be deeply sorry.

986
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,079
Okay, I'll continue…

987
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,251
"Continue"?

988
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,589
What? Why?

989
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,216
What's that smirk for?

990
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,843
-Do you feel uncomfortable?
-Yes, very much so.

991
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,553
Get used to it.

992
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:59,474
The dynamic between us
where you're always deceiving me

993
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,809
changes right now.

994
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,313
What does that mean…

995
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,572
Whoa!

996
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,701
Did you do that on purpose
to make me feel sorry?

997
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:19,911
No way.

998
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:25,416
You may not know this,
but I lead an extremely careless life.

999
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,460
I'm always apologizing.

1000
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,295
I'm an expert at apologizing.

1001
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:33,216
I'm going to keep apologizing
no matter what.

1002
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,929
What a ridiculous man!

1003
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:12,463
What's this?

1004
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,584
No way! Is this Mr. So's treat?

1005
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,544
-What an amazing guy.
-I'm excited.

1006
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,713
Thank you.

1007
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,215
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the coffee, Mr. Ko.

1008
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:59,302
Thank you.
Should we take a picture together?

1009
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,637
-Here.
-Do you have misutgaru?

1010
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,763
Okay.

1011
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,182
-What are you doing, Mr. Ko?
-Nothing.

1012
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,143
This is amazing. What should I get?

1013
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:30,917
Oh my gosh!

1014
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:48,685
Damn it.

1015
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,402
This is beautiful.

1016
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,196
Both of them being doormats
for each other.

1017
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,864
That's what love is.

1018
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,952
I think they're both
just out of their minds.

1019
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,379
Get out of the way.

1020
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,714
-Hey!
-Come on.

1021
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,632
-Jeez!
-Watch it!

1022
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,052
Damn it.

1023
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,697
I heard you froze your card.

1024
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,616
That's low, even for you.

1025
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,036
It's my card that I gave to her
before the divorce, for emergencies.

1026
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,037
I would argue

1027
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:53,082
that my ex-wife, who's now trying
to use that, is shameless.

1028
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,256
How upset is Hee-jin?

1029
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,967
She was swearing
in Korean, English, and Spanish.

1030
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,094
I'll text them to you.

1031
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,306
Read them when you have time.
It'll take a while.

1032
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,057
I'll translate them for you.

1033
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:12,143
Since your English is not very good.

1034
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,984
Ki-se, have you ever thought about this?

1035
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,736
What if Hee-jin

1036
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:25,364
had married Mr. So instead of you?

1037
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:28,868
So Baek-ho wouldn't have
let her run away like that.

1038
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,161
-Ms. Yoon.
-What?

1039
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,455
It's fun to imagine.

1040
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:39,295
Also, hurry up and bring So Baek-ho back.

1041
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,380
People keep asking me

1042
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,591
why Mr. So is rotting in Pyeongwon.

1043
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,677
I almost told them
that we're keeping him down

1044
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:48,095
because you're jealous.

1045
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,936
God damn it!

1046
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:00,900
Pyeongwon?

1047
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,318
PAYMENT
GRAND MOULTON PYEONGWON

1048
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,277
What is this?

1049
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:06,572
Grand Moulton Pyeongwon?

1050
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,449
Anyway, she got in a taxi

1051
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,493
and went to Youngeul-ri, Pyeongwon-gun.

1052
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,498
Since I'm here in Gangwon-do,
I'd like to see Mr. So.

1053
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,793
Wait a second.

1054
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:21,712
Mr. Lee.

1055
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:24,674
Check where Mr. So is staying
in Pyeongwon. Right now.

1056
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,808
That dummy.

1057
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,017
Rom-com characters

1058
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:37,019
can make up with just one kiss.

1059
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:39,021
Why are you torturing yourself?

1060
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:42,191
Quit being silly.
I don't have the energy.

1061
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,487
Jeez.

1062
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,454
Ong-ju!

1063
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,040
Hwan-kyung!

1064
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:03,337
They're no help at all.

1065
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,923
I'm so tired.

1066
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:12,638
-Who is…
-Come out.

1067
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,776
I know you're here.

1068
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,029
Come out and talk to me.

1069
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,116
Hey, Yoon…

1070
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,407
Whoa.

1071
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,582
This does feel different.

1072
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,085
Hey, Mr. Ko.

1073
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:28,047
Stop being buddy-buddy with me
and focus on your work.

1074
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,227
Oh no. What did I do?

1075
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,105
Oh my gosh.

1076
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,023
What do I do?

1077
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:49,193
PRICE 6,200,000 WON

1078
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,572
Could I…

1079
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,409
pay over 24 months?

1080
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,077
Of course.

1081
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,544
CREDIT PURCHASE

1082
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,554
Darn it.

1083
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,494
Why is So Baek-ho living at your house?

1084
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,455
I'll drive you, Ms. Kim.

1085
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,790
It's not just me, right?

1086
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,793
You felt it too, right?
There's something there, right?

1087
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,254
-Having a good time?
-Yes.

1088
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,006
What is this?

1089
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,592
Is this something
"just coworkers" would do?

1090
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,428
What are you all doing here?

1091
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,598
Is there a reason why I have to go there?

1092
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,307
You like her. You miss her.
You want to be with her.

1093
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:04,518
So why aren't you dating her?

1094
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,604
Just be honest with me!

1095
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,356
What am I to you, Mr. So Baek-ho?

1096
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,571
