1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,955
THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,378
SIX YEARS AGO

3
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,607
I'm here to kidnap you, Park Ki-se.

4
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,902
Come to terminal 2 right now,
and I'll spare your life…

5
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,781
I see.

6
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:14,992
All of a sudden?

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,121
WELCOME BACK, KI-SE

8
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,290
They're here.

9
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,749
-Surprise!
-Welcome back, Ki-se!

10
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,710
Welcome back!

11
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,503
What?

12
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,839
Why is it just you? Where's Ki-se?

13
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,426
He's having dinner
with his teammates from the training.

14
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,345
What? He should've given you a heads-up.

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,140
I waited four hours
without eating anything.

16
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,850
Come on.

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,560
That was pretty
thoughtless of him, though.

18
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,312
It's been six months. Doesn't he miss you?

19
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,064
We've been together for years.
It's not a big deal.

20
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,900
Besides, we'll be together
all the time once we get married.

21
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,777
It's good to spend
time apart when we can.

22
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,863
Wow, this looks good.

23
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,581
-Hey!
-Gosh!

24
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,834
Mi-kyung.

25
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,462
This is one of the little things
I've missed,

26
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,297
like opening the break room door

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,132
and seeing your broad back.

28
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,927
I get that you're happy to see me,
but let's be careful at work.

29
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,804
People will talk.

30
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,847
I have a meeting.

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,571
GROOM PARK KI-SE
AND BRIDE YOON HEE-JIN

32
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,530
What is this?

33
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,908
Why is your name on this?

34
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,748
Say something.

35
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,833
You're…

36
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,253
joking, right?

37
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,089
Right?

38
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,049
This…

39
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,010
can't be true.

40
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,264
You can't do this to me.

41
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,267
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,357
Park Ki-se.

43
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,150
Yoon Hee-jin.

44
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,409
Yoon Hee-jin.

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,624
Start the meeting without me.
I'm going to be late.

46
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,014
Did that surprise you?

47
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,934
There's something I haven't mentioned.

48
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,854
-The truth is--
-I remember now.

49
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,814
Yoon Hee-jin.

50
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,443
She's the chairman's daughter, right?

51
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,987
She's married to Park Ki-se.

52
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,156
You knew?

53
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,910
I was working here when they got married.

54
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,621
How could I not know?

55
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,833
It's all everyone was talking about.

56
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,960
This doesn't have to change anything.

57
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,045
She's still just my friend--

58
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,213
I…

59
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,424
have to go to the bathroom.

60
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,521
EPISODE 9
I REGRET IT

61
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,697
That is some coincidence.

62
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:48,955
ONG-JU

63
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,291
ONG-JU, HER MAJESTY

64
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,841
It's all in the past.

65
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,428
I just need to keep my mouth shut.

66
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,113
This is a problem.

67
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,033
Now I can always tell when you're lying.

68
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,161
I wasn't lying.

69
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,455
I really was going to the bathroom.

70
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,123
I just…

71
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,042
had to stretch first.

72
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,966
High fructose corn syrup
helps produce serotonin,

73
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,759
which makes you feel happy.

74
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,135
When I don't know what's going on

75
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,096
and don't have the words to comfort you,

76
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,849
all I can do is provide
chemical assistance.

77
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,353
Why are you smiling?

78
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,982
I'm trying my best to keep it inside.

79
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,316
"Hey, everyone."

80
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,069
"So Baek-ho is such a softie sweetie."

81
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,028
All right.

82
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,907
Don't worry.

83
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,869
There's nothing going on.

84
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,913
Some bad memories
just came rushing back.

85
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,793
I'll crush them with
the power of a blood sugar spike.

86
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,922
Mi-kyung.

87
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,594
I know that I seem cold and indifferent,

88
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,180
which makes it hard for you

89
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,349
to open up to me.

90
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,311
But to me, you're an exception.

91
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,316
You can tell me anything at any time.

92
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,735
I hope you know that.

93
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,074
Can I really tell you everything?

94
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,549
That's my secret.

95
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,136
Let's get back to work.

96
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,353
Did you lose weight?
You look even better now.

97
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,235
Why don't we go for a drive
like we used to?

98
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,988
We could use a change of scenery.

99
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,327
I get it. That might be difficult.

100
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,288
Then we could just grab coffee
at the place across the--

101
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,224
Can you please slow down?

102
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,892
I haven't worn heels in forever…

103
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,401
My feet hurt.

104
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,072
I'm sick of you acting this way.

105
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,450
You disappeared overnight.

106
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,744
In the past few years,
I've looked for you everywhere.

107
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,788
I swallowed my pride and asked around

108
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,040
just so I could find you.

109
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,918
Then you show up like nothing's happened…

110
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,171
and ask me to hug you.

111
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,340
You think you can treat people like this

112
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,342
just because you were born rich
and have it easy?

113
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,012
I stopped resenting you a long time ago.

114
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,138
I just…

115
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,932
want to know the reason…

116
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,101
why you left me like that.

117
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,521
If you got sick of playing house
or met someone else, just tell me.

118
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,274
Then I can finally let go…

119
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,152
of this awful relationship.

120
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,286
I'd rather you get mad.

121
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,040
It makes me sad to see you so calm.

122
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,253
Do you still think…

123
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,965
that I'm the one who ended our marriage?

124
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,093
-What do you mean?
-Get it right.

125
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,013
I didn't leave you.

126
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,224
You abandoned me.

127
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,686
I didn't get sick of our marriage.
I did my best to hold on…

128
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,231
until I gave up.

129
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,776
I don't understand--

130
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,195
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

131
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,406
You know whose fault it was.

132
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,242
If you want to keep pretending you don't,

133
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,244
go ahead.

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,123
Keep resenting me for leaving.

135
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,460
Keep playing the victim
and feeling sorry for yourself.

136
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,504
"This awful relationship"?

137
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,006
Don't let go.

138
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,634
I think you have
the wrong idea about this--

139
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,010
I want you…

140
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,638
to be miserable forever.

141
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,479
Hey…

142
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,314
Yoon Hee-jin!

143
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,745
This is your fault.

144
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,164
I'm still half asleep from listening
to your boring speech

145
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,791
at the meeting.

146
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,085
What do you want for dinner?

147
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,420
Let's see.

148
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,465
I feel like something spicy.

149
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,968
I'd also like to get some fresh air.

150
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,887
I know just the thing.

151
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,182
-Should we go?
-Let's go.

152
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,645
-Stop! Are you crazy?
-Don't fight it.

153
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,188
This is crazy.

154
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:54,445
LEFTOVER RAMYEON, CONTAINERS
AND CHOPSTICKS GO HERE

155
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,573
RAMYEON

156
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,579
Wow, that smells amazing!

157
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,122
Ramyeon at Hangang River.

158
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,667
Once you taste it, you'll never forget it.

159
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,503
Why doesn't ramyeon at home hit as hard?

160
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,639
You really are the best person
to go on a date with.

161
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,934
Look at how you're
making me talk to myself.

162
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,477
Sorry.

163
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,189
I've been paying attention the whole time.

164
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,066
But the ramyeon display
was all over the place.

165
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,818
I had to tidy it up.

166
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,699
Of course.

167
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,243
Have a fun date with the ramyeon stand.

168
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,870
Wait. Mi-kyung?

169
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,710
Wait for me, Mi-kyung!

170
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,629
Mi-kyung.

171
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,673
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,718
I won't get distracted anymore. I promise.

173
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,721
You promise?

174
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,766
Does that mean…

175
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,352
you'll be okay with that?

176
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,361
Of course.

177
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,741
Besides only having eyes for you,

178
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,493
my heart is also…

179
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,661
-Baek-ho.
-…only beating…

180
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,912
Yes?

181
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,372
Did you know?

182
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,667
That you're the weirdest person I know.

183
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,086
But I find it annoyingly cute.

184
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,139
I'll give you five minutes, and that's it.

185
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,935
Give me three. I'll be back
before the ramyeon gets cold.

186
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,687
Three minutes!

187
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,215
Darn it.

188
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,928
What?

189
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:28,516
It's my friend, So Baek-ho. Baek-ho!

190
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,024
So Baek-ho!

191
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,117
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,828
I get a snotty nose when I start crying.

193
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,289
This doesn't mean I have bad hygiene.

194
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,042
My hair got a deep shampoo this morning,

195
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,209
and I also flossed.

196
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,919
I see.

197
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,010
Drink this and sober up.
I'll call you a cab.

198
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,512
Are you going to send me home?

199
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,641
I feel so empty inside right now.

200
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,895
I need attention and affection
from someone so badly right now.

201
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,856
Just for a little while…

202
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,901
could you please take care of me?

203
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,697
She can join us. I don't mind.

204
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,032
I swear!

205
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:31,204
I'll keep it together
and I won't act all drunk.

206
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,415
Cut me some slack
just for tonight, will you?

207
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,722
Well, well.

208
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,100
Now I know…

209
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,228
that the person of interest was Mi-kyung.

210
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,482
No wonder. So Baek-ho has high standards.

211
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,443
You two are great together.

212
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,490
I give you my blessing!

213
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,537
May you live happily ever after.

214
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,456
It's been ten seconds
since you promised not to act drunk.

215
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,625
I'm not even acting drunk.

216
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,877
I'm just jealous.

217
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:24,382
I envy your relationship.

218
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,394
When I think about it,
I was at my happiest six years ago.

219
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,817
The three of us had fun in New York.

220
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,696
We watched K-dramas together all the time

221
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,282
and made kimchi pancakes, you know?

222
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,702
I've tried to recreate them,
but they just didn't taste the same.

223
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,620
They weren't that good back then, either.

224
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,205
The good times made them taste better.

225
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,331
Have some.

226
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,125
Do you really think so?

227
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,629
Was it the good times
that made them better?

228
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,802
Did you guys first meet
during the training?

229
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,345
You and Mr. Park.

230
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,768
Gosh.

231
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,896
What?

232
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,440
Am I not allowed to ask about this?

233
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,441
It's okay.

234
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,610
There are plenty of other people

235
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,196
who want to hear about us.

236
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,240
The chairman's daughter
got married to a low-level employee.

237
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,328
It sounds like
there would be a story there.

238
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,246
But you know what?

239
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,626
Back then, we just had a pure romance.

240
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,256
I was so bored of studying abroad.

241
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,259
That's when I heard Baek-ho was
in New York on a company training program.

242
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,386
I was excited, so I ran to go see him.

243
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,766
But when I got to his place,
some attractive guy opened the door.

244
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,728
That was him.

245
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,814
It was love at first sight.

246
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,735
We'd take beach walks, go see musicals,

247
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,113
and take naps
lying on the grass at the park.

248
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,741
Every moment was dazzling.

249
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,077
Like a movie.

250
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,539
It sounds like you were really into him.

251
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,498
I was.

252
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,042
That's why I dropped out

253
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,419
and followed him
back to Korea to marry him.

254
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,133
He was so kind and mature.

255
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,471
You've only ever seen him at work,
so you probably can't even imagine

256
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,806
him being that way.

257
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,772
Gosh.

258
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,903
Why am I blabbering on about this
when you're on a date?

259
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,489
I must be really drunk.

260
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,033
I'll run to the bathroom

261
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,452
and splash some cold water on my face.

262
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,539
Go ahead and make out all you want.

263
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,966
Tell me if she's making you uncomfortable.

264
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,177
I can always put her in a cab
and send her to Ms. Yoon's place.

265
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:18,848
Mi-kyung?

266
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,862
Mi-kyung.

267
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,205
I was supposed to meet up with someone.

268
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,082
My friend must be furious.

269
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,001
I have to go.

270
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,341
When you're lying…

271
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,052
I should act like I don't notice, right?

272
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,556
Hee-jin seems to be going through a lot.
Make sure you take care of her.

273
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,643
I'll see you at the lab tomorrow, smiling.

274
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,210
LOOK AT HIM

275
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,045
WHY ON EARTH

276
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,463
WON'T HE

277
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,965
GO HOME?

278
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,092
I DON'T KNOW!

279
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,720
MR. BU

280
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,724
SAY SOMETHING TO HIM!

281
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,811
I ALSO

282
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,021
DON'T WANT TO RUB HIM THE WRONG WAY

283
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,107
I'M SCARED TOO

284
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,159
WHY

285
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,618
WON'T THEY JUST TEXT?

286
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,037
WHY ARE THEY PLAYING CHARADES?

287
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,166
I ALSO HAVEN'T

288
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,001
FIGURED THEM OUT

289
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,502
COMPLETELY

290
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,838
YET

291
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,849
Mom, I can't make it.

292
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,975
MOM
WHERE ARE YOU?

293
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,020
These people just won't go home.

294
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,606
I'm a section chief
from the Strategic Planning Department.

295
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,233
I'm here representing Wonhan Retail.

296
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,443
I'M AT PYEONGWON BUS STATION

297
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,362
I can't be the one to leave first.

298
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,615
I BROUGHT MIYEOKGUK
AND TTEOKGALBI FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY

299
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,742
Great work today, everyone!

300
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,871
It's getting late.
Everyone should go home.

301
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,790
No one's harvesting potatoes this late.

302
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,792
You're right.

303
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,502
Right.

304
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,761
I'm so used to working hard at corporate

305
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,055
that I lost track of time.

306
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,183
Great work, everyone.
I'm leaving for the day.

307
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,101
-Good night.
-Good night.

308
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,983
-Pack your things, everyone.
-Are we all leaving?

309
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,903
POTATO LAB

310
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,909
Mom!

311
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,389
Tell me when you arrive
at Pyeongwon Station.

312
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,640
I'll come pick you up.

313
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,837
You're back.

314
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,008
I'm packing my things and leaving.
Don't talk to me.

315
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:15,895
Hey.

316
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,397
Did you and Ong-ju have a fight?

317
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,651
What is it, then? Why are you crying?

318
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,031
Jeez.

319
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,867
I never told you not to tell me anything.

320
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,202
I asked you a question. You can answer.

321
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:35,748
Come on.

322
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,335
Who am I kidding? I don't need this.

323
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,337
Ong-ju…

324
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,797
ran away.

325
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,467
What?

326
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,261
Why would she do that?

327
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,805
You bastard.

328
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,600
Did you make her cry?

329
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,644
It's nothing like that.

330
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:03,776
She said she loves me,
but not as much as she loves you.

331
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,277
So…

332
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,738
she couldn't do anything
that would hurt you.

333
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,658
She wanted to end everything.

334
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,202
What are you talking about…

335
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,412
Hold on.

336
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,749
Do you guys say
"I love you" to each other?

337
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,126
Ong-ju really told you that she loves you?

338
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,753
She loves Kim Hwan-kyung? Seriously?

339
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,797
Of course. Why else would she be with me?

340
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,507
To make me clean her room?

341
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,304
Since when? Since when
have you loved each other?

342
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,931
You don't know anything.

343
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,767
I've been in love with Ong-ju
for a long time.

344
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,269
She's my first love.

345
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,146
No, she's not.

346
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,273
Don't you remember?

347
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,359
You were in middle school.

348
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,569
You got friend-zoned
and then dumped by your first love,

349
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,613
so you went on a hunger strike…

350
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,288
That was Ong-ju.

351
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,586
Ong-ju was your first love?

352
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,425
Have you been in love with her ever since?

353
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,136
How could I move on?

354
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,764
I could only think about her
even when I was dating other people.

355
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,850
Even when she hasn't showered in a week,

356
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,228
even when she's drooling
while sleeping on the couch,

357
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,231
no matter what she says or does to me,

358
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,775
it doesn't bother me.
How could I stop liking her?

359
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:33,115
You can be as comfortable as you want now.

360
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,494
Because Ong-ju and I are over,
just like you wanted.

361
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,674
Wow.

362
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,149
Hey, Kim Hwan-kyung!

363
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,779
Kim Hwan-kyung!

364
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,411
Come on.

365
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,955
Brush your teeth
and change into something else.

366
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,374
Why?

367
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,126
Why do you think?

368
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,463
You're getting your girlfriend back.
Is that how you want to look?

369
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,680
Mi-kyung.

370
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,498
Mi-kyung.

371
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,130
Hey, nice to see you again.

372
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,422
I'm kind of busy right now--

373
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,674
When did you come back?

374
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,301
Just now.

375
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,594
But I have to go somewhere--

376
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,179
You're mad at me, aren't you?

377
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,681
Sorry?

378
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,767
You were acting strange today,
and you never texted me back.

379
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,895
If I did something wrong, please tell me.

380
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,280
It's nothing like that.

381
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,199
I just wasn't feeling good today--

382
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,244
You keep doing this, and it's hurting me.

383
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,999
No, listen to me--

384
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,501
I really like you, so…

385
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,045
I want to know everything about you.

386
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,255
But I'm being patient.

387
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,301
Because I understand that you have secrets
you don't want to tell me.

388
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,219
Baek-ho.

389
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,679
Let's talk about this tomorrow--

390
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,806
But watching you push me away like this

391
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,100
-makes me feel--
-Look!

392
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,525
Hello.

393
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,944
I just wanted you to pick one for me.

394
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,990
-Left.
-Right.

395
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,097
Is this where Ong-ju's family lives?

396
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,515
Yes.

397
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,852
She's the only girl in a family of boys
and comes from a long line of teachers.

398
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,939
Although you'd never guess it
from all the freaky stuff she says.

399
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,775
Let's go.

400
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,321
-Come on.
-Wait.

401
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,281
Why did we bring him?
So he won't get upset?

402
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,951
Shut up and just get out.

403
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,188
She is one stubborn girl.

404
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,358
She still won't pick up.

405
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,278
The lights are off on both floors.
What do we do?

406
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,571
We should ring the doorbell first.

407
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,698
-Wait, no!
-No, don't!

408
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,908
Well…

409
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,705
The thing is, we can't
let her family know that we're here.

410
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,624
-Why not?
-Because…

411
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,795
Ong-ju's parents are huge fans of mine.

412
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,380
Too huge.

413
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,464
Hey, guys!

414
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,966
-One, two.
-One, two, ta-da!

415
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,302
MI-KYUNG

416
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,470
That's me!

417
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,640
In a way, her family
is like my own personal fan club.

418
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,476
If they see me,
we'll have to talk for hours.

419
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,979
Then they'll feed me since
I'll be hungry from all the yapping.

420
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,189
Once I'm full,
they'll want me to sleep over.

421
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,442
When I wake up, they'll make me breakfast.

422
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,360
Last year, when she visited
over the holidays,

423
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,862
she had eight meals in 22 hours.

424
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:22,988
That's right.

425
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,781
Is that humanly possible?

426
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,452
The point is, we can't
let them know we're here.

427
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,661
We won't be able to leave.

428
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,705
We have to sneak Ong-ju out
as quietly as possible.

429
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,333
How do we do this?

430
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,384
A little higher. Come on.

431
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,845
You used to climb over walls
to skip classes all the time!

432
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,096
Where did that talent go?

433
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,391
My joints aren't as young and healthy
as they were back then.

434
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,477
I should've worn more comfortable pants.

435
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,522
This won't work. Let me down.

436
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,483
I'll have to unbutton my pants first.

437
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,487
What are you doing? Let me down.

438
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,328
Who wants tanghulu?

439
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,957
Officer, please.

440
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,751
I always pay my taxes on time,

441
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,128
and I have a nearly perfect driving score.

442
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm not the type of person
to rob someone's house!

443
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,593
I'm sorry.

444
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,639
You're probably regretting tagging along
and getting into this mess.

445
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,057
I'm not.

446
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,768
I'm thinking about
how I could've persuaded those girls

447
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,561
not to report us.

448
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,646
What?

449
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,356
Why?

450
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,818
I have to review my past mistakes
to avoid repeating them.

451
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,695
Instead of offering tanghulu,

452
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,240
we should've offered encyclopedias
or online course vouchers.

453
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,492
That would've been more enticing to them.

454
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,204
What kind of weird student were you?

455
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,000
A student who focused on his studies
yet took breaks for cultural experiences,

456
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,504
enriching his knowledge
in a well-balanced way.

457
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,091
Wow, you don't know anything.

458
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,593
When you're that age,
eating snacks with friends

459
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,220
is the best thing in the world.

460
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,807
Ong-ju and I would always
eat ramyeon at the store

461
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,892
then eat gimbap between classes.

462
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,186
We'd also go to buffets
and have nine plates…

463
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,529
Gosh.

464
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,158
Ong-ju is in all of my memories.

465
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,078
Are you okay?

466
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,873
No, I'm not.

467
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,711
You know what kind of friend she is?

468
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,921
When my mom passed away,

469
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,800
Ong-ju cried harder than me,
her own daughter.

470
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,221
My great-aunt, who hadn't
seen me in over a decade,

471
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,600
called her "Mi-kyung" and gave her a hug.

472
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,021
That's what Ong-ju's like,

473
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,981
and I lashed out at her over nothing.

474
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,150
I pushed her away.

475
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,864
She must've felt so sad and hurt.

476
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,575
I feel really bad.

477
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,630
Ong-ju!

478
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,842
You psycho.

479
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,221
Who climbs up someone's wall
in the middle of the night?

480
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,180
What about you?

481
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,016
Who runs away just because
their friend yelled at them once?

482
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,852
Ong-ju, we have her blessing.

483
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,646
We can start again--

484
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,316
-I'm sorry, Mi-kyung.
-No, I'm sorry.

485
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,984
I tripped and fell.

486
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,278
I'm sorry even more.

487
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,534
I was being selfish.

488
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,962
-It's all my fault.
-No.

489
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,257
-I was only thinking about myself.
-Stop it.

490
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,728
SERVING WITH COMPASSION AND RELIABILITY

491
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,035
-Hold on, not yet.
-Sure.

492
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,546
Are we having spring rolls today?

493
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,505
Yes.

494
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,675
I didn't get any peanut sauce.
You're allergic.

495
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,179
These would look good on you.

496
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,139
They're cute.

497
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,682
We'll get these in 230.

498
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,394
Ta-da! It's past midnight.

499
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,314
Happy birthday, Princess!

500
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,326
Why did she have to show up
just then?

501
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,378
Gosh.

502
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,612
Honeybun, Ong-ju is up!

503
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,864
Why are you up so early? Did you miss me?

504
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:58,823
I did.

505
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,909
You haven't brushed your teeth yet.

506
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,410
No.

507
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,747
What?

508
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,666
What are you doing?

509
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,923
Do I have to sit through this nonsense
before I leave for work?

510
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,633
Lee Ong-ju, Kim Hwan-kyung.

511
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,093
Come and recite this.

512
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,354
Code of conduct, number one!

513
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,607
"Don't express love
in front of Kim Mi-kyung."

514
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,692
Two!

515
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,486
"Don't show your happiness
in front of Kim Mi-kyung."

516
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,445
Three!

517
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,532
"Physical contact is only allowed

518
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,826
between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays."

519
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,827
That's right.

520
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,996
I'm still in the same room as you.

521
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,998
Let's all try to behave, okay?

522
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,376
Man, just wait until you leave.

523
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,795
Hwan-kyung and I are going to--

524
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,046
Aren't you having breakfast?

525
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,923
I made sundubu-jjigae.

526
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,884
No, thanks. You two make me feel sick.

527
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,351
Come on! Can't you wait
a few seconds before the door closes?

528
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,769
Are you animals?

529
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,280
Jeez.

530
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,282
I should move to Alaska or something.

531
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,662
-Hello?
-It's me, Ki-se.

532
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,165
Do you have a minute?

533
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,084
Why do you ask?

534
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,211
I'm sure you want some answers.

535
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,589
I'm in Pyeongwon right now.

536
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,430
Over here.

537
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,698
What are you doing?

538
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,784
I was going to drink that. I'm thirsty.

539
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,996
I thought you were going to…

540
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,333
Why do you look so angry?

541
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,168
Jeez. Hey!

542
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,795
Imagine your ex-girlfriend telling you

543
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,256
to come to a coffee shop 20 minutes away
from the bus station in this weather.

544
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,257
You'd be angry, too.

545
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,683
Does Hee-jin know…

546
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,102
that I'm your ex?

547
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,479
No, she doesn't.

548
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,189
She doesn't know my ex's name or face

549
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,483
or that we used to work together.

550
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,568
I knew it.

551
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,947
That's why she's okay
with staying at our guesthouse.

552
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,658
If she knew and still chose to stay,
she'd be evil.

553
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,704
You've been calling me
and showing up at the guesthouse

554
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,498
because of her.

555
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,001
Were you nervous?

556
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,212
That I would say something

557
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,463
and your wife would find out?

558
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:01,840
It's nothing like that.

559
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,383
Then what is it?

560
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,468
Was it fun to watch?

561
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,181
The fact that I had a welcome party
for her without knowing who she was.

562
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,933
Laughing and having fun together.

563
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,853
I get it.

564
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,813
It must've been funny.

565
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,399
To see me act like a fool.

566
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,610
What should I have done?

567
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,280
"The woman that I cheated
on you with six years ago

568
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,739
is living next door to you."

569
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,907
Should I have said that?

570
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:28,992
You should have!

571
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,910
If you had told me from the start,

572
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,579
I wouldn't have felt this terrible

573
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,789
knowing that you've lied to me again.

574
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,335
I never lied. I didn't know.

575
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,964
Am I supposed to believe that right now?

576
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,758
You didn't know where she was staying?

577
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,135
You're her husband.

578
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,607
I couldn't get in touch with her.
How was I supposed to know?

579
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,558
I never even got to talk to her
before she divorced me.

580
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,101
How was I…

581
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,645
What?

582
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,774
It's been years already.

583
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,152
She just ran away out of the blue,

584
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,862
and I got a call from a lawyer.

585
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,907
I didn't even see her while
I was going through the legal process.

586
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,993
She never answered my calls or texts.

587
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,997
Our marriage ended just like that.
She never told me why.

588
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,125
But everyone at the company still thinks--

589
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,293
Ms. Wang's orders.

590
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,796
She said that I was the only one
who could guide her when she's lost…

591
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,966
That before I have
a real conversation with her,

592
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,469
I should keep the divorce a secret.

593
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,348
Wherever I go,

594
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,643
I tell people how
my non-existent wife is doing.

595
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,730
Every anniversary,
I bring home flowers for no one.

596
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,691
That's my life now.

597
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,819
It must make you happy.

598
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,823
It does.

599
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,202
It makes me very happy.

600
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,121
That's what you get.

601
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,084
Why are you such a loser, though?

602
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,878
Ms. Wang's orders or not,

603
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,089
you could just leave Wonhan and move on.

604
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:10,343
Why are you sticking around
and putting on a show for those people?

605
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,721
Is being the chairman's son-in-law
more important than living your life?

606
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,057
It's not that simple.

607
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,517
You're just scared.

608
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,437
Scared of starting over as just Park Ki-se
without the title of executive director.

609
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,565
Going back to the old Park Ki-se
who had nothing.

610
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,276
You just want to avoid that
because you're scared.

611
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,154
That's why you lie to yourself
and pretend like you have no choice.

612
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,034
One more thing.

613
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,495
You might've been worried I would go crazy

614
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,789
and do something drastic
after seeing you two yesterday.

615
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,418
But thankfully,
I now have the ability to tell

616
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,420
what's really important in my life.

617
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,757
You're a terrible mistake
I made in the past.

618
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,176
I won't just stand there like an idiot

619
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,429
and regret that mistake.

620
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,350
I hope you learn to do the same one day.

621
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,937
I'd be happy for you
from the bottom of my heart.

622
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,422
You should've at least been happy
after leaving me like that.

623
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,388
Just a second.

624
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,351
-Mr. Lee!
-Yes?

625
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:43,978
I'm not seeing things, am I?

626
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,980
Of course not.

627
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,857
Why is the greenhouse door open?

628
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,233
-What?
-Look!

629
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,361
-Hey, close that!
-Closing!

630
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,864
Closing it right now.

631
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,074
It's closed.

632
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,368
-What?
-No way.

633
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,717
Quick! We've been robbed!

634
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,427
What? We have?

635
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,721
-Where's the thief?
-We didn't see.

636
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,307
But all of the greenhouse doors were open.

637
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,018
That means it's not someone from the lab.

638
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,854
Of course not. No one who works here

639
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,607
would be stupid enough
to leave the greenhouse doors open.

640
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,193
We weren't told
someone would be visiting today.

641
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,238
That means someone broke in!

642
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,242
Is that such a big problem?

643
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,451
Sorry?

644
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,498
Was it you that left the doors open?

645
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,666
Yes.

646
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,043
I think I forgot
after taking a look around earlier.

647
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,545
"Earlier"?

648
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,005
That means they've been open for hours--

649
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,259
Who told you it was okay to go in?
Do you know how important they are?

650
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,428
We keep them double-locked
to keep viruses from coming in.

651
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,515
If the crops in there catch anything--

652
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,308
Then you could just grow more.

653
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,643
They're just potatoes.

654
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,727
It's not a big deal.

655
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:11,983
THEY'RE JUST POTATOES

656
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,529
I'll be more careful from now on.

657
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,281
I'm leaving for the day.

658
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,300
Wait.

659
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,759
Someone stop her.

660
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,219
-What's going on?
-Stop her.

661
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,262
Ms. Ju!

662
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,597
-Ms. Ju!
-Ms. Ju!

663
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,894
What are you doing? What is that?

664
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,145
What's going on?

665
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,606
Ms. Ju!

666
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,693
-Wait a second!
-Calm down!

667
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,695
-What are you doing?
-Wait!

668
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,113
Stop her.

669
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,323
Stop!

670
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,376
-"Ah."
-"Ah."

671
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,503
Do you like it?

672
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,381
Are you coming from another run?

673
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,717
-Here. Have some.
-Here.

674
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,801
We made gimbap.

675
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,345
There's cheese and tuna.

676
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,512
No, thank you.

677
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,182
To avoid blood sugar spikes,

678
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,684
I regularly have my HbA1C checked.

679
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,686
I see.

680
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,396
Hb… what?

681
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,232
I'm scared.

682
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,734
By the way, is Mi-kyung not home yet?

683
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,486
It seems like she'll be working late.

684
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,155
She's taking care of something
that a "Mr. Lee" messed up.

685
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,907
-She is?
-What did she say?

686
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,788
I'll censor profanity.

687
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,000
"Mr. Lee, that dumb-dumb."

688
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,128
"That mentally ill baby animal."

689
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,923
"He has a pure and clean brain."

690
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,468
"I want to make him go 'owie.'"

691
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,222
I see.

692
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,053
I smell something fried.

693
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,138
Seaweed rolls?

694
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,599
Calamari?

695
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,642
Is this a dream?

696
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,772
What's keeping you here so late?

697
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,732
Hey.

698
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,859
You scared me.

699
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,111
Guess I wasn't dreaming.

700
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:49,575
There was an incident
with the greenhouses earlier.

701
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,535
I have to check for aphids

702
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,371
in every single one of the 40,000 samples.

703
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,916
Thanks.

704
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,001
This is urgent, right? I'll help.

705
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,461
No need.

706
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,588
The bugs are so little
you can barely see them.

707
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,299
You have to look for them closely.

708
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,510
I can't trust a novice with that.

709
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,554
By the way,

710
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,474
when is Mr. Lee going back to corporate?

711
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,353
I was already annoyed by him
making our staff

712
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,771
do his busy work.

713
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:19,897
You know what he said?

714
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,607
"They're just potatoes."

715
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,194
There are two ways to solve this.
The first one is the standard way.

716
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,197
Be patient until
his dispatch order expires.

717
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,700
Here's the other way.

718
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:36,372
Well, this is a bit low.

719
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,834
I love taking the low road.

720
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,585
Tell me. What is it?

721
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,338
Abusing your boyfriend's power.

722
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,637
The latter is kind of dishonorable, right?

723
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,639
I take it back.

724
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,807
Wait.

725
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,934
That's not the problem.

726
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:02,231
Are you… my boyfriend?

727
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,694
I never agreed to that.

728
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,073
Well…

729
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,577
That's…

730
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,538
I mean…

731
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,206
I'm sorry.

732
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,042
I got excited and prematurely
defined our relationship…

733
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,717
Were you joking?

734
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,386
Dating a younger guy is so much fun.

735
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,263
Your face just turned beet red.

736
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,599
I'm only two years younger.
We're practically the same age.

737
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,101
It may only be two years,
but you are younger.

738
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,854
If you don't like it,
you should have been born earlier.

739
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,775
Anyway, I'll deal with this,

740
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:50,905
and then I'll deal with Mr. Lee
the Kim Mi-kyung way.

741
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,990
It's time for the children to go to bed.

742
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,408
"Children"?

743
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,829
Also, if you want to be my boyfriend,

744
00:49:58,913 --> 00:49:59,830
ask me first.

745
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,834
Officially, the standard way.

746
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,762
Here's your tteokbokki.

747
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,725
How adorable.

748
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,498
You're here early, Ms. Kim.

749
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,502
No. I never left.

750
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,004
I had to check on
the potatoes in the greenhouse.

751
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,092
Well, good job.

752
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,887
You can go back to work.

753
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,474
I have a favor to ask, Mr. Lee.

754
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:07,982
Here you go.

755
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,113
-Thank you.
-Not a problem at all.

756
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,741
Did you get any sleep?

757
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,120
Just a wink.

758
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,706
Maybe that's why…

759
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,833
nothing scares me right now.

760
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,211
-Sorry?
-Mr. Lee.

761
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,256
They say that the person
you should fear the most

762
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,633
is someone who has no future.

763
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,760
I guess.

764
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,178
I don't know if you've heard.

765
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,264
I'm…

766
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,601
getting fired soon.

767
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,025
I was watching the sun come up
at the lab this morning

768
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,860
when something occurred to me.

769
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,948
I have no future in this company.

770
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,200
I could be obedient

771
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,620
and be gently laid off
a few weeks from now,

772
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,748
or I could do something insane
and get fired today.

773
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,791
There would be little to no difference.

774
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,421
But the latter would feel so much better.

775
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,926
By the way, do you see that behind you?

776
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,137
The dent right there.

777
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:25,809
It's a fun coincidence that it's placed…

778
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,105
right where my forehead is.

779
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,193
You made that with your forehead…

780
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,236
I know.

781
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,616
So let's both be smart

782
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,370
and keep the peace
by minding our own business

783
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,289
so neither of us
has to see each other in court.

784
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,415
All right?

785
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,958
-Yes.
-Okay.

786
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,128
MK! What are you doing back there?

787
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,254
Hey!

788
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,592
I'm having a little chat with Mr. Lee.

789
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,219
Smile.

790
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,931
Yikes.

791
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,642
It's settled.

792
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,768
It is?

793
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,021
-Mi-kyung…
-Yes.

794
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,858
…won.

795
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,529
Wow, nice.

796
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:42,469
What is this? The back of a troubled man?

797
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,722
Well…

798
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,432
It's nothing.

799
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,852
I have a knack for picking up on things.

800
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,063
You're here on your way to work,
which means it's an urgent matter.

801
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,815
Mi-kyung stayed at the lab all night,

802
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,191
so you're not here for her.

803
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,444
Having an intelligent conversation
with Hwan-kyung

804
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,237
is impossible, and you know that.

805
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,241
That just leaves
the all-knowing genius, Lee Ong-ju.

806
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,745
That was surprisingly accurate.

807
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:11,832
I'm so cute
that people forget how insightful I am.

808
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,710
So, how can I help you?

809
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,129
Well…

810
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,923
I need to ask
for your advice on something.

811
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:25,554
Before I do,

812
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,223
I need to ensure this remains between us.

813
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,017
And if it doesn't? Will you sue me?

814
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,518
I'll be disappointed.

815
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,981
That's a fair price.

816
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,317
Okay, start!

817
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,034
Ms. Kim!

818
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,787
Your phone has been ringing like crazy.
You should check it.

819
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,954
-Has it?
-Yes.

820
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,672
What?

821
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:02,966
What?

822
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,636
What are you doing?

823
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,056
Get in. We have somewhere to go.

824
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,182
During work hours?

825
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,060
I have the afternoon off, and so do you.

826
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,229
You used my precious half-day?

827
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,396
Please, get in.

828
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,233
Where are we going?

829
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,484
Watch your step.

830
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,610
Okay.

831
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,581
It's crazy that you brought me here.

832
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,459
This is my favorite time of year
to come here.

833
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,796
I feel like all the potatoes I grew
and spread all over the world

834
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,048
have survived all of the rainstorms

835
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,591
and are waving at me,

836
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,094
saying that they're doing great.

837
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,014
I get what you mean.
It does feel like they're waving at us.

838
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,809
I didn't know it would be this beautiful.

839
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,396
You're not alone.

840
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,649
Potatoes are common.

841
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,819
You can see them anywhere,

842
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,445
so their hardship during growth

843
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:08,615
and the beauty they hold
when they're in full bloom

844
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,660
isn't something that people
know or care about.

845
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,580
I know now.

846
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,707
Thanks to you.

847
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:26,466
Is it because you saw this every year

848
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,927
that you started to like potatoes?

849
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,943
Baek-ho, I'm…

850
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,071
not the most open person.

851
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:50,574
Gosh.

852
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,661
I want to tell you everything, though.

853
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,748
But I don't know how you'd react,

854
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,085
and I'm scared that I might
break down just talking about it.

855
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,880
So I've been holding it back.

856
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,633
Can you understand that?

857
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,562
Something happened six years ago.

858
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,566
Back then, I thought my life was over.

859
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,861
I lost everything,
including my pride for my life's work

860
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,199
and my hopes for my future.

861
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,535
I just lived because I was still breathing

862
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:39,081
and only woke up in the morning
because I opened my eyes.

863
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,001
It was getting so bad

864
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:46,046
that I started looking for jobs
close to the guesthouse

865
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,090
and just applied for all of them.

866
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,427
But only one place wanted me.

867
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:54,972
That was the potato lab.

868
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,186
Chief Hong

869
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,106
hired me even though I had
no experience with potatoes.

870
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,524
Why do you think that was?

871
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,067
Why was it?

872
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,653
Because I seemed tough.

873
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,449
I'm serious.

874
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:18,620
Every time they hired someone,
they would always run away.

875
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:22,290
I guess they decided to hire someone
who would stick around and get trained.

876
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,461
But one week into the job,

877
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,047
I realized why everyone ran away.

878
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,802
Did you know that it snows
even in May in Daeseolryeong?

879
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,185
It snowed so much
that the greenhouses were destroyed.

880
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,398
So of course, everyone was shoveling snow.
It was a nightmare.

881
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,903
We put so much work into growing
those potatoes, but they all got buried.

882
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:55,824
Our goal was to save at least one.

883
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,660
But even after shoveling for days,

884
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,912
all we found were dead, frozen potatoes.

885
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,250
After a while, it was clear.

886
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,544
They were all dead.

887
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,590
They sprouted thinking
that spring had come,

888
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:15,052
but withered overnight
because of one snowstorm.

889
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,916
That's when I found it.

890
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,002
The potato of my destiny.

891
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,463
It was alive.

892
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,217
It was buried in the freezing snow

893
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,261
-without seeing sunlight for days.
-Mr. Hong!

894
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,846
Mr. Bu!

895
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,849
Everyone thought
that it would definitely be dead.

896
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,518
-Look at this.
-No way!

897
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,269
But it stayed persistent and survived.

898
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,146
-It's alive!
-My goodness.

899
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:09,981
Oh my!

900
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,193
I don't believe it.

901
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,903
At that moment…

902
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,491
I think that potato saved me.

903
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,829
I know this will sound crazy.

904
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,124
But right there…

905
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,544
I heard the potato talking to me.

906
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:33,839
"Hey."

907
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,634
"Even if the world falls apart,
you can live."

908
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:40,762
"So just live."

909
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,897
You don't believe me, do you?

910
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:51,857
That's okay.

911
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,859
If even Ong-ju doesn't believe that,

912
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:57,070
then it must sound insane to you.

913
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,032
No, I do believe you.

914
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,745
But I think…

915
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,582
that wasn't the potato talking to you.

916
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:12,252
It was you talking to yourself.

917
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,924
Deep down…

918
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,178
you've always had the strength
to get up on your own,

919
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:25,348
but you only realized it just then.

920
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,572
By the way, I have something
I want to tell you as well.

921
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,745
Hey…

922
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:52,000
To be honest, I think
I already know what it is.

923
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,131
Mi-kyung.

924
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,426
-Will you--
-Hold on! Wait a second.

925
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,304
No way. You can't do this!

926
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,139
This is too…

927
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,726
I like you too. A lot, actually.

928
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,312
But we're not there yet.

929
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,189
I'm not ready for this…

930
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,400
It's way too early for this, Baek-ho!

931
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,987
What do you think is going on?

932
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,113
What?

933
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,491
Weren't you going to…

934
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:26,743
propose… to me?

935
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,204
Isn't that what you're doing?

936
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,085
You once mentioned

937
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,171
that even if I got down on one knee,
you'd barely agree to date me.

938
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,216
So that's exactly
what I'm doing right now.

939
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,636
I see.

940
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,014
Did I say that?

941
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,979
Still, you can't just
get down on one knee like that.

942
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,274
You have a track record, you know?

943
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:00,068
You asked me out after one drunken kiss.

944
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,861
Who knows what you're going to say next?

945
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,447
I should be scared.

946
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,032
Then I won't say anything.

947
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,225
Kim Mi-kyung! What happened today?

948
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,895
-Jeez.
-Tell me everything.

949
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,730
Don't leave a single thing out.

950
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,858
Do you hear me?

951
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,485
Come on! What happened?

952
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:48,820
He finally asked you, didn't he?

953
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,947
Are you guys together now? Are you?

954
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,825
I have crazy strength right now
because I'm high on dopamine!

955
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,618
I'm going to break this door down!

956
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,246
All right! There!

957
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,206
Hey.

958
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,250
What did he say?
"I like you"? "I love you"?

959
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,209
What did you say?

960
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,711
"I like you"? "I love you"?

961
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,130
No! I mean…

962
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:08,923
we…

963
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:11,468
didn't use our words.

964
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,639
Oh my gosh!

965
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,475
Hey, don't make plans for this weekend.

966
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,726
We're looking for a venue.

967
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,811
With a great buffet
and enough parking space.

968
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,397
Stop getting ahead of yourself.
We're not looking for a venue.

969
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,691
Where should you go on your honeymoon?

970
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,652
If we start planning now,
you can have your wedding in May.

971
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,405
How about Europe?

972
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,990
That's when flights are the cheapest!

973
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,992
I'm not going to Europe!

974
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,619
Well, I…

975
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,874
would prefer a classic beach vacation.

976
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,709
So I can take a dip and eat seafood!

977
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,961
Yes! That sounds amazing!

978
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:50,006
You can eat king crab and go snorkeling!

979
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,803
Oh my gosh! Mi-kyung!

980
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,602
What did he do to the women in this house?

981
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,729
-Oh my gosh!
-Oh my gosh!

982
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,205
FALSE GOAT'S BEARD

983
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,757
IT IS WITH SADNESS THAT WE ANNOUNCE
THE PASSING OF PARK YOON-JE

984
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,970
BEREAVED: PARK KI-SE, PARK KI-YOUNG

985
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:29,272
GONGMO FUNERAL HOME

986
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,581
INCOMING CALL
DAD

987
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,798
No need to be polite.
You can go take your call.

988
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,884
It's just a spam call.

989
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,637
Hee-jin and I were thinking about
taking you to Hawaii

990
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,805
this Parents' Day. What do you think?

991
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,223
That sounds great.

992
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:08,311
Wow, you're a better son

993
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,563
than I could ever ask for.

994
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,462
Hey.

995
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,591
How did you know?

996
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,387
I got a text.

997
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,475
I just came to say goodbye to your dad.

998
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:53,064
If it makes you uncomfortable,
I'll just leave after giving a donation.

999
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,318
Not at all. Let's go inside.

1000
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,820
Mi-kyung, I can't believe you came.

1001
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,197
How are you doing?

1002
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:44,949
Are you well?

1003
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,244
Yes, I'm doing okay.

1004
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:55,168
You've lost a lot of weight.

1005
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,921
I told you not to skip meals
even if your stomach feels upset.

1006
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,883
How could I feel well?

1007
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,178
When I think about you…

1008
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,638
I feel guilty…

1009
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:09,640
and heartbroken.

1010
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:10,933
You don't have to.

1011
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,561
I was always grateful to you.

1012
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,316
You guys gave me so much.

1013
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,068
I owe you a great deal.

1014
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,948
Thank you.

1015
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:35,541
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

1016
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:39,712
Thanks for coming.

1017
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,674
My dad would talk about you
from time to time.

1018
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,219
He'd be glad that you're here.

1019
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,597
I'm happy to hear that.

1020
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,351
Make sure your mom
doesn't skip her meals.

1021
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,561
She's already so frail.

1022
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:57,772
You're right. I should.

1023
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,862
I'll be going now. I have to get to work.

1024
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:08,157
Are you leaving already? Have some more.

1025
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:11,369
I'm okay. Besides,
I'm allergic to peanuts.

1026
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,374
Take care of yourself.

1027
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,044
Let me know if you need my help.

1028
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,005
-Thanks.
-Bye.

1029
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,231
I didn't get any peanut sauce.
You're allergic.

1030
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,069
I love peanuts.

1031
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,363
-We'll get these in 230.
-Sure.

1032
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:50,157
No, we'll get them in 240.

1033
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,827
Happy birthday, Princess!

1034
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,377
Since when has my birthday been in May?

1035
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,420
What?

1036
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,259
You know who ruined our marriage!

1037
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:15,850
Did you really marry me
because you love me?

1038
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,103
Hee-jin.

1039
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,939
I've had a long day.

1040
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,692
Can we not do this?

1041
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,194
Do you think
I'm losing my mind over nothing?

1042
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,364
When I found this hidden in the closet?

1043
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,325
A LUCKY CHARM
LET'S BE HAPPY TOGETHER!

1044
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,911
I'm over it.

1045
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,248
She bawled her eyes out,
but I abandoned her.

1046
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,628
I even abandoned
my own conscience to be with you.

1047
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,217
And you're upset over one little note.

1048
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,932
I know you regret it.

1049
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:00,895
You regret leaving her.

1050
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:07,944
Mi-kyung!

1051
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,054
I regret it.

1052
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,397
Mi-kyung, I…

1053
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:49,777
regret it.

1054
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,790
Interesting.

1055
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,085
You're planning on asking
Mi-kyung to be your girlfriend?

1056
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:49,045
Yes.

1057
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,047
It's still just a rough idea,
but maybe I could

1058
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,674
take her to see
the potato blossoms that she likes--

1059
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,593
What? No! What are you thinking?

1060
01:15:56,427 --> 01:16:00,056
Mi-kyung isn't sentimental like that.

1061
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:03,434
You need a tangible gift,
not an emotional one.

1062
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,436
Something she can hold in her hands.

1063
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:06,771
You're missing that kick.

1064
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,939
-A "kick."
-Stay right here.

1065
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,031
TAMING THE HOT DIRECTOR

1066
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,326
What kind of book is this?

1067
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,288
A book that holds the key

1068
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,624
to Mi-kyung's heart.

1069
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,251
Open the first page.

1070
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,212
The answer is in there.

1071
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,263
"In the hot, steamy bathroom…

01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,853
was brushed by pale fingers…"

1074
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:52,066
You can return the favor
in the form of cash or jewelry.

1075
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:35,985
I have absolutely no idea
how to let go when I actually lose

1076
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:37,778
something precious to me.

1077
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,197
I'm happy…

1078
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,324
because of you, Baek-ho.

1079
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,285
The Research Team is having

1080
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,176
-a picnic tomorrow.
-Let's eat and play!

1081
01:17:46,301 --> 01:17:49,290
That auntie and uncle
were lying down together--

1082
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,749
Oh, dear.

1083
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,919
You're the one who proposed
a method and carried it out.

1084
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,921
Did Baek-ho not say anything to you?

1085
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,632
The person you like, Mi-kyung…

1086
01:17:58,716 --> 01:17:59,633
No.

1087
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,428
I can't believe this.

1088
01:18:08,209 --> 01:18:10,209
