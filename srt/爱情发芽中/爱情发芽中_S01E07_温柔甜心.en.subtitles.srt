00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,955
THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,292
A line I want to cross.

3
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,368
Wait.

4
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,162
Give me five minutes.

5
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,498
One minute.

6
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,835
Excuse me.

7
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,349
What was that?

8
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,150
Lee Ong-ju!

9
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,738
"A line…"

10
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,906
"A line you want to cross."

11
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,658
-What does that mean?
-What?

12
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,244
Hurry up and answer me!
"A line you want to cross."

13
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,664
"A line"?

14
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,168
There's only one line
you can cross in this country.

15
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,174
-Is somebody going to the North?
-Come on!

16
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,217
Oh, for Pete's sake!

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,471
What's up with her?

18
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,490
-Ms. Kim.
-What does that mean?

19
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,169
I mean…

20
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,214
I'm not someone you like
or find attractive.

21
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,008
But it would have been nice to hear,
"I've been thinking about you."

22
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,052
"A line…"

23
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,221
What line do you want to cross?

24
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,265
Do you think I'm that easy
just because I kissed you first?

25
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,101
You just want to sleep with me, right?

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,522
What? Why are you smiling?

27
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,608
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,111
That was not what I meant.

29
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,947
Then what is it?
What line is there to cross between us?

30
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,870
Ms. Kim, I…

31
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,125
remember the moment I was abandoned.

32
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,673
I'm not trying to use
my past as an excuse.

33
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,759
Or maybe I am, but only up to a point.

34
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,930
I just want to be open about how I feel.

35
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,313
I don't think of it as an excuse.

36
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,523
Speak your piece.

37
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,117
It was in the middle of a train station.

38
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,287
I thought my hand had slipped from hers,

39
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,124
but my mom never came back,
no matter how long I waited.

40
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,127
After I was sent to an orphanage,

41
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,045
my entire childhood

42
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,799
was about learning rules
and repressing emotions.

43
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,469
I no longer had a family to care for me

44
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,639
or a home to go back to.
The process of accepting that fact

45
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,853
was confusing and infuriating.

46
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,523
Once I realized that I was all alone,

47
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,694
I decided to do something
instead of just sitting around crying.

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,864
I drew my own lines and set standards.

49
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,201
As I sorted out right and wrong answers,

50
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,203
the world finally made sense to me.

51
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,498
My principles were a wall I put up,

52
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,334
and I've lived my whole life
according to them.

53
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,963
I took pride in my unwavering resolve
no matter the situation.

54
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,841
I trusted that my choices were flawless.

55
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,136
But lately…

56
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,936
I often lose my composure
and forget what I have to do.

57
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,980
I almost don't recognize myself.

58
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,486
Because of me?

59
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,696
Because of my feelings for you.

60
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,802
I'm sorry if I've confused you.

61
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,012
The way I've been behaving
is undoubtedly to blame.

62
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,347
From now on…

63
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:52,936
-From now on--
-Hey.

64
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,646
What's wrong with you?

65
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,567
What do you mean, "From now on"?

66
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,152
Why do you talk like it's already over?

67
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,572
Ms. Kim.

68
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,491
-I actually--
-I know.

69
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,536
I know you've submitted a report
regarding my termination.

70
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,162
I'm here anyway.

71
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,165
I'm standing here
because I don't care about that.

72
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,752
What?

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,256
Do you think you're the only one
who's confused?

74
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,260
What woman would be crazy enough
to fall for a man who's firing her?

75
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,511
Right?

76
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,015
But I am that woman.

77
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,269
I told myself that
if I ever dated a coworker again,

78
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,147
I'd change my name
from Kim Mi-kyung to Dog Mi-kyung.

79
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,566
But now I want to be Dog Mi-kyung.

80
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,905
I flip-flop twelve times a day
like a crazy person,

81
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,116
but it doesn't change the way I feel.

82
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,369
It hurts my pride
and it's so annoying, but still!

83
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,502
Anyway…

84
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,339
I understand how you feel.

85
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,133
Simply put…

86
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,135
you're drowning in my charm,

87
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,555
losing your judgment
and ability to focus on work.

88
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,267
Well…

89
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,311
Yes, actually.

90
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,396
To sum it up, yes.

91
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,899
Okay.

92
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,110
You can focus on work as usual
without crossing any lines.

93
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,197
During the time I have left,
I'll also be focusing on work.

94
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,741
But once I'm unemployed,

95
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,994
and you become just…

96
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,039
the guy next door,

97
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,708
let's see if you're still interested.

98
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,212
Then we can officially
start dating or whatever.

99
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,422
I…

100
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,427
knew how much this job meant to you,

101
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,430
but I still decided to let you go.

102
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,142
Aren't you bitter about it?

103
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,772
I am. I resent you.

104
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,984
So I decided to keep you close
and constantly bully you.

105
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,990
What?

106
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,617
Hey, I didn't say I'd date you right now.

107
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,999
It's okay for two coworkers
to shake hands, right?

108
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,835
I want us to keep work
and private life separate.

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,251
Oh.

110
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,713
I guess…

111
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,591
it's not okay.

112
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,094
Oh, I see.

113
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,763
Well, yes.

114
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,223
I don't think we should touch each other.

115
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,477
That sounded weird.
I meant that our skin shouldn't touch…

116
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,770
I mean…

117
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,480
Over there!

118
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,192
Wait…

119
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:56,638
EPISODE 7
SOFTIE SWEETIE

120
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,230
JULY

121
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,358
Hide the A/C remote in the Chief's office.

122
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,443
Take the staples
out of So Baek-ho's stapler.

123
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,112
Hit him and say it was an accident.

124
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,905
If possible, destroy his car.

125
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,490
Scoff at him every time he passes by.

126
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,242
Swear, then pretend
it wasn't meant for him.

127
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,868
SELECT ALL

128
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,288
MEMO

129
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,652
"A line"?

130
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,321
"A line you want to cross"?

131
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,450
Oh my gosh!

132
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,745
Kim Mi-kyung!

133
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,497
Kyung-mi!

134
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,543
Kim Mi-kyung!

135
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,837
What?

136
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,298
Hey!

137
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,180
I see.

138
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,642
You want to play this game?

139
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,078
What was that?

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,084
What was that noise?

141
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:51,920
What?

142
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,900
Jeez, Lee Ong-ju.

143
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,944
I almost had a heart attack.

144
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,738
Oh my gosh. That lunatic.

145
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,450
A door is no match for me.

146
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,827
Are you serious?

147
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,539
Did you seriously climb up the wall
just to mess with me?

148
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,918
As a Homo sapiens,
one of the advantages I have

149
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,169
is the use of tools.

150
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,463
For example, a ladder.

151
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,427
Now tell me. "A line I want to cross."

152
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,595
Who said that?

153
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,891
Jeez.

154
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,731
You know you're not going
back to sleep until you tell me.

155
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,777
Who do you think?

156
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,445
It was So Baek-ho.

157
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,494
Gosh.

158
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,162
Go ahead and overreact.

159
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,123
I'll be annoyed and then go to sleep.

160
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,085
Is this real? Do you really like him?

161
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,587
What if I do?

162
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,172
Relax, I'm keeping my clothes on.

163
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,886
Don't date him.

164
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,599
What?

165
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,436
Are you really dating a coworker again
after what you've been through?

166
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,604
What are you gonna do
if it doesn't end well?

167
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,315
Last time, you ran away to Gangwon-do.

168
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,607
What's next? Jeju Island?

169
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,068
Are you going to abandon
your job and friends again?

170
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,111
No way.

171
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,700
Lee Ong-ju, what's gotten into you?

172
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,870
Last time I checked,
you were writing romance novels about us.

173
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,289
You're so closed off.

174
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,666
I just wanted you to have some fun
with a good-looking guy.

175
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,044
I never wanted you to fall in love.

176
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,213
I don't trust him enough
for you to commit your future to him.

177
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,299
"Commit my future"?

178
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,550
It's too soon--

179
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,427
You're self-sacrificial in love.

180
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,055
You're happy to just get a hair clip
for your anniversary.

181
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,224
You believe every stupid line
that cheating jerks feed you.

182
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,685
You can't let go of a dead relationship.

183
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,146
You're a doormat and a fool.

184
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,981
Who knows what will happen?

185
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,612
I won't this time.

186
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,738
Heck.

187
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,657
-Hey.
-Yes?

188
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,202
You didn't fall

189
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,163
for his charming words, did you?

190
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,208
Experienced guys do that. He's slowly
cooking you until you do what he wants.

191
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,335
He's pretending to be
shy and inexperienced, right?

192
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,004
That's an act he's putting on
to cook you like a braised fish.

193
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,381
Open your eyes!

194
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,260
Braised monkfish this weekend?

195
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,013
Yes! That was all I could think of.

196
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,349
Let's go as soon as we get up.

197
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,017
Make a reservation for noon on Saturday.

198
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,311
Add fish intestines and squid.
Spice level three, okay?

199
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,105
-Okay.
-Sounds great.

200
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,857
Damn it. Anyway…

201
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,110
So what do you think?

202
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,487
Do you think you can trust him?

203
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,282
Well…

204
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,369
he was honest about his feelings.

205
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,913
I trust those feelings.

206
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,418
Tell me right away
if it seems like he's up to something.

207
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,169
If something feels off, smells fishy,

208
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,463
or if he gets a bored look
in his eyes, tell me.

209
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm going to break
all of his fingers and toes.

210
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,011
All right. I'll tell you.

211
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:29,971
Okay.

212
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,932
We should go shopping, too.

213
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:33,891
What for?

214
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,562
We need to get you new bras and panties.

215
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,439
If he sees those rags you have on,

216
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,441
he'll lose feelings for you so fast.

217
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,235
Why? This is still perfectly stretchy.

218
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,947
Oh my gosh, Ong-ju! Are you okay…

219
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,283
Are you alive?

220
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,141
Pow!

221
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,192
Neck-slice!

222
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,320
Hello.

223
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,446
Egg-kick!

224
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,949
Double egg-kick!

225
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,037
Tornado palm blast!

226
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,219
What are you looking at?

227
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,803
Is there something important to check?

228
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,597
-A Rural News article.
-A Rural News article.

229
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,182

00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,601
-The antiviral drug for PVY.

231
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,395

-Dihydroartemisinin was developed.

232
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,438
That's right.

233
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,816
What's going on with you guys?

234
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,236
It's been years since that was developed.

235
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,278
Right.

236
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,156
Hey, what time were you born?

237
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,115
Me?

238
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,078
My dad told me that he ran
to the hospital from a work dinner.

239
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,748
So I think I was born around 8:10 p.m.

240
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,958
Why do you ask?

241
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,709
It's nothing.

242

SO BAEK-HO

245
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,262
I was wondering…

246
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,682
You don't happen to know
the time Chief So was born,

247
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,933
do you?

248
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,603
What?

249
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,772
How would I know…

250
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,819
-Why? What are you doing?
-It's nothing.

251
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,365
Don't pay attention to them.
They're just wasting time.

252
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,493
Did you turn in
the growth report for Maroo?

253
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,995
Yes, I turned it in already.

254
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,746
Does he still want to go with Marshall?

255
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,250
He hasn't gotten back to me yet.

256
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:09,672
Then could you please go and ask him?

257
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,675
This waiting is eating me up inside.

258
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,306
-I will.
-Thanks.

00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,310

00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,026
Do we have to keep playing dumb?

264
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,902
All this lying is driving me crazy.

265
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,531
You play dumb half the time at work
and you play smart the other half.

266
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,783
It's lying 100% of the time.
Don't fight it.

267
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,827
Aren't you ashamed?

268
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,203
You're all researchers.

269
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,123
You should judge things based on facts,

270
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,585
not judge a relationship
based on compatibility tests.

271
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,087
This website is famously accurate.

272
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,965
I only had a compatibility score
of 16 with my ex,

273
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,634
and we broke up after a month.

274
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,677
Why'd you break up?

275
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,763
Because our compatibility score was 16.

276
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,058
You're real smart, aren't you?

277
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,064
So who's going to ask Chief So
about his birth time?

278
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,442
-Hee-dong.
-Me? I don't want to.

279
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,452
Because of my feelings for you.

280
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,589
CHIEF'S OFFICE

281
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,716
Shoot! Get it together.

282
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,886
Okay, think about things that annoy you.

283
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,139
Tongue sores, my salary, Kim Hwan-kyung.

284
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:46,560
That's right. Kim Hwan-kyung eating,
Kim Hwan-kyung sleeping…

285
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,273
Jeez, I can't contain myself.

286
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,694
If you're here to see me, come in.

287
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,754
Good morning, Chief So.

288
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,340
Good morning, Ms. Kim.

289
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:21,303
I wanted to ask you if you've read
the growth report for Maroo.

290
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,389
I haven't had the chance.

291
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,474
I'll let you know when I have.

292
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,810
Okay, thank you.

293
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,487
This might help you make a decision.

294
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,823
There's a disease
called the potato blight.

295
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,949
It plagues the crop.

296
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,368
You know about
the Great Famine in Ireland, right?

297
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,995
That was caused by the potato blight.

298
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,498
It advances quickly
and can even spread in stored potatoes.

299
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,542
It's a highly dangerous pathogen.

300
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,835
I read that Marshall

301
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,962
has a lower resistance
to this disease than Maroo.

302
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,922
Those weak little things.

303
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,550
How will they survive in Korean soil?

304
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,637
And what about resistance to scab?

305
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,723
Sorry?

306
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,516
You're talking about
resistance to disease,

307
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,478
but you're leaving out scab, which is odd.

308
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,687
From what I know,

309
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,939
scab notably decreases
the commercial value of potatoes,

310
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,191
forcing us to discard them.

311
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
Of the 16 diseases
that affect domestic potatoes,

312
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,820
scab is one of the most harmful.

313
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,782
And Marshall is more
resistant to scab than Maroo.

314
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,120
Of course, scab is scary, but--

315
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,164
It's more than just scary.

316
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,917
Symptoms of scab
don't appear above ground,

317
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,794
making it difficult to detect
during growth.

318
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,213
It spreads via soil,
so even without a host plant,

319
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,757
it can persist underground
for years before breaking out.

320
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,093
It easily spreads through rainwater,
irrigation water, wind, and humans,

321
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,429
while being extremely difficult to treat.

322
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,265
Chief So, I'm a researcher.

323
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,767
I'm aware of everything you said.

324
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,726
MARSHALL - MAROO

325
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,938
It's true that Marshall
is more resistant to scab than Maroo,

326
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,440
but I don't think it's a significant gap.

327
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,151
As for treating the disease,
we can adjust the pH levels with sulfur

328
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,778
and monitor the soil moisture level--

329
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,948
By that logic,
potato blight is also treatable.

330
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,701
Increasing the planting distance improves
the moisture level and ventilation,

331
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,246
and ridging sufficiently
delays physical contagion.

332
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,498
Selective fungicides
can be used for chemical control.

333
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,999
Is this not true?

334
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,968
Looks like you've been
studying your potatoes.

335
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,719
You're a real potato expert now.

336
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,014
To view the data objectively without
being influenced by the Research Team,

337
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,934
I thought I should have
some basic knowledge.

338
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,352
What do you mean…

339
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,729
How did we influence you?

340
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,148
Other than giving you
professional opinions as experts.

341
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,943
But at the same time, you're the ones
who developed the Maroo variety.

342
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,778
You can't help
but be biased in this matter.

343
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,573
That's why I included the data…

344
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:59,211
Were you offended
by the conversation we just had?

345
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:02,965
No.

346
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,385
I saw a whole new side of you
as a potato expert.

347
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,720
It almost makes me happy.

348
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,808
Anyway, I hope you'll review
Maroo's growth report soon.

349
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,742
He's still talking about Marshall
even after visiting Haeman…

350
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,749
No.

351
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,710
That's not So Baek-ho.

352
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,421
The So Baek-ho I like
and Chief So are different people.

353
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,923
Chief So is…

354
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,552
How dare he challenge me about potatoes?

355
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,726
Right.

356
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,063
This right here is a bit…

357
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,064
Hey, Ms. Kim.

358
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,151
You look upset.
Did Chief So say something?

359
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,152
No.

360
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,529
We had a perfectly
intellectual conversation.

361
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,033
Now I'm going to try
to shut his smart mouth.

362
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,209
Is that a lovers' quarrel?

363
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,419
It seems more like a street fight.

364
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,130
Unbelievable.

365
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,178
How dare he challenge me?

366
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,309
Okay.

367
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,245
JANG SEUL-GI
KIM MI-KYUNG

368
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,139
Okay.

369
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,665
V-48 Marshall.

370
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,419
I know, right?

371
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,298
Wow.

372
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,300
Kids usually like them grilled.

373
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,843
Where on earth is she?

374
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,721
Now, why would you
bring up potato ball soup?

375
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,681
Chief So! Come join us.

376
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,308
-Hello.
-Have some rice cakes.

377
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,018
I'm okay. Thank you for offering.

378
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,686
This was made today, so it's still warm.

379
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,271
Say "Ah." Just take a bite.

380
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,106
"Ah." That's right. Hand me some water.

381
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,691
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

382
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,109
-I'll get going. Enjoy.
-Wait.

383
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,319
-Thank you!
-All right.

384
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,362
No, you can't go there!
Go the other way!

385
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,364
-Okay.
-There are too many bugs there.

386
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,742
Watch your step. My goodness.

387
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,204
He's good-looking,
but not very steady on his feet.

388
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,244
Great! You're here.

389
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,246
Take a look at this.

390
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,833
This report covers Marshall’s growth
on the southern coast of China last year.

391
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,668
If you look at page three right here--

392
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,919
Ms. Kim.

393
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,257
I came in here…

394
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,343
to ask you out on a date.

395
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,261
Look at that. What did I tell you?

396
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,763
Chief So was looking anxious all day.

397
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,099
I knew they'd make up
before the day was over.

398
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,435
Chief So must really be into her.

399
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,687
He usually clocks out
at six o'clock sharp,

400
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,023
but he waited until Ms. Kim was done.

401
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,650
I have a question.

402
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,987
Why did we spend
over an hour on a stakeout?

403
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,865
Just so we could watch them
get in the same car?

404
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,330
That's it.

405
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,416
I need to date someone.
I don't care if it's an alien.

406
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,502
My wedding anniversary was today!

407
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,437
Is Korean fusion okay?

408
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,732
If you'd prefer something else--

409
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,276
That's okay. I like all kinds of food.

410
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,080
What do you enjoy doing
in your spare time?

411
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,831
My spare time?

412
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,334
Well…

413
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,544
Not much.

414
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,172
I'm usually passed out drunk,

415
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,634
at a public bath, or out hiking.

416
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,802
Right!

417
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,138
I have a secret hideout.

418
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,848
-A hideout?
-Yes.

419
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,435
I built a small greenhouse.

420
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,605
I grow potatoes there.
A variety of Maroo that I've developed.

421
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,031
Just to be clear,
that wasn't work-related.

422
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,492
I do that in my personal downtime.

423
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,912
I understand.

424
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,541
Hey.

425
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,794
Let me add one more thing
while I'm at it.

426
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,421
It's about the Marshall report.

427
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,464
There's one thing you overlooked.

428
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,050
Korea has a humid subtropical
and subhumid temperate climate.

429
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,427
Let me pull over.

430
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,446
So I was right. You were offended
by the Marshall-Maroo issue.

431
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,949
Not at all. That was work.

432
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,784
I wouldn't drag work into my private life.

433
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,369
Do you think I'm that petty?

434
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,914
Then why are you thinking
about something other than us right now?

435
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,375
I didn't. I'm thinking about you.

436
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,794
No, you're not.
You're thinking about potatoes.

437
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,677
Fine.

438
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,221
I'm thinking about potatoes.

439
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,641
How could I not?

440
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,145
You're saying that my baby
isn't as good as some other baby.

441
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,398
You can't look at it that way.

442
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,317
All I'm saying is…

443
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,779
I took a long and hard look
at those numbers you like so much,

444
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,448
but I just can't see
how Marshall is better.

445
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,492
It's better in some ways
but worse in others.

446
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,452
It's a very close game.

447
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,538
So shouldn't Maroo
at least get an ounce of advantage

448
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,916
for being developed by us in our lab?

449
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,504
This whole thing

450
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,049
might just be about
profit and numbers to you.

451
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,468
But for all of us in our lab,

452
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,179
it's about the time
and effort we've put in…

453
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,890
and our identities as potato researchers.

454
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,059
It feels like all of that is being erased.

455
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,395
Do you understand that?

456
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,319
I'm sorry it felt that way.

457
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,157
That's not what I…

458
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,246
I wasn't fishing for an apology.

459
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,832
Well…

460
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,051
Excuse me.

461
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,929
Ms. Kim.

462
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,359
I'm not mad.

463
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,987
I just don't think

464
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,656
I can have a good time
at dinner with you right now.

465
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:37,205
I'm going for a walk
to clear my mind, so you can go.

466
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,624
Your car will get towed
if you leave it like that.

467
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,709
I don't care.

468
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,004
What do you mean, "You don't care"?

469
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,550
I know I ruined your mood

470
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,595
by dragging work into our date
and picking a fight.

471
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,017
You didn't ruin my mood.

472
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,190
I'd rather you get mad.

473
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,525
Why are you so soft all of a sudden?

474
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,152
Jeez.

475
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,237
Are you some sort of softie sweetie?

476
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,323
I'll be a softie sweetie, then.

477
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,539
Gosh.

478
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,336
I'll give you ten seconds.

479
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,089
Take back what you said
about liking me and run away.

480
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,635
Dumping someone
for being a jerk on the first date

481
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,553
is totally reasonable.

482
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,263
How about this?

483
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,350
Don't think of this as our first date.

484
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,854
We were alone at the hospital
on the day we first met.

485
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,940
Let's count that as the first date.

486
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,358
The second date…

487
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,902
would be when you kissed me.

488
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,987
That wasn't a kiss. It was a peck.

489
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,614
All right, a peck.

490
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,242
I'd say that was a great second date.

491
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,160
If you think of it that way,

492
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:00,330
this would be about the fifteenth date.

493
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,582
Then it's perfectly natural
for us to fight.

494
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,129
Were you always this nice?

495
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,775
This means we made up.

496
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,471
I have something to confess.

497
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,394
I read the growth report for Maroo
as soon as I got it from you.

498
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,648
I've confirmed that it's
an excellent variety in many ways,

499
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,068
and it has an advantage
because it was made at the lab.

500
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,195
So I decided on using Maroo a while ago.

501
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,740
What?

502
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,658
What did you say?

503
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,577
Then why didn't you tell me?

504
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,371
Were you playing games with me?

505
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:24,914
No.

506
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,417
I wasn't sure yet.

507
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,295
If I had made a rational decision

508
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,381
or if I was taking the side
of someone I like.

509
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,635
You're joking!

510
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,178
I had no idea.

511
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,097
All day, I worked on this…

512
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,893
You can't take my side
when it comes to work.

513
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,026
I know, but I couldn't help myself.

514
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,403
Jeez.

515
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,114
This proves it.

516
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,034
You're officially a softie sweetie.

517
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,959
Can we do something else
instead of dinner?

518
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,339
There's somewhere I want to take you.

519
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,809
You're pretty.

520
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,812
No. You're prettier.

521
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,940
That's not true.
You're a thousand times prettier than me.

522
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,819
Then you're ten thousand times prettier.

523
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,654
Then you're a million times prettier.

524
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,115
That's enough.
There are only so many numbers.

525
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,828
Honeybun, here comes the airplane.

526
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,912
Say "Ah."

527
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,914
-Ah!
-Ah!

528
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,582
Isn't it cold because of the altitude?

529
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,292
I'm seriously fine.

530
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,711
One thing you should know is

531
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,713
that my body regulates
its temperature very well.

532
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,672
I'm not cold.

533
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,632
You're lying.

534
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,720
-We're here.
-Wow.

535
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,681
-Isn't it pretty?
-Yes, it really is.

536
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,891
What is all this?

537
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,104
Ms. Kim.

538
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,983
Was this your plan all along?

539
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,152
Were you trying to surprise me?

540
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,111
Sorry?

541
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,739
I had no idea.

542
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,075
Wow.

543
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,286
This place is beautiful.

544
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,748
-Why would they come here together?
-Be quiet.

545
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,718
This is your first letter to me.

546
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,763
Sorry?

547
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,696
Why? What is it?

548
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:05,950
Well…

549
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,494
I mean…

550
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,830
I have to…

551
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,334
I have to go.

552
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,419
This was fun.

553
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,338
Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

554
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,506
Where are you going…

555
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,467
What is going on?

556
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,469
GET EXCITED FOR TONIGHT

557
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,679
What?

558
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,727
What is this perverted crap?

559
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,648
Wait! Mr. So!

560
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,358
I didn't write that!

561
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,735
Let's go.

562
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,279
-Mr. So!
-Good grief.

563
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,114
What did I just witness?

564
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,075
Those two?

565
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,161
Why would that perfectly
normal man date my sister?

566
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,080
It just happened. Play it cool.

567
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,168
What's that?

568
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,503
Oh, that.

569
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,839
It's my love letter.

570
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,341
I wanted to give it to my honeybun
after our date tonight.

571
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,177
What kind of sweet words did you write

572
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,637
to make them freak out like that?

573
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,876
Were you crying?

574
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,338
Get your eyes checked. Why would I cry?

575
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,634
Why would she cry
after coming all the way to Seoul?

576
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,603
Mr. Lee.

577
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,896
I'm here, Mr. Park.

578
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,482
I'll execute the plan starting tomorrow.

579
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,068
There's no real plan here,
so don't stress about it.

580
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,739
I only sent you to keep an eye
on him and pressure him a little.

581
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,823
Don't worry.

582
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,035
My face is forgettable
even after several encounters.

583
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,245
I was left behind
on multiple school trips.

584
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,081
People think of me as wallpaper.

585
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,542
I've never been noticed in my entire life.

586
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,754
So I'm confident about this spy mission.

587
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,213
Yes.

588
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:25,173
PYEONGWON STATION

589
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,217
All right, then. I'll buy you a drink
when you come back.

590
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,218
Okay.

591
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,843
A lucky charm for Park Ki-se.

592
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,222
Wow, Ki-se!

593
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,391
-I found one.
-You found one? Wow!

594
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,393
How did you find such a big one?

595
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,229
Let's be happy together
for as long as we can.

596
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,530
What are you doing, Ki-se?

597
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,121
POTATO LAB

598
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:41,791
There you are.

599
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,168
Are you still scared of me?

600
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,004
I told you already. I didn't write that!

601
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,213
-Ms. Kim.
-Okay.

602
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,717
I know we're at work right now,
but I have to explain myself.

603
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,301
I'm not that big of a pervert.

604
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,555
I mean, if you ask me
if I think of you in that way,

605
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,223
I wouldn't completely deny it.

606
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,600
But I'm not perverted
to the point of writing

607
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,310
those unspeakable things in that letter.

608
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,479
People often imagine various scenarios

609
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,189
when they have feelings for someone.

610
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,693
But the things I want to do with you
are socially acceptable…

611
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:43,728
There's the hardworking Ms. Jjeon!

612
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,398
For all your hard work,
we should be giving you something better.

613
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,609
But this is all we can do for now.

614
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,112
You shouldn't have.

615
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,906
Are there Shine Muscats in there?

616
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,407
-Yes, they're in here.
-Okay.

617
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:06,751
Ms. Jjeon, about what you heard
in the break room…

618
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,004
I don't want you to misinterpret things--

619
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,298
Misinterpret what?

620
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,967
You two are seeing each other.

621
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,805
Ms. Kim did something
filthy and perverted,

622
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:23,518
so Chief So is about to run for his life.
Am I wrong?

623
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,229
You're completely off base.

624
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,064
It wasn't me who…

625
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,109
That's not important.

626
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,028
There's nothing going on between us.

627
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,905
We're seeing each other.

628
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,536
And we want to be careful.

629
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,622
We hope you'll keep
what you heard today to yourself.

630
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,208
Of course I will.

631
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,293
I can roll with it.

632
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:53,214
I'll zip it. Don't you worry.

633
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,717
You're the best, Ms. Jjeon.

634
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,011
We're a family bonded by potatoes.

635
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,097
-Of course.
-Thank you for understanding.

636
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,599
But…

637
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,185
I wish you'd asked me earlier.

638
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,730
On my way here, I happened

639
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,400
to run into Ms. Park and Paeng.

640
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,819
I've already run my mouth.

641
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:22,660
Hey.

642
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,078
Hurry up.

643
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,084
Where are they?

644
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,544
Hold on.

645
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,254
They're over there.

646
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,841
Ms. Park! Paeng!

647
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,468
Go inside and give this to them.

648
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,970
And thank them for their hard work.

649
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,305
-Okay.
-Got it?

650
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,514
Someone's calling.

651
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,018
Jeez.

652
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,729
Mr. Park, I can't talk right now…

653
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,857
Ms. Kim. I heard
you and Chief So are getting married.

654
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,416
I have an announcement.

655
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,089
I can't stop the rumors.

656
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,132
It would be better

657
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:04,220
to hear it from me
than to hear it from someone else.

658
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,640
I, Kim Mi-kyung…

659
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,396
and Chief Hong's nemesis
and Jangsaeng killer, Chief So Baek-ho…

660
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,064
Be quiet.

661
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,068
Give me the number
of the Sobong-ri Crop Team leader,

662
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,194
Ms. Dog.

663
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,320
Of course.

664
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,740
Sorry?

665
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,539
Oh, gosh.

666
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,084
What? Come on.

667
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,545
I saw this coming.

668
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,339
Ms. Dog, do you want to go out for lunch?

669
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:43,968
Nonsense. Ms. Dog should
have lunch with her groom-to-be.

670
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,761
What do you mean, "groom-to-be"?

671
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,763
We've been on one date.

672
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,349
We're not even officially dating yet.

673
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,268
Is that so?

674
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,353
Okay, then make sure
the wedding is at a hotel.

675
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:55,354
I have to go

676
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,566
purchase 20 face massage sessions
to get rid of my double chin.

677
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,443
Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog…

678
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,820
-Let's go to lunch, Ms. Dog.
-Oh my gosh.

679
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,865
Time for your chow.

680
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,913
MS. KIM MI-KYUNG

681
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,832
How did it go?

682
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,389
Mr. So!

683
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,311
You're lonely no more.

684
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,438
-Mr. Lee?
-Yes, it's me.

685
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,233
Your number one fan,
Section Chief Lee Seung-hoon.

686
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:44,403
What are you doing here, Mr. Lee?

687
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,738
Weren't you expecting me?

688
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,996
Here.

689
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,336
DISPATCH ORDER

690
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,839
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PARK KI-SE

691
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,226
Jeez.

692
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,479
Yes, Mr. So.

693
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,441
Mr. Park, I don't recall
discussing Mr. Lee's dispatch with you.

694
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,821
Do we need to discuss these things
before I make a decision?

695
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,740
I could see that you were
having a hard time with the potato lab,

696
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,867
so I sent you some backup.

697
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,538
I don't need assistance. I need more time.

698
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,665
On top of my absence from the department,

699
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,417
half of the team is also in PMI.

700
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,918
So everyone has a heavy workload.

701
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,837
In this situation,
you sent a hands-on worker

702
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,256
on a long-term assignment.

703
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,967
I want to ask if that's really
the right thing to do.

704
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,848
Director So Baek-ho.

705
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,685
I'm managing the department
just fine all by myself.

706
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,521
I decided to send Mr. Lee
based on my judgment

707
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,772
that it was necessary.

708
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,401
You have one more person there
to help you, so what's the problem?

709
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,695
-I still think…
-I have a meeting now.

710
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,737
Let's talk later.

711
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,907
He's so annoying.

712
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,498
Oh my gosh! No way!

713
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,750
Have you been to his place already?

714
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,586
How was the furniture?
What about his closet?

715
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,338
And watches! Take a picture
of his watches and send it to me.

716
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,215
I'll look at the models and the brands

717
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,467
and send you the price list.

718
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,304
Oh my God, stop!
Can someone please just sedate him?

719
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,141
Resurrected! Hey, MK!

720
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,934
-Come on, tell us.
-Listen to me.

721
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,147
-That's enough.
-Hear me out.

722
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,065
-Everyone's looking.
-My ears are bleeding.

723
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,151
-Hello.
-The report…

724
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,152
Be quiet!

725
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,321
Kids these days start by kissing…

726
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,823
Things have changed, am I right?

727
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,733
Don't you want to sit
with your future spouse?

728
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,070
That's right. Everyone knows now.
Don't let him eat by himself.

729
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,365
Drop it. I don't have to eat with him.

730
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,742
And I told you, he's not my fiancé.

731
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,885
-Congratulations!
-We wish you the best!

732
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,429
What are you doing? Go away.

733
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,223
Eating at the same table
with a subordinate

734
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,309
is perfectly normal for a boss to do.

735
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,937
Besides, there seems to be
no point in hiding it anyway.

736
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,315
-But still…
-That's cold!

737
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,361
What are you doing after work?

738
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:18,534
I was asked to take a look
at something in Sobong-ri.

739
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,493
So I'm heading there.

740
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:20,953
Do you need a ride?

741
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,164
No, it's nearby.

742
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,795
What's so interesting?
Just eat your lunches, everyone.

743
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,463
-No need.
-Jeez.

744
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,674
Watching your love fills us up.

745
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,718
Continue.

746
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,014
Stop being dramatic. Jeez.

747
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,985
Yes.

748
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,165
Gosh.

749
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,629
Honeybun, what are you doing?

750
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,173
-Solving a mystery.
-What?

751
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,843
This isn't it.

752
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,428
I've been looking from every angle,

753
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,389
but nothing about her is appealing.

754
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,975
What is up with Ward B?

755
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,310
Why would he like my sister?

756
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,146
Hey, what's wrong with Mi-kyung?

757
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,983
It used to be that guys chased her
when we went out to Daehangno.

758
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,485
Seriously?

759
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,196
Not a lot of them, but some…

760
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,657
cult recruiters.

761
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,659
See? It doesn't make any sense.

762
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,244
Something doesn't add up
about that Ward B guy.

763
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,455
Maybe he's after her money

764
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,166
or wants his hands on this guesthouse.

765
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,337
Honeybun, did you just laugh at me?

766
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,380
No.

767
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,715
I think it's cute

768
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,385
that you used that useless head of yours
to come up with a theory.

769
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,596
Now, I'll tell you why
that makes no sense, Honeybun.

770
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,433
First of all, So Baek-ho
makes a shitload of money.

771
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,102
Secondly…

772
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,480
even if all three of us sold everything
we've got, including our organs,

773
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,441
he'd still have a million times
more money in his account.

774
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,986
In summary, you're holding an empty can

775
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,988
while worrying about
a Por*che driver robbing you.

776
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,907
That's what you look like right now.

777
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,701
Got it?

778
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,619
Fine, then he's not after her money.

779
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,038
He gets off on dating weird women.

780
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,332
Maybe that bastard is a creep like that.

781
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,669
Kim Mi-kyung is a bigger creep than most.

782
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,045
What?

783
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,215
So what's your plan?

784
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,884
Shouting at him,
"No, I don't like it"?

785
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,806
I'll talk to him tonight
and scare him straight.

786
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,726
I'll show him what happens
if he looks down on us.

787
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,358
Yeah, right.

788
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,076
Take a seat.

789
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,960
I'll just get to the point.

790
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,338
My uncle is a business liaison
at a construction company.

791
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,382
That means he knows a lot of muscle.

792
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,011
And one of my second cousins
is in law school, studying hard.

793
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,222
I see.

794
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,935
Why are you telling me this?

795
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,896
Why do you think?

796
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,397
The eldest daughter of Kim Jin-gyu,

797
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,858
the 38th generation descendant
of the Gimhae Kim clan.

798
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,486
Kim Mi-kyung is not someone to mess with!

799
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,704
Don't let your guard down.
I'm not finished.

800
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,167
Yes, Mr. Byun.

801
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,461
Twelve drinks in total?

802
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,129
I can make them in no time.

803
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,340
I'll get them to you right away.

804
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,554
So…

805
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,349
Due to an urgent business matter,

806
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,892
we'll continue in 30 minutes.

807
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,145
Do you need help?

808
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,900
It won't be easy for you to soften me up.

809
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,028
You have to make 12 drinks.
That seems like a lot for just one person.

810
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,446
What's the order?

811
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,325
Five Americanos, two sweet potato lattes,

812
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,786
one chamomile tea, two peppermint teas--

813
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,205
Do you use paste or powder
for the sweet potato latte?

814
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,582
Powder.

815
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,836
Then start with the teas.
I'll make the espresso.

816
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,717
Take four of each type of cookie
and heat them in the oven.

817
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:48,220
We Kims like to give to others.

818
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,722
We're very generous people.

819
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,936
The order is for 31,300 won,

820
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,813
and four cookies cost 11,200 won.

821
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,859
Your freebie is very generous.

822
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,152
What's the production cost
of these cookies?

823
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,572
Well…

824
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,616
The price of eggs is always different,

825
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,036
so I've never really thought about it.

826
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,832
Are you saying that you run a coffee shop
not knowing the production costs?

827
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,251
Is that important?

828
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,844
Hey, Hwan-kyung wants to talk to us.

829
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,262
-About what?
-I don't know.

830
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,141
What makes him think
he can boss us around?

831
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,020
What's up? What is it?

832
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,066
Have a seat. This is a very…

833
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,403
important announcement.

834
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,825
Why are you ordering us around…

835
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,707
I, Kim Hwan-kyung, had an experience today

836
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,920
that shook my world and turned
my 30-year-old life upside-down.

837
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,129
Did you fall into a ditch?

838
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,297
Focus, please.

839
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,385
It's been eight years
since I opened this guesthouse.

840
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,179
I've devoted my life
to managing this place,

841
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,681
but I've always been dirt poor,
and I finally know why!

842
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,102
I realized that you guys
are bleeding me dry.

843
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:22,689
What is this loser talking about?
Do you want me to literally bleed you dry?

844
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,608
When have you
devoted yourself to managing?

845
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,068
You're always hanging out with me.

846
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,237
Shut your mouths, freeloaders.

847
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,616
Take a look.

848
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,870
This is the balance sheet as well
as the profit and loss statement of USB.

849
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,246
And also…

850
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,540
I don't know. Some kind of statement.

851
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,837
Those clearly state

852
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,756
why you two must pay me rent.

853
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,592
-Rent?
-Are you crazy?

854
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,094
Who asks family to pay rent?

855
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,346
This is a lodging establishment.

856
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,306
Do you know
the potential revenue of the room

857
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,642
you've been crashing in
for the past six years?

858
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,310
I've been covering

859
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,604
both the fixed and variable costs
monthly on my own.

860
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,398
That's why I pay for groceries.

861
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,400
And I take you out to eat sometimes.

862
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,818
What I eat is nothing

863
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,612
compared to the 80%
that you two gobble up!

864
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:11,738
Come on.

865
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:16,994
Anyway, wire me the rent
on the 25th every month before 8:00 p.m.

866
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:20,414
Also, no more free coffee.

867
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,959
Guests get a 10% discount on drinks
and baked goods are full price.

868
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,335
Jeez.

869
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,754
What if I don't agree to this?

870
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,715
What if I refuse to pay?

871
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,135
Then there's the door, ma'am.

872
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,224
That little…

873
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,185
What's gotten into him?

874
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,021
He was fine earlier.

875
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,313
I know.

876
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:49,693
Maybe he watched
a financial consulting show on TV.

877
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,652
That's not it.

878
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,655
Ward B!

879
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,789
Hey, you! Get out here right now!

880
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,514
Is something the matter?

881
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:21,475
Hey, you. We need to talk.

882
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,479
Come over here. I won't hurt you.

883
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,236
You!

884
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,325
What did you do to our Hwan-kyung?

885
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,578
What slick words did you use on him

886
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,371
to suddenly make him smart?

887
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,049
We briefly discussed

888
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,135
business management earlier.

889
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,929
Is there a problem?

890
00:59:59,012 --> 00:59:59,888
A problem?

891
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,559
Yes, there is. He handed us
a well-made statement of profit and loss

892
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:07,354
and asked his own sister to pay rent.

893
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,940
Can't you see the crime
you've committed?

894
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,818
This boy has been
an innocent lamb his whole life,

895
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,611
but you've turned him against us--

896
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,822
That was never my intention. As you know,

897
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,241
the guesthouse is a financial disaster,

898
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,700
so I wanted to help a little--

899
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,786
You didn't just help a little.

900
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,539
You told him about the revenue
he could generate if he opened up

901
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,165
the second floor in Ward A for guests.

902
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,544
You went into detail about
how he could squeeze money out of us.

903
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,295
I was merely speaking hypothetically--

904
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,048
Why would you hypothetically say that?

905
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,425
Do you have zero self-awareness?

906
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:40,387
You're capable of persuading
anyone within five minutes.

907
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,806
How? With that perfect face.

908
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,891
Also, you're super smart and articulate.

909
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,769
You used those advantages
and your expertise in management

910
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:49,396
to corrupt an innocent kid…

911
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,816
Think about it for a second.

912
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,653
You flaunt that jawline of yours and
explain everything in that sweet voice.

913
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:57,946
Who wouldn't fall for that?

914
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,490
Did you really not consider
how cool and trustworthy

915
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,159
you'd look? Not even a little bit?

916
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,535
What are you doing?

917
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,996
Whatever!

918
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,249
I'll be broke because of the rent
and busy working two jobs for a while,

919
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,084
so I won't be able to go on dates.

920
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,752
Just know that it's your fault.

921
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,008
What? That's right.

922
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,593
I'm not dating you,

923
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,178
but I am blaming you!

924
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,187
Unbelievable.

925
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,815
I'm seriously mad this time.

926
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,317
If I start giving in,

927
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,194
grab me by the hair and stop me, okay?

928
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,570
I'm pissed too.

929
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,780
Chase me down if you see me
hanging out with Hwan-kyung.

930
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:41,990
Promise me.

931
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,658
-Okay.
-Okay.

932
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,036
Darn it.

933
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,414
Jeez.

934
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,417
What?

935
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,588
-What are you doing?
-I saw the look in your eyes earlier.

936
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:02,135
You were furious at me
for bearing down on you,

937
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,888
but deep inside…

938
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,225
your desire was burning
for this sexy, intelligent man.

939
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:13,188
So I decided to give myself
to you just for tonight.

940
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,774
Go on, take me.

941
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:19,110
The CEO of USB Guesthouse!

942
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:29,621
You!

943
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,226
Were you kicked out?

944
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,395
You're one to talk.

945
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,231
It looks like you're rushing out
to buy an apology gift.

946
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,158
Listen to me.

947
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:09,536
If I wrote down everything
my sisters have put me through,

948
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,912
it would be a saga.

949
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,124
My other big sister used to do judo.

950
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,625
Have you been hit by a truck?

951
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,168
That's what her kicks felt like.

952
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,421
They don't just hurt.
She sends you flying.

953
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,673
Before you know it, you're in the air.

954
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,303
But do you know who's scarier than her?

955
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,263
My big sister, Kim Mi-kyung.

956
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,848
I was rude to her as a teenager,

957
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,143
and she beat me with a washcloth.
You'd think that wouldn't be possible.

958
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,145
But for Kim Mi-kyung, it was.

959
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,023
She's so short-tempered too.

960
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,858
One second she's fine,
but then she flips out

961
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,944
and curses you out until your ears ring.
She's like a minefield.

962
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:45,947
Make one wrong move,
and she'll explode and kill you.

963
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,159
I know that Ms. Kim can get mad easily.

964
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,085
What…

965
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,046
What's wrong?

966
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,506
Why are you badmouthing my sister?

967
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,760
I was just agreeing…

968
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,387
with what you said.

969
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,514
I'm family and you're not.

970
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,517
I can badmouth my sister, but you can't!

971
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,854
Right. I apologize.

972
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,195
Anyway, are you really into my sister?

973
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,905
Without any other intentions?

974
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:30,658
I am.

975
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,787
I'm recklessly into her.

976
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,501
Then be good to her.

977
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:43,755
I know she's got a bad temper,
but she's actually just a dummy.

978
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,217
Shoot.

979
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:50,512
She would beat me up
if she found out I said that.

980
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:00,397
Our mom passed away
when I was nine and Mi-kyung was fifteen.

981
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,191
We cried throughout the funeral

982
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,819
and as we laid her to rest.

983
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,114
And when we got home,

984
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,866
we saw Mom's shoes at the door.

985
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,828
The whole family burst into tears.

986
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,248
Me, my dad,
and my other sister were all crying.

987
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,667
But Mi-kyung…

988
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,169
went into the kitchen and did the dishes.

989
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,089
Back then,

990
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,633
I thought she was
a tough and strong person.

991
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:33,263
But looking back now,

992
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,141
she wasn't tough or strong.

993
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,018
She was just a dummy.

994
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,354
She didn't know how to express her pain.

995
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,566
So she just kept busy.

996
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,360
She was only 15.

997
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,117
Don't get me wrong.

998
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,661
I'm not saying that you should pity her.

999
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,496
Just try your best

1000
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,875
to figure out what's on her mind
while you're dating.

1001
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,085
Don't get beat up
with a washcloth like me.

1002
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,756
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

1003
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,760
Let's go. The store is about to close.

1004
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,555
-Hwan-kyung.
-Yes?

1005
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:19,517
What do you do
when your sister is mad at you?

1006
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,110
Mr. Park!

1007
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,321
What's going on, Mr. Lee?

1008
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,739
I thought you were in Pyeongwon.

1009
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,116
Here's the thing.

1010
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,452
I have such big news

1011
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,621
that I couldn't just
tell you over the phone.

1012
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,456
-Is that so? What is it?
-Yes.

1013
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,626
What do you want to hear first?
The good news or the bad news?

1014
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,213
The bad… no.

1015
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,964
Tell me the good news first.

1016
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:51,257
The good news?

1017
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,676
The good news is about your ex-wife.

1018
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,304
I've been staking out the guesthouse,

1019
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,224
but I didn't even catch a glimpse of her.

1020
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:04,395
I think she's left the guesthouse
and gone on vacation far away.

1021
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,525
Are you sure she hasn't
just been sleeping inside?

1022
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,818
She would easily sleep
for 24 hours straight.

1023
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,783
Then I take back the good news.

1024
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,786
I'll tell you the bad news next.

1025
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:24,666
What is it?

1026
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,548
Mr. So is seeing
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung.

1027
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,351
What?

1028
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:47,897
Come on.

1029
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:51,025
Who told you that So Baek-ho
is seeing Kim Mi-kyung?

1030
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:54,070
Everyone at the potato lab
is talking about it--

1031
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,573
That's just a rumor. I know those two.

1032
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:01,202
Kim Mi-kyung can't stand people
who are rigid and strict, like So Baek-ho.

1033
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:03,246
And So Baek-ho
doesn't associate with people

1034
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,623
who are as fiery as Kim Mi-kyung.

1035
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,710
There's no way those two
are seeing each other.

1036
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:09,836
Come on.

1037
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,214
They seemed to be
pretty open about it themselves.

1038
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,386
What?

1039
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,055
Look at this.

1040
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:23,850
What am I looking at?

1041
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,810
Mr. So

1042
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,272
is notorious for not joining anyone
for lunch at Wonhan.

1043
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,273
But earlier today,

1044
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:34,027
he put his plate down
right in front of Ms. Kim.

1045
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,321
People were teasing them,

1046
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:38,740
saying, "Look at that! No way!"

1047
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:41,951
But he just sat there and ate his lunch.

1048
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:46,205
"There seems to be
no point in hiding it anyway."

1049
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,582
That's what he said.

1050
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,253
Wait, are you serious right now?

1051
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,880
I'm totally serious.

1052
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,134
No way.

1053
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,428
These two…

1054
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:05,975
No way.

1055
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,148
PARK KI-SE

1056
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,737
I'm driving. Make it quick.

1057
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:22,909
Ms. Yoon, about the incident
from six years ago…

1058
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,994
I don't even remember
what I had for lunch yesterday.

1059
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,913
What incident from six years ago?
Be specific.

1060
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:31,376
Do you remember Kim Mi-kyung
from the Product Planning Department?

1061
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,509
How ridiculous.

1062
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,225
SOFTIE SWEETIE
OPEN THE DOOR

1063
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,309
Jeez.

1064
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,104
Does he think he can just boss me around?

1065
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,154
Darn it.

1066
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:07,620
Peek-a-boo!

1067
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,541
You've got to be kidding.

1068
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,543
What am I? A little girl?

1069
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:29,767
Ta-da!

1070
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,234
I appreciate your effort,

1071
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,944
but no thanks.

1072
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,195
Just give up.

1073
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,661
Come on.

1074
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,209
What?

1075
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,047
Why couldn't he have done it all at once?

1076
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,676
Why make me go
up and down the stairs again?

1077
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,927
Jeez.

1078
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,471
Are you kidding me…

1079
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:07,555
Oh my gosh!

1080
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,390
Oh my!

1081
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:18,107
Can you forgive me now?

1082
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:23,571
This was the biggest one I could find.

1083
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,411
No! Go away!

1084
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,834
This guy didn't do anything wrong.
I'm taking him with me.

1085
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:41,756
Shoot.

1086
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,551
You leave me no choice.

1087
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,542
Kim Mi-kyung. Come on.

1088
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,421
What is your problem?

1089
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,527
You don't know…

1090
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,926
what So Baek-ho…

1091
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,471
has done to you.

1092
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,982
Why? Is it that bad?

1093
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,275
No.

1094
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,694
I can fix it.

1095
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:15,219
So I wasn't trying to see
you shirtless or anything.

1096
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,305
It's all right. At any rate,
you'll see it soon enough, anyway.

1097
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,225
I think I've been bitten by
something lethal.

1098
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:24,729
Are you insane? What are you doing?

1099
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,313
Why? What's going on?

1100
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,357
Let me ask you directly.

1101
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,317
Have you been acting strange
toward me lately…

1102
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,486
How-- how serious, exactly?

1103
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,655
I can't let you sleep here alone.

1104
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:36,949
What do you mean?

1105
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,952
I'm not being soft or sweet.
I'm making a move.

1106
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:41,746
Do you not want me to?

1107
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,878
