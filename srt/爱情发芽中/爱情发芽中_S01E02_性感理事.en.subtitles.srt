1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,955
THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,874
In case you missed it…

3
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,878
Ms. Kim, 36 years old
and without any dreams, hopes, or assets,

4
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,798
is left alone and on the brink of failure

5
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,092
after the company she worked for
went under.

6
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,344
Meanwhile, at Ms. Kim's
brother's guesthouse,

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,804
where she's freeloading,

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,597
an unexpected visitor arrives.

9
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,432
Someone who holds
Ms. Kim's fate in his hands.

10
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,851
Someone who's in the prime of his life.

11
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,271
Her young, handsome boss.

12
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,022
So Baek…

13
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,399
Ho!

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,067
Seriously, would you stop?

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,860
The dumb voiceover isn't helping anyone!

16
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,696
Frankly, it's super freaking rude.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,657
Ms. Kim, royally pissed,

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,535
takes it out on her poor friend…

19
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,497
You.

20
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,166
You really let him check into Ward B?

21
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,127
The jerk from Wonhan Retail?

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,463
The bastard who came to mess with our lab?

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,554
I'll give you ten seconds.

24
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,056
Get out there right now and kick him out.

25
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,058
-I can't do that.
-Ten.

26
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,394
Nine.

27
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,981
-Eight.
-I can't!

28
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,358
I already bought a dryer with the money.

29
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,778
And a cypress steamer
and an automatic rotating pot.

30
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,947
So what? It's not like
they cost a fortune.

31
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,283
I can buy them too!
I'll buy them for you!

32
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,535
Yeah, right. You barely make anything.

33
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,786
How dare you.

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,580
Wait, this is so unfair.

35
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,790
It's not like I knew he was from Wonhan!

36
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,793
He said he'll rent out the whole ward
for at least a month,

37
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,212
so I thought he was
just a crazy rich dude!

38
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,464
But then we started talking

39
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,132
about why he was here,
and that's when I--

40
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,426
You should've said no then!

41
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,720
Just thinking about how
that man kicked out our chief

42
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,473
and barged into the lab
makes me freaking furious!

43
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,059
So why do I have to see his stupid face

44
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,228
seven days a week, 24/7?

45
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,231
Wonhan at work, Wonhan at home,
freaking Wonhan everywhere!

46
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,569
Do you want to see your sister
explode and die from anger?

47
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,528
Mi-kyung, Mi-kyung.

48
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,822
You should go put on
some nicotine patches first.

49
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,200
You're way too worked up right now.

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,247
And as the person
with the highest IQ in this group,

51
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,291
I'd like to put my two cents in.

52
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,626
I'm with Hwan-kyung.

53
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,294
-Hey!
-But he's right.

54
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,213
The last guest we had was four months ago.

55
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,674
This guesthouse had no guests

56
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,510
and just functioned as a house,
but now it finally has a guest

57
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,762
and can actually serve its purpose!

58
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,265
But you want to kick him out?
What is he supposed to do?

59
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,729
I'm sorry, Mi-kyung.

60
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,192
But I haven't had a guest in so long,
I can't let him go.

61
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,820
It feels like it's my fault
that business is bad

62
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,447
and I'm doing nothing with my inheritance.

63
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,742
I had even thought about
shutting this place down.

64
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,164
Damn.

65
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,545
For heaven's sake.

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,466
Fine. So?

67
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,970
Exactly how much is he paying for rent?

68
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,349
"He was virtuous even
as they aided him in need,

69
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,685
and those in and out of court admire him."

70
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,228
EPISODE 2
THE HOT DIRECTOR

71
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,148
"What more can one say
about the thoughts of the people?"

72
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,235
"If you lose your virtues as king,
even your kin will betray you."

73
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,206
Ta-da! Welcome!

74
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,793
Make room for some shiny,
sparkling memories in your heart!

75
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,629
Welcome to USB Guesthouse!

76
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,427
Yes, thank you.

77
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:22,971
Wait.

78
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,267
As the owner's family,
that was my duty to our guest.

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,520
But I personally have a few things to say.

80
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,274
This doesn't seem to be
a mere coincidence to me.

81
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,986
You became the new chief of the potato lab
despite knowing nothing about potatoes.

82
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,822
Well, I guess we can chalk that one up
to Wonhan's bad decision-making.

83
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,699
But why are you here, of all places?

84
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,494
There are a number of hotels
and resorts nearby.

85
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,829
Not to mention
the numerous guesthouses!

86
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,873
I mean, if you're swimming in money,

87
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,666
you could've just gotten an apartment.

88
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,089
I assume you're not going to leave
until I give you an explanation.

89
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,807
Hotels and resorts are convenient,
but don't allow you to cook,

90
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,434
and there wasn't an apartment
I could rent for just one month.

91
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,770
There are only seven places
within 50 kilometers of the lab

92
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,357
that accommodate
electric vehicle charging.

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,235
The closest one to the lab
was USB Guesthouse.

94
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,029
Any more questions?

95
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,658
No.

96
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,660
Well, that's very…

97
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,037
very reasonable of you.

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,331
I don't make decisions
unless they're reasonable.

99
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,290
Goodbye.

100
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,251
Wait, hold on.

101
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,924
It seems like we'll be seeing a lot of
each other, whether we like it or not.

102
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,343
So let's set some ground rules.

103
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,763
Does anyone know that you're staying here?

104
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,306
-No.
-Good.

105
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,393
Then let's keep it that way.
Don't tell people at the lab.

106
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,144
I don't want the rumor mill churning.

107
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,271
Sure.

108
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,276
And I think we should keep work
and private life separate.

109
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,153
Here, there's no director
or assistant manager.

110
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,322
It's just two normal people,
Ms. Kim and Mr. So.

111
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,617
I want to leave my job at the door
when I come home.

112
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,369
-Do you agree?
-Yes.

113
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,666
One more thing.

114
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,960
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.

115
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,840
Don't underestimate our lab.

116
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,008
All right.

117
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,093
I'm serious.

118
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,179
If you mess around,
especially with our potatoes,

119
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,432
-I won't just stand by.
-Understood.

120
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,858
Yes. Well, that was all I had to say.

121
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,777
Do you have anything else to say?

122
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,698
Perhaps, "Please take good care of me.
I'm out of my depth"?

123
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,741
Or maybe,

124
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,535
"It's a shame what happened to Mr. Hong"?

125
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,913
I do have a question.

126
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,086
That thing on your head.

127
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,047
Is that floss?

128
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,090
Pardon?

129
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,594
My head? What?

130
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,938
Yes, it is. It's mine.

131
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,232
I'm going to use it later.

132
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,652
Okay. Good night.

133
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,450
Oh, jeez.

134
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,410
Where did this even come from?

135
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,044
Hey, Ong-ju.

136
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,171
Did you know there was floss on my head?

137
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,130
What?

138
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,759
I was flossing on the sofa
and lost some.

139
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,887
Ew, why are you so disgusting?

140
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,935
What's with that face?

141
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,770
What scheme are you cooking up now?

142
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,355
Mi-kyung.

143
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,899
Now that it's just us, tell me.

144
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,985
Be honest.

145
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,700
What are you doing?

146
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,868
Come on!

147
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,161
You!

148
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,834
What is going on?

149
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,876
What?

150
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,837
Are your eyes twitching?

151
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,380
Take some magnesium.

152
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,173
Ugh, you're so frustrating.

153
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,967
You, Kim Mi-kyung.

154
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,678
You're interested in the guest
in Ward B, aren't you?

155
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,807
Here you go again with your damn ideas.

156
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,184
No,

157
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,770
I'm not saying this
because I write romance.

158
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,564
I can smell the rom-com cliché

159
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,567
just wafting off of you and Ward B!

160
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,069
You're at the stage where
you're bickering while growing closer!

161
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,237
Is that right?

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,780
When's my paycheck coming in?

163
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,865
I mean it!

164
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,992
Just listen to me.

165
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,244
Sheesh.

166
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,913
I have proof here
that So Baek-ho is your destiny.

167
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,625
SUNGBUK MIDDLE SCHOOL
2004 GRADUATION ALBUM

168
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,626
Here we are.

169
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,504
Yes. Exhibit A.

170
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,508
The boy you had a crush on
for all three years of middle school.

171
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,760
And!

172
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,761
Exhibit B.

173
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,056
In freshman year, you confessed
to this guy and got rejected four times.

174
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,392
And the most decisive evidence.

175
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,977
Exhibit C.

176
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,147
Your all-time favorite
romance novel protagonist.

177
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,399
The Hot Director's Secret!

178
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,736
Okay? So what about it?

179
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,782
You still don't see
what they have in common?

180
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,453
Kim Ji-ho. Park Young-ho. Ryu Jung-ho.

181
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,207
You're attracted to good-looking men
whose name ends with "ho."

182
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,501
Ji-ho, Young-ho, Jung-ho. And Baek-ho!

183
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,670
What do you think?
Doesn't it give you chills?

184
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,048
Doesn't it feel like a huge awakening?

185
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,342
So…

186
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,055
being attracted to good-looking men
with "ho" in their name…

187
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,932
is my destiny?

188
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,183
Yes.

189
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,108
By any chance…

190
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,279
did you get shot in the head as a kid?

191
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,989
What?

192
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,284
You have to be kidding me.

193
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,869
Hey, Lee Ong-ju, thank you so much.

194
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,164
You made me laugh
for the first time today. You're the best!

195
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,084
You're so rude,
making fun of a professional's advice.

196
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,086
Wait, hey. Hold on.

197
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,964
Tell me when I'm destined to die.

198
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,135
You just watch.
You're going to fall for him. I know it.

199
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,011
It will happen soon,

200
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,848
around the end of Episode 2.

201
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,308
Jeez.

202
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,356
He'll be lucky if I'm not fighting
with him by then.

203
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,490
YOU HAVE NEW MAIL

204
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,127
Oh, it's here.

205
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,924
LIST OF EXTERNAL VISITORS AS REQUESTED

206
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,719
VISITOR LIST

207
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,929
Let's see. Kim Mi-kyung.

208
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,681
Kim Mi-kyung.

209
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,267
Mi-kyung Kim.

210
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,186
God damn it.

211
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,231
Where in the world did you pop out from?

212
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,152
For God's sake.

213
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,155
Kim Mi-kyung?

214
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,622
Gosh.

215
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,134
Whoa, what?

216
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,677
What is this?

217
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,638
Ms. Kim! Come look! Oh, that's hot.

218
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,933
Ms. Kim, who drives a car
this nice at our lab?

219
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,186
I don't know. Maybe someone
in the admin building won the lottery?

220
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,729
-Hey, this is heavy.
-Here.

221
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,231
Did you hear anything?

222
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,732
Beats me.

223
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,487
We're back.

224
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,988
-Hey, MK.
-Welcome back.

225
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:19,948
-Hello.
-Any contracts?

226
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,741
A ton of them took my business card.

227
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,534
I'll just have to latch on when they call.

228
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,619
Good luck.

229
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,121
-Has Mr. Bu not moved?
-Put yourself in his shoes.

230
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,166
Wouldn't you be pissed about having
someone much younger as your boss?

231
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,460
I can hear you.

232
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,045
That's what I'm saying.

233
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,714
They look like father and son
when they're together.

234
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,927
I said, I can hear you.

235
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,846
By the way, should we be
so chill about this?

236
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,057
I'm telling you, he's something else.

237
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,767
Shouldn't we be doing something?

238
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,145
We don't stand a chance against him.

239
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,189
His nickname at Wonhan is ATH.

240
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,233
What?

241
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,279
"All Talk…

242
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,322
from Hell."

243
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,785
He never gets worked up,

244
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,329
and he's super polite and respectful.

245
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,348
And in the calmest voice,

246
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,183
he skins you alive with his words.

247
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,561
Hence, ATH.

248
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,565
Oh my goodness, he's crazy.

249
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,275
Tell us more. They say he's a jerk, right?

250
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,568
Has he caused any trouble?

251
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,195
Any crimes he committed
that only his friends know about?

252
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,324
Come on, why would you ask
about stuff like that?

253
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,618
What cologne does he use?

254
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,787
He smelled so nice.

255
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,749
Sorry, I only heard about the nickname.

256
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,002
He's acting all mysterious, isn't he?

257
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,837
What is this, a hearing?

258
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,715
Get up.

259
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,842
Let's go eat.

260
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,844
-Let's go eat.
-Let's go eat.

261
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,846
Is it lunchtime already?

262
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,186
-What's for lunch today?
-Just like a newbie to ask.

263
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,148
You should've checked for yourself
instead of asking me, Hee-dong.

264
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,858
It's on the notice board.

265
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,984
Hold on.

266
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,530
Anyone else
just see a really bright light?

267
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,710
CHIEF'S OFFICE

268
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,768
He's so good-looking.

269
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,155
Let me introduce myself properly.

270
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,449
I'm the interim chief, So Baek-ho.

271
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,118
-Hello.
-Hello.

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,126
Thank you.

273
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,975
I had heard that
you were starting work next week.

274
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,270
Yes, I came by today
to set up the office.

275
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,731
Wow, he's eager
to erase all traces of Mr. Hong.

276
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,529
I gathered all the meat I could find.

277
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,490
Sausages, stir-fried pork,

278
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,658
and I told the kitchen
to fry up some pork cutlets.

279
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,327
If you can just wait for ten minutes--

280
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,328
I…

281
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,996
don't eat meat.

282
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,000
You're vegetarian.

283
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,881
Then all you can eat
are kimchi and stir-fried potatoes.

284
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,882
Is that okay?

285
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,801
It's fine. Let's eat.

286
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,928
-Yes.
-Yes.

287
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,983
Where are you from, Mr. So?

288
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,319
-Seoul.
-I see.

289
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,695
Oh, wait.

290
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,948
Ms. Kim is also from Seoul.

291
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,407
You two are from the same area.

292
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,451
Really?

293
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,256
I'm…

294
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,383
just curious.

295
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,468
-Are you married?
-No.

296
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,470
Do you have plans to get married?

297
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,972
Not yet, no.

298
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
-I see.
-I see.

299
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,982
Ms. Jjeon! Here, come on in!

300
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,693
Hey!

301
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,736
The young man who took a tumble last time?

302
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,905
Hello, I'm the interim chief, So Baek--

303
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,576
Oh my God, you're alive!

304
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,453
I didn't see you after that,
so I thought you died.

305
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,377
Anyway, aren't you
some higher-up in Seoul?

306
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,004
How did you end up here?

307
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,381
Don't be naive.

308
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,843
He probably got on someone's bad side.

309
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,220
No, it's nothing like that.

310
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,390
We're overhauling the lab.

311
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,434
-So he's here to be chief.
-Yes!

312
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,852
It's long overdue.

313
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,521
-Hire more people, buy more trucks.
-Yes.

314
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,647
Raise our pay.

315
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,357
-That's right.
-Yes.

316
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,985
Isn't Wonhan a super huge company?

317
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,404
Take good care of us.

318
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,157
Sunnyeo Food

319
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,284
was so stingy,

320
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,036
it was like they had no balls.

321
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,746
Goodness.

322
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,874
Are you a baby?
Why are you spilling everywhere?

323
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,084
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

324
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,340
Ms. Park, didn't you wipe
your feet with that?

325
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,426
Wow, look at his eyes!

326
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,095
I'm kidding! Just joking with you.

327
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,645
-Thank you.
-No problem.

328
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,024
I…

329
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,942
Please excuse me.

330
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,486
-What?
-Don't be silly.

331
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,198
Just eat. We won't bother you anymore.

332
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,991
Everyone, please be quiet.

333
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,953
The chief is eating, everyone!

334
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,665
Eat up, eat up.

335
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,833
Go on.

336
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,260
You must have gotten
crazy good grades in school.

337
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,262
I wonder what he ate to grow so tall.

338
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,890
Your mother must be happy
just looking at you.

339
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,101
Do you have a girlfriend?
Oh my goodness.

340
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,103
Your eyes are as big as a calf's!

341
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,314
Gosh, you must've drunk really good milk
to be so tall and have such good skin.

342
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,358
Look, you missed a spot here. There we go.

343
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,317
All done.

344
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,954
You're leaving so soon?

345
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,166
Smoking is not allowed
on laboratory grounds.

346
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,129
This is a vape to help me quit.

347
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,839
Gosh.

348
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,261
I thought you might turn the lab
upside down as the new chief.

349
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,179
But you seem calmer
than I expected.

350
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,558
That's good, I approve.

351
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,061
Try to do and touch as little as possible.

352
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,980
Then I'll know my warning worked.

353
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,151
When did you warn me exactly, Ms. Kim?

354
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,487
I told you yesterday.

355
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,489
I won't let you mess with my lab.

356
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,659
You said you understood.
Or did you already forget that?

357
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,744
I see.

358
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,248
Why are you laughing like that?

359
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,333
I think you've misunderstood something.

360
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,421
Warnings can only be given by someone
who is either at equal standing or higher

361
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,924
and has the ability to hand out penalties
when said warning is unheeded.

362
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,594
Therefore, what you told me yesterday

363
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,262
is simply a complaint.

364
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,766
-A complaint?
-Shall I speak more plainly?

365
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,351
You could also call what you said

366
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,228
"throwing a fit" or "whining."

367
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,903
What a funny one you are, Mr. So.

368
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,821
Dividing people by class
in the 21st century?

369
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,699
I'm talking about the hierarchy
in a working environment.

370
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,451
But it feels like
you're being dismissive.

371
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,787
-It's very hurtful.
-Then tell me.

372
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,747
If you won't stand for it,

373
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,082
what actions could you take against me?

374
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,251
In protest,

375
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,086
will you slack off?

376
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,630
Not show up?

377
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,381
Resign?

378
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,806
Furthermore, you were the one
who suggested keeping work

379
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,140
and private life separate.

380
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,560
At work, I would appreciate it
if you would refer to me

381
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,230
by my proper title, Chief So.

382
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,303
What?

383
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,145
You see, this is a 21st century car.

384
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,695
I'll see you at the guesthouse.

385
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,995
What a freaking jerk!

386
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,456
Should I just beat him up
and go to jail? Jeez!

387
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,756
STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PARK KI-SE

388
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,967
We need to talk.

389
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,847
I know you're family,

390
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,016
but please knock
before coming in, Ms. Yoon.

391
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,309
We're at work.

392
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,145
You're not with Hee-jin anymore,
so we aren't family.

393
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,564
Oh, right. Your divorce is still a secret.

394
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,565
Fine.

395
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,151
We'll keep up the pretense,

396
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,193
Ki-se.

397
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,245
What happened with Baek-ho?

398
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,082
-Pardon?
-Don't play dumb with me.

399
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,127
I know you sent him to that lab, Mr. Park.

400
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,006
The new chief has some visa issues
and is currently in the US.

401
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,799
So he's been temporarily assigned.

402
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,928
Doesn't it sound ridiculous to you
just to say it?

403
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,765
You couldn't procure
a doctor of agriculture fast enough,

404
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,185
so you send down a board member
to fill a general manager position?

405
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,981
I was aware of your inferiority complex
towards Baek-ho,

406
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,317
but you've crossed a line this time.

407
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,737
You're so sly.

408
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,197
No wonder Hee-jin couldn't stay--

409
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,657
That's enough.

410
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,286
-I think you've said enough.
-I don't think I have.

411
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,331
It's disgusting to act like
a good person and a good friend,

412
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,292
while pulling this kind of move
behind his back.

413
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,002
I don't want any excuses.

414
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,505
Bring back Director So right now.

415
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,633
As you know, Chairman Wang cares more
about Director So than you.

416
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,512
That's why I sent him away.

417
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,598
There's been a lot of talk

418
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,600
-about Chairman Wang and Mr. So.
-So what?

419
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,687
Everyone knows that Baek-ho received
a scholarship at the Wonhan Foundation,

420
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,230
and that Ms. Wang was his sponsor.

421
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,440
And everyone wonders
if there's something else.

422
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,275
Whether Mr. So
is in an improper relationship

423
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,486
with the chairman, for example.

424
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,363
Are you kidding me?

425
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,490
My mom and a kid like him?

426
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,326
It's not just Chairman Wang
they're talking about.

427
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,995
It's you too, Ms. Yoon.

428
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,746
You're always dropping by his office,

429
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,290
saying, "Let's go eat,
let's grab a drink."

430
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,417
Wow.

431
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,920
The rest of the rumors are so distasteful,

432
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,256
I can't bear to say them out loud.

433
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,427
At any rate, right now,

434
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,721
it will be best for Mr. So to lay low.

435
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,805
So,

436
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,641
you should stop asking about him too.

437
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,770
I'm sure rumors
of your unrequited affections

438
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,522
are a blow to your pride.

439
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,374
Yes, Ms. Wang.

440
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,419
My goodness, Chief So.

441
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,671
Is this random or what?

442
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,465
Did you get banished or something?

443
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,719
I was planning on going back and forth
for a while due to restructuring issues.

444
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,014
As an R&D department,
it also requires a more meticulous review.

445
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,683
Don't overthink it.

446
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,102
That tiny lab won't make a dent anywhere.

447
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,480
If you say fire them, they'll be fired.

448
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,523
If you say shut it down,
it'll be shut down.

449
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,941
Just say the word.

450
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,693
I'll inform you once I make a decision.

451
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,403
Okay.

452
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,488
Goodbye.

453
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,380
PERSONNEL RECORD CARD
ASSISTANT MANAGER KIM MI-KYUNG

454
00:26:58,909 --> 00:26:59,952
All done?

455
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,371
Come on, put down a card.

456
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,164
I just did.

457
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,626
-That's a point for me too.
-You lost it?

458
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,169
Hello!

459
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,587
-Hey!
-You're here.

460
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,340
-Hey, Hippo!
-I'm coming.

461
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,550
-Leave it there.
-Yes, sir!

462
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,592
Good.

463
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:17,970
How much?

464
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,180
-Eighteen thousand won.
-Eighteen thousand won.

465
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,850
And here you go.
This is on the house.

466
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,519
-Gosh.
-Sweetie, you didn't have to.

467
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,397
You can't make money
if you keep doing this.

468
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,816
And you make up for it
by ordering all the time.

469
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,360
If it wasn't for your coffees,
we would be starving!

470
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,736
Gosh.

471
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,823
By the way, did someone come to stay?

472
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,908
I saw a truck over there last time.

473
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,369
And there were cars
I hadn't seen before.

474
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,580
You mean the guest?

475
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,000
What kind of guest brings over a truck?

476
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,169
Well, the thing is, my lab…

477
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,838
Yeah?

478
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,842
If you won't stand for it,

479
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,178
what actions could you take against me?

480
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,651
What? Here's a handkerchief.

481
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,528
-What's wrong?
-Here, take this.

482
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,074
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you sorry?

483
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,328
It's just…

484
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,833
I get so upset every time
I think about Mr. Hong.

485
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,376
Chief Hong?

486
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,296
You mean Hong Soon-ik,
Youngeul-ri's own potato doctor?

487
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,173
Why? Did something happen to him?

488
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,095
-No, I can't.
-My word!

489
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,474
Go on, just spit it out already.

490
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,768
-What?
-Well, the thing is…

491
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,981
I really didn't want to be
the bearer of such news, but…

492
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,149
You see…

493
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,485
Our Chief Hong…

494
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,407
-Come on.
-Hey, are you bringing everyone?

495
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,117
-Are you busy?
-What? Yes, the guesthouse.

496
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,494
-Where did you go?
-Yeah, okay.

497
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,703
Come to the guesthouse!

498
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,871
And here we go.

499
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,666
You need me to come? Okay.

500
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,626
-I'll be right there.
-Wait, where are you going?

501
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,169
-Yes, we're on our way.
-Come on!

502
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,216
Right now? The guesthouse?

503
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,509
Come on, hurry up!

504
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,889
All right, let's go!

505
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,990
YOUNGEUL-RI

506
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,730
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

507
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,449
Nice to meet you.

508
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,993
I'm the Youngeul-ri
Youth Association President.

509
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,746
He's the Village Development
Committee Chair. And this man here,

510
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,664
he's Mr. Byun, the village head.

511
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,376
Hello.

512
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,462
I hear you're the new chief
of the potato lab.

513
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,639
Yes, I am.

514
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,057
My name's So Baek-ho.

515
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,478
Where are your manners, young man?

516
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,357
If you've moved here, then you should
come say hello to the village elders!

517
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,526
How dare you make us come to you?

518
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,528
There must be a misunderstanding.

519
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,905
I did not move here.
I'm staying here as a guest.

520
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,241
Aren't you staying for over a month?

521
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,535
Then according to our village rules,

522
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,788
you're not a guest, you're a resident!
A temporary resident.

523
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,249
-Mr. Park.
-Yes!

524
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,843
"Regarding Residents,
Article 2, Clause 3."

525
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,303
"A person who resides in Youngeul-ri
for more than 31 days

526
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,180
will be considered
a temporary resident,

527
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,641
regardless of their permanent address.

528
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,477
Furthermore, they are obligated
to partake in paying

529
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,521
into the Village Development Fund."

530
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,858
The Village Development Fund?

531
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,070
So this is the agreement form.

532
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,489
Sign here and here.

533
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,077
And wire the money immediately
to the account listed at the bottom.

534
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,331
"Village Development Fund,
Town Track Meet Fund."

535
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,794
"Parents' Day Feast Donation Fund,
Senior Citizens Day Group Tour Fund"?

536
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,214
Mr. Byun! What's all this,
all of a sudden?

537
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,843
The total sum is 83,200 won.

538
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:54,222
Bring the signed form and the wire receipt
to the village hall by Monday, okay?

539
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,558
And if I won't?

540
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,151
Then you will have refused
to become a resident

541
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,361
and have no right to live here.

542
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,254
This is my lawyer's contact info.

543
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,549
Call him and see whether these crude forms
that you call village rules

544
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,219
are legally binding. Before that,

545
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,096
ask whether a village head can force

546
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,600
the freedom of residential mobility,
which is written in the Constitution.

547
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,062
And the session fee is on me.

548
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,608
Where are you going?

549
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,360
Stop right there!

550
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,403
Why, that little…

551
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,614
that little rude, insolent jerk!

552
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,784
-Hey! Do you even know who…
-Goddamn.

553
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,328
-…brought the electricity and water here?
-That's so hot.

554
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,371
That bastard!

555
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,041
Wow, I'm dizzy.

556
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,001
-What is this?
-That little…

557
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,005
Isn't it kind of strange, though?

558
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:12,175
That old man can be overbearing at times,

559
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,844
but he's never been so rude
to any of our guests.

560
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,265
The plot doesn't seem to be
coming together very well.

561
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,517
Something's missing.

562
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,981
That's why I'm so frustrated right now.

563
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,983
What's gotten into him?

564
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,734
No, wait a minute.

565
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,280
If my guest fights with the villagers,

566
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,156
whose side am I supposed to take?

567
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,868
How am I supposed to deal with this?

568
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,497
Well…

569
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,333
my fellow housemates.

570
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,298
If we look at this situation

571
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,633
carefully and closely,

572
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,555
you could say I had a little bit
of responsibility for this…

573
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,870
Oh, forget it.

574
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,676
Are you going somewhere?

575
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,844
No.

576
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,931
I thought it'd be rude to ignore someone
who's been standing outside the door

577
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,391
for eight minutes.

578
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,769
Then you could have opened it earlier.

579
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,689
Here, this is for you.

580
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,985
Is this an apology?

581
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,278
Pardon?

582
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,821
Aren't you here to apologize

583
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,824
for instigating the villagers
and attempting to extort money

584
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:00,992
from a guest
on your establishment?

585
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,786
Now, that's going too far.

586
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,208
I guess it was extortion.

587
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,587
Anyway, I am sorry.

588
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,716
They didn't do it for the money.

589
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,677
Mr. Hong is from here,

590
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,222
so they're all friends,
relatives, stuff like that.

591
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,432
So they were trying to be loyal…

592
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,017
You do know this is childish.

593
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,269
I do, which is why I'm apologizing.

594
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,359
Tell me the account number.
I'll send the money over.

595
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,654
Once they get the money,
they'll feel bad and return it to you.

596
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,490
There's no need.
I don't plan on sending the money.

597
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,117
-Why not?
-I'm not going to participate

598
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,618
in such unreasonable things.

599
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,579
Yeah, I'm saying that I will resolve it

600
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,832
by paying for you.

601
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,917
-Account number.
-Whoever the money belongs to,

602
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,837
wouldn't it look like I caved in?

603
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,297
-This isn't a matter of pride.
-It's one of principle.

604
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,883
I bet you would've been exiled
100 times over back in the day.

605
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,053
-Thank you.
-It wasn't a compliment.

606
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,681
Don't you have grandparents?

607
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,726
You know how they are,
when they get fixated on something

608
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,103
and get all stubborn.
You just have to go along with it.

609
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,021
-Don't you know that?
-I don't.

610
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,523
I don't have grandparents.

611
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,817
Oh, did they pass away early…

612
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,446
Wait.

613
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,030
Then what about your parents?

614
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,615
When we fight with our parents--

615
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:23,742
I'm an orphan.

616
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,618
I've never known my parents
or grandparents,

617
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,495
so I've never fought with them.

618
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,299
Okay, so what?

619
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,343
I don't judge people
based on stuff like that.

620
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,554
I still dislike you just as much now

621
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,640
as I did 30 seconds ago,
before you told me that.

622
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,809
I didn't tell you
so you would feel sorry for me.

623
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,562
I told you because you were making
ineffective analogies,

624
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,938
so we could stop wasting time.

625
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,441
Okay, fine, whatever.

626
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,862
Then do you know what it means
to make enemies with the elders

627
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,405
in a small village like this?

628
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,782
You've started a war

629
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,493
with the whole village, Mr. So Baek-ho.

630
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,996
Oh, that face again!

631
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,665
You didn't get a word I said, did you?

632
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,502
You're thinking, "What does it matter
if I get into trouble with them?"

633
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,545
I don't think it's a pressing concern.

634
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,675
Congratulations on being
better than everyone else.

635
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,595
I did what I could,
so I'm washing my hands of this.

636
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,222
Don't come crying to me later.

637
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,890
I won't need to.

638
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,900
Oh, that jerk.

639
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,653
He just has to have the last word.

640
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,010
What is this?

641
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,476
Excuse me.

642
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,062
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

643
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,439
Whoa, whoa!

644
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,441
You there! Stop. Stop.

645
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,029
It's Mr. Byun's land past that line.

646
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,866
If you cross it without permission,
it's trespassing.

647
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,749
Are you asserting a claim
over the village road right now?

648
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:21,878
It's not a claim. It's a legal fact.

649
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,796
Mr. Park.

650
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,881
Yes, sir.

651
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:33,598
This is proof
that Mr. Byun is the owner of this land.

652
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,224
And here.

653
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,144
The blue area is Mr. Byun's land.

654
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,481
The red area is where you're standing.

655
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,192
Regardless of this being Mr. Byun's land,

656
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,902
any and all roads are national property.

657
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,029
No individual can arbitrarily
block the road.

658
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,948
Yes, exactly.

659
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,116
Take a closer look.

660
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,915
That's right. There's no road on the map.

661
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,500
Why do you think that is?

662
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,710
A private road…

663
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,920
That's right.

664
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,880
A private road.

665
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,967
Which means, this road
isn't nationally owned.

666
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,635
Mr. Byun withdrew his savings

667
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,804
and built this road for
the villagers' convenience.

668
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,140
Therefore, it's up to Mr. Byun
to decide who gets to travel on it.

669
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,851
Well, I mean…

670
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,021
even if it was built by an individual--

671
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:22,981
It's all good.

672
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,150
Don't worry.

673
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,530
I also got permission from your lawyer.

674
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,489
Pardon?

675
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,450
It seems like you love the law a lot,

676
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,496
so I called the lawyer
on that business card.

677
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,416
A small road like this…

678
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,292
what did he say?

679
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,544
Customary road.

680
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,546
Customary road.

681
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,465
He said it wasn't that,
so it's up to the landowner.

682
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,553
We had a lot of questions,
so we had a long call with him.

683
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,973
The session fee came out to be
around 390,000 won.

684
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,600
You promised to pay for it,
so please do.

685
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:07,275
By the way, you know the road you see
when you go out to the right?

686
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,901
That's my wife's land.

687
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,697
Drink up. It's cold.

688
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,660
Now I think he gets it.

689
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,210
-Mr. Byun.
-Oh, it's nothing.

690
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,213
Yes, it's great. Yes.

691
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:43,978
Ridiculous.

692
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,196
THERE ARE NO TAXIS
AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA

693
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,949
Damn it.

694
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,749
Let's eat.

695
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,376
-Oh, that looks good.
-That smells delicious.

696
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,544
-Come sit.
-Have a bite.

697
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,296
-I can't, I have to go.
-What?

698
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,714
-Bye.
-Bye!

699
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,633
-What?
-What is it?

700
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,268
Did you need something?

701
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,313
Could you call me a taxi?

702
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,065
I can't call any through the app.

703
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,152
We actually don't get a lot of taxis here
because it's far from town.

704
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,780
Why do you need a taxi?
Something wrong with your car?

705
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,744
So, my car…

706
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:44,163
It was denied passage, right?
By the landowner?

707
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,958
You should've listened to me yesterday.

708
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,670
It was all valuable advice
gained from experience.

709
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,630
Good luck.

710
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,634
If you walk to the lab,
over the mountains and across the streams,

711
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,970
you'll be there before
the end of the workday.

712
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,429
Good luck, Chief So!

713
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:03,641
-Good luck!
-Thanks.

714
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:09,814
Ms. Kim.

715
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:11,983
Ms. Kim!

716
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,862
I'll pay you.

717
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,034
Please.

718
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,790
It's been exactly 12 hours

719
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,959
since you said you wouldn't need my help.

720
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:36,007
Get in. I was going to give you
a ride anyway, since it's kinda my fault.

721
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,342
Then, why…

722
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,428
I wanted to see you humbled a little.

723
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:45,641
Thank you.

724
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,938
I didn't say you could ride there.

725
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,407
Nice!

726
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,043
Whoa!

727
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,347
Oh my! Hey, wait!

728
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,375
Nice work, guys! Stay strong!

729
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,683
IT'S TOUGH FOR US
BUT IT'S WORSE FOR YOU

730
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:06,407
POTATO LAB

731
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,744
We're here.

732
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,789
Hello!

733
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,002
Hey, time to get off.

734
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,171
Hey, wait…

735
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,089
This is…

736
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,091
I mean, I can't go in with you.

737
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,260
How are we going to explain that?

738
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,845
You're right.

739
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,813
Wasn't the cool breeze so refreshing?

740
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,483
Tell me the account number already.
Better late than never.

741
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,943
No. My thoughts have not changed.

742
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,613
Seriously? Even after all this?

743
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,699
I don't change my principles
when it's convenient.

744
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,326
Thank you for today.

745
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,120
I'll get to work by myself tomorrow.

746
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,248
Sure, it's up to you.

747
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,812
Okay.

748
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,486
It's all over now.

749
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,703
DANGER
WATCH FOR FALLING ROCKS

750
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:37,933
The back road?

751
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,186
Then did you call a tow truck?

752
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,150
How did you manage
to become a director at Wonhan?

753
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,776
May I…

754
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,988
ride in the passenger seat today?

755
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,700
Sure. If you can manage it.

756
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,287
We call that the Thinking Chair.

757
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,373
Everyone who sits there becomes humbled.

758
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,999
It's your choice.

759
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,710
Will you throw out your back
or sacrifice your butt?

760
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,069
I owe you another one.

761
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,906
Just tell me the account number
and be done with it.

762
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,991
I can take care of it.

763
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,159
No! No.

764
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,744
Tomorrow, I will manage it.

765
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,205
I will.

766
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,799
What? Wait.

767
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:40,306
The bus.

768
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,437
No need to stop, go ahead.

769
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,188
-Hey.
-Take your time.

770
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,399
Bye-bye.

771
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,111
You crossed a line!

772
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,372
BUS STOP
YOUNGEUL-1RI

773
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,338
-What are you doing?
-Give me a ride. Please.

774
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,884
Under 44 kilometers per hour, if you can.

775
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,046
Oh my goodness, you're glowing.

776
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,047
You look wonderful.

777
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,841
You look amazing, gorgeous, fantastic!

778
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,219
Seoul will turn inside out
the moment you step foot in it!

779
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,180
So what do you need this time?

780
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,683
Kim Nemo Bakery in Seochon.

781
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,727
Every flavor of tea cakes and scones
and all the salt butter rolls they have.

782
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,354
I knew it.

783
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,314
You just wait for me
to go out, don't you?

784
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,941
So you can do your bread pilgrimage.

785
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,026
Yes, that's true.

786
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,072
Gosh.

787
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,910
You're going to buy them, right?
Don't forget!

788
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:28,664
CONGRATS ON YOUR MARRIAGE

789
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,933
Hey, Hwan-kyung. Hi.

790
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,227
-Hello.
-Hey.

791
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,146
Fancy seeing you here.

792
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,232
You must be headed to a wedding.

793
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,401
Yes. Are you going, too?

794
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,945
No, I'm meeting someone in the lounge.

795
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,367
How have you been?

796
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,996
-You know, can't complain.
-Right.

797
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,333
The kids must be all grown now, right?

798
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,170
Yes, Ji-oh is going to school next year.

799
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,547
Wow, time really does fly.

800
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,635
And Mi-kyung?

801
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,513
-She's fine?
-She's the same.

802
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,808
Studying potatoes by day,
drinking herself sick by night.

803
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:35,522
Studying potatoes?

804
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:42,821
Oh, sorry.

805
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,991
Yeah, I'm inside.

806
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,007
KIM MI-KYUNG

807
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,765
KIM MI-KYUNG R&D DEPT
ASSISTANT MANAGER

808
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,481
KIM MI-KYUNG
F&B, R&D POTATO LAB

809
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,113
It is you. Kim Mi-kyung.

810
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,209
Potato Lab.

811
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,006
Potato Lab?

812
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,634
So Baek-ho!

813
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:51,223
POTATO LAB

814
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,891
Ms. Kim. These here,

815
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,227
the T1, T2, T3s. What are these?

816
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,937
Those don't look like MS PDAs.

817
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,690
I'm just working on them on the side.

818
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,236
I heard that the lab over at RDA
makes all of their own PDAs.

819
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,905
-I see!
-So I made some too.

820
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,491
I lowered the amount
of potassium nitrate and calcium chloride.

821
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:10,826
Really? Is there a difference?

822
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,911
I don't know. I can't detect any so far.

823
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,872
I wonder if sucrose is the issue.

824
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:15,956
Sucrose…

825
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,295
Baegok-ri?

826
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,383
Hello, this is Kim Mi-Kyung at Potato Lab.

827
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,805
Yes, right! Okay!

828
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,475
Thank goodness you're here.

829
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,311
Call the Crop Team at Baegok-ri right now.

830
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,688
The pepper field right next
to the seed production

831
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,481
has been infested with aphids!

832
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,775
Tell them to get out there
and do pest control right now.

833
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,236
No, I just got a call from them.

834
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,529
Everyone on the Crop Team

835
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,780
-has been hospitalized.
-What?

836
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,908
-Food poisoning from a team dinner.
-What?

837
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:55,037
What did they eat to get
food poisoning at a time like this?

838
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,247
-What about the agricultural temp agency?
-Yes!

839
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,624
-Well--
-All hands on deck due to blight.

840
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,250
They won't have anyone free
until next week.

841
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,085
That's too late!

842
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,171
All the seed potatoes
will be ruined by then!

843
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:07,883
What do we do?

844
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,554
All of you.

845
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,269
Get your boots.

846
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:23,315
Pardon?

847
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,984
-Come on, Mr. Bu!
-Now.

848
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,694
-Mr. Bu, please!
-Right now?

849
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,196
-Mr. Bu.
-Why are you doing this?

850
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:32,282
-Let's go. Here, hurry.
-Yes.

851
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,827
Ms. Jjeon. Do Gyewang-ri tomorrow

852
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,704
and come help us first.
It's an emergency.

853
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,456
Yes, that much hose reel should be enough.

854
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,166
Could a few of you come help out?

855
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,668
We're running short on people. Okay.

856
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,419
What seems to be the problem?

857
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:53,804
You're in good shape, aren't you?

858
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,389
Pardon?

859
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,310
-Come with me.
-Oh my.

860
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,396
-I only have one arm in.
-Then drive.

861
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,898
Thank goodness, we got one more person.

862
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,402
Come on, this isn't right.

863
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,945
-Go!
-Go, go!

864
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,571
Oh my God.

865
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,118
-Hey, Hee-dong.
-I'm so sick and tired of this.

866
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,207
Hey, MK, MK.

867
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,458
-Hey, thank you.
-Careful.

868
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,210
Okay.

869
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,672
-All right, hurry up!
-Yes, sir!

870
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,116
Put these on.

871
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,201
We have to get this done before sundown.

872
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,496
I told you, I don't know
how to do stuff like this.

873
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,541
Do you think I had a pickax
in my hand from day one?

874
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,168
You learn out of necessity.

875
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,627
Come on, we don't have time.

876
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,047
Shouldn't you first explain
why I'm being forced

877
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,214
to do this job?

878
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,467
Is this so urgent that I had to be

879
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,926
dragged away from my duties?

880
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,095
I cannot believe the day has come

881
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,139
for me to explain to the chief
of the potato lab

882
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,850
the importance
of seed potato pest control.

883
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,809
Yes.

884
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,604
It is so very urgent
and so very important.

885
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,232
This isn't just any potato field.
This is where we grow seed potatoes.

886
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,651
The seeds grown here
go all over the country

887
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,487
and form the base of a year's harvest.

888
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,447
Imagine a disease
spreading through them.

889
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,032
What do you think will happen?

890
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,744
It will significantly impact the supply
of seed potatoes and potato output.

891
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,621
You're a quick learner.

892
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,872
Here. Come on.

893
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,962
But do we really have to dress like that?

894
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,302
Is your outfit really
the biggest concern right now?

895
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,096
I really don't like loud colors.

896
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,476
Oh, that jerk.

897
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,786
Wait, Ms. Kim!

898
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,622
Should Mr. So be doing that
without wearing any PPE?

899
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:29,417
Believe me, I tried talking to him.
But that's what he prefers, apparently.

900
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,974
What in the world is he doing?

901
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,642
Chief!

902
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,353
You have to walk backwards! Backward!

903
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,646
What? Backward?

904
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,982
-You need to go backwards.
-Backward.

905
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,734
INPUT
BACKWARD! TURN AROUND

906
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:55,986
OUTPUT
BACKWARD!

907
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,654
Oh! Backward!

908
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:05,996
No, wait, not that way.

909
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,757
Oh, you're going to crash! Oh no!

910
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,722
What are you two doing?

911
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,974
Jeez, I knew it, I knew it.

912
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,435
-Are you all right?
-Come on, Mr. So!

913
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,228
-Oh, Mr. Ko.
-I can't believe this.

914
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,038
Mr. So.

915
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,585
-Mr. Bu, look at them.
-Mr. Ko, stop playing!

916
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,628
My apologies.

917
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,550
-Okay, wait.
-Help us!

918
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,178
What a mess.

919
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,138
All right, focus. Focus.

920
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,155
Nothing's coming out!

921
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:25,867
Hey!

922
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:27,786
Excuse me!

923
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,537
Hey!

924
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,998
It's not coming out!

925
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,127
-What?
-It's not coming out!

926
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,255
-Stop? Stop?
-Yes, it's not coming out.

927
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,006
Okay.

928
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:45,637
REEL IN

929
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:49,599
Oh man. Hey!

930
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:57,607
-No, stop! Help him!
-What's going on?

931
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:58,608
Mr. Ko!

932
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,329
-Stop!
-Stop!

933
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,831
-Stop!
-Come on!

934
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,040
Hey, man!

935
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:15,292
-Stop!
-Stop!

936
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:19,129
-Come on, what is this?
-Hey, man!

937
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,236
Those few rounds around the field

938
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,196
made my joints ache.

939
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:46,990
I used to be able

940
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,700
to carry a boulder on my back

941
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,911
and run up that mountain back there.

942
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,580
Don't lie.

943
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,416
Every year feels so different.

944
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,461
What's taking the chief so long?
Didn't he go with you?

945
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,964
He waited until the end
because he wanted to shower by himself.

946
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:04,966
But you know,

947
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,635
it's a missed opportunity.

948
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,804
I wanted to see how much he's worked out.

949
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,848
Why would you want to see that?

950
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,351
Does your wife know?

951
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,062
That you're interested
in other men's bodies?

952
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,356
Can't you just see it
as a healthy interest

953
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,524
toward a coworker?

954
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,361
Take interest in your own body.

955
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,404
Go and get him already.

956
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,615
He kept falling over everywhere.

957
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,409
If he's passed out somewhere,
we have to file a report.

958
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,580
MK, you know you're the youngest, right?

959
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,335
You know what, I'll--

960
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,379
Jeez, okay. I'll go.

961
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,714
You don't have to pressure me like that.

962
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,049
Really, I could go.

963
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,732
Come out already!

964
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,114
There are wild boars nearby.
Don't hang out here.

965
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,827
Did he really pass out?

966
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,081
Excuse me!

967
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:21,459
I'm coming in. Okay?

968
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,671
I'm really coming in!

969
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,259
Yes.

970
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,501
THE HOT DIRECTOR

971
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:04,794
The hot…

972
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,838
director?

973
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:15,054
I WANT BAEK-HO

974
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:22,145
You are bound to fall for So Baek-ho.

975
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:34,991
What is it?

976
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:37,660
They…

977
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,082
They're all waiting for you.

978
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,251
Hurry up.

979
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,677
I couldn't hear a thing, that's why.

980
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,721
When flies land to eat food…

981
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:59,015
Why's Ms. Kim over there?

982
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,059
She is more contemplative than she looks.

983
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,561
-They spread the poison--
-That's quite enough.

984
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,271
Chung-hyeon, Chung-hyeon!

985
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,233
Then they suck the juice out.

986
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,486
For heavens' sake.
Just swat the flies away.

987
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,570
They suck it out.

988
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,572
They melt the food and suck out the juice.

989
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,784
-So what is this? Is it a fly?
-Mr. So.

990
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:19,953
Welcome.

991
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,621
Oh goodness me.

992
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,000
Thank you for all your work today.

993
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,836
I'm sure it was rough work
for your first week.

994
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,631
It was all right.
Thank you for your hard work.

995
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,466
Have a seat.

996
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,718
You need to have some makgeolli
after you spray pesticide

997
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,470
to flush out
all the toxins in your body.

998
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,806
Where did you even hear such nonsense?

999
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:43,434
-From my grandpa.
-Wise words from decades of experience.

1000
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,397
What do you want to do?
We plan to rest here for a bit, then go.

1001
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,982
You can join us if you'd like.

1002
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,402
How could someone as classy as Mr. So

1003
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,612
hang out with us? He would never.

1004
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,407
You'll be leaving, right?

1005
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,662
As your boss,

1006
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,873
I have a duty to encourage
and boost morale and teamwork.

1007
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,500
I'll join.

1008
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,793
-Sure.
-All right.

1009
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:10,795
Have a seat.

1010
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,297
-Have a seat there.
-Have a seat.

1011
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,676
-Mr. Bu.
-Yes.

1012
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,386
-Let me pour you a cup.
-Oh gosh.

1013
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,388
Thank you.

1014
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,266
Let me pour you one too.

1015
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,311
Are you okay

1016
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,479
with alcohol, though?

1017
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,024
I'm not that--

1018
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,568
Hey, if you can't drink,
you don't have to stay.

1019
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,572
Our team drank with the farmers
all the time, so they drink a lot.

1020
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,699
If you drink with us, you might pass out.

1021
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,659
I was going to say, I'm not sure.

1022
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:43,286
I've never been drunk before.

1023
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,373
-Then I'll pour you some more.
-That's great news!

1024
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,417
Then we won't hold back.

1025
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,627
Sure.

1026
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,088
-Good work today!
-Good work today!

1027
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,139
One, two, three!

1028
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,769
-Mr. Ko.
-One, two, three.

1029
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,437
I knew it!

1030
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,565
Mr. Ko.

1031
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,651
You're in trouble now.

1032
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,071
-Hey.
-Hi!

1033
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,697
-Hello.
-Hello!

1034
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:24,077
I can't believe him!
Passing out in front of his teammates.

1035
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:25,912
Honey.

1036
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,289
Darling?

1037
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,124
Pull yourself together.

1038
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,295
Ko Jung-hae!

1039
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,592
Yes, good work today, everyone.

1040
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,219
Don't be late tomorrow.

1041
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,137
Yes. Honey, let's go.

1042
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,347
Mr. Ko.

1043
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,140
Yo, MK.

1044
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,183
Right.

1045
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,935
-Goodness. Come on.
-Yes, honey.

1046
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,228
You're so embarrassing.

1047
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,271
-Give me the car keys.
-The car keys…

1048
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,357
-Here they are.
-Goodness.

1049
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,067
-Goodbye.
-Drive safely!

1050
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,360
Yes, bye-bye.

1051
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,989
You should head home too, Ms. Kim.

1052
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:03,616
We're on night duty today.

1053
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,993
-Okay.
-But what about Mr. So?

1054
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,790
You're something else, Ms. Kim.

1055
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,793
You got him wasted
when he'd never been drunk before.

1056
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,587
Not my fault he didn't realize
he was drunk.

1057
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,133
I'm fine, so I'll send him home.

1058
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,467
You head back.

1059
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,303
-Really? Okay!
-Okay, have a good day.

1060
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:37,859
Damn it.

1061
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,873
Designated driver…

1062
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,771
Oh dear.

1063
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,440
Damn it.

1064
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:29,035
Damn, how in the hell
does he look so dangerous?

1065
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,246
Damn it.

1066
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,055
Where did this come from?

1067
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,224
Gosh.

1068
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,601
Jeez.

1069
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,189
Damn it.

1070
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,506
You've arrived.

1071
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,678
Oh my goodness.

1072
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,514
Goodbye, thank you!

1073
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:56,372
Hey.

1074
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,587
Damn it.

1075
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,049
Mr. So Baek-ho.

1076
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:52,553
THE HOT DIRECTOR

1077
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,639
The hot…

1078
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,100
director?

1079
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:05,024
I'M BAEK-HO

1080
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,556
POTATO LAB

1081
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,393
TAMING THE COUNT - TAMING THE HOT DIRECTOR

1082
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,020
I have to go with the director.

1083
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:44,814
MI-KYUNG'S FAVORITE
ROMANCE NOVEL BOOK COVER

1084
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,149
You're all about looks, aren't you?

1085
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,860
But isn't the male lead a little weird?

1086
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,612
Why does that matter?

1087
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,781
Hey, if I were the female lead,

1088
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,533
the moment I saw a man with his looks,

1089
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:57,660
I'd kiss the hell out of him!

1090
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,914
And then, "Oh, hot director?"

1091
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,457
"Oh, right now?"

1092
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,042
"Oh no, I can't."

1093
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,877
"No, you can! Rip!"

1094
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,754
And I'll rip!

1095
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:09,797
Rip off everything!

1096
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,636
What do you think?

1097
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,950
But why? Why?

1098
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,453
In a way, this counts as punching him.

1099
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,621
Hey, be quiet!

1100
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,707
Don't we have something to discuss?

1101
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,210
Where's Ms. Kim?

1102
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,629
It seems like he's torturing her,

1103
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,173
but he's actually helping her.

1104
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,174
Parking!

1105
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,301
Can you cook?

1106
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,430
I'll just get right to it.

1107
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,767
I'm officially asking.
Will you go out with me?

1108
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,898
