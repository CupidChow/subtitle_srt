EPISODE 3
THE PRICE OF A KISS

3
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,856
Jeez.

4
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,751
Ow, my neck.

5
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,138
I almost called the National
Forensic Service for an autopsy.

6
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,224
How much booze does it take for someone

7
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,976
to mistake a bathtub for a bed?

8
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,644
I would love to know.

9
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,563
Don't start with me. It's too early.

10
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,733
Is that kimchi soup?

11
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,568
I just made some. Serve yourself.

12
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,195
How about some steamed eggs
while you're at it?

13
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,951
Okay, I get it. I got greedy.

14
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,287
I'm going to the village hall.

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,205
How rude.

16
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,791
Oh man, heartburn.

17
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,446
Good morning, sunshine.

18
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,489
Gosh, you scared me!

19
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,909
What? Why are you up already?

20
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,246
I just wanted to know
if my friend slept well

21
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,166
or if she had any dreams.

22
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,086
Just checking in on you.

23
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,923
I actually did have a strange dream.

24
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,510
I was living with
an annoying childhood friend.

25
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,761
Well…

26
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,555
Think harder.

27
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,894
Maybe you had a sweet dream
where you were doing certain things

28
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,147
with a certain someone?

29
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,983
What? Why would I dream…

30
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,154
What do you mean?

31
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,378
Ong-ju, did I tell you last night--

32
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,380
I saw you.
You and Ward B kissed, didn't you?

33
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,425
You did. Kim Mi-kyung
and So Baek-ho kissed!

34
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,177
-K-I-S-S-E-D!
-Hey, be quiet!

35
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,554
Hwan-kyung might hear you.

36
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,098
-You kissed!
-Okay, okay!

37
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,725
I'll tell you everything.

38
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,643
-I'll spill.
-You promise?

39
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,978
Yes!

40
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,689
Why'd you spit on my hand?

41
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,691
How did you…

42
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,904
How did you see that?

43
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,949
I told you. Sometimes…

44
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,577
I can read your mind.

45
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,914
The Hot Director?

46
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,889
Since I have perfect vision

47
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,559
and excellent hearing,
I experienced it in 4D.

48
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,685
Spill the tea.

49
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,604
Tell me everything leading up to the kiss

50
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,981
in order and in detail.
Don't leave anything out.

51
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,191
-I need the scoop.
-Stop.

52
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,692
There's nothing to tell.

53
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,319
I was drunk and out of my mind.

54
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,030
If you hooked up with a guy
every time you were drunk,

55
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,949
you would have 3,000 exes
and at least 12 children.

56
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,284
Am I supposed to believe that?

57
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,536
Are you saying it was just the booze?

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,829
Yeah, booze.

59
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,165
Besides, I can't stand the guy.

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,292
I promised myself,
"Sooner or later, I'll smack him."

61
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,253
I've been waiting for it, and…

62
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,464
In a way, this counts as smacking him.

63
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,424
I just happened to smack him on the lips,

64
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,384
with my…

65
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,303
lips.

66
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,223
Gosh, what was I thinking?

67
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,683
You realized that's complete bullshit
as you were saying it.

68
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,976
Of course I did.

69
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,770
Am I insane?

70
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,188
Why the hell did I kiss him?

71
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,191
My friend.

72
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,068
My beautiful, intelligent,

73
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,363
yet slightly less insightful friend.

74
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,864
I'll tell you why.

75
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,700
There are three things
that primates just can't keep inside.

76
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,285
Sneezes, burps,

77
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,620
-and--
-What? Love?

78
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,121
-Horniness.
-Stop!

79
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,791
I understand that you're confused,
but you have to admit it.

80
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,876
You've been living
a simple life in the mountains,

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,461
up to your ears in potatoes.

82
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,463
And suddenly,
you lose your last brain cell

83
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,048
and kiss your boss.

84
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,884
That can only be explained

85
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,178
by your libido controlling you.

86
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,763
Your body…

87
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,849
is attracted to So Baek-ho.

88
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,976
Did that help you understand?

89
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,228
No, and I don't want to understand.

90
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,980
I hate every word that you just said.

91
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,190
I wish I couldn't hear them!

92
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,316
Man!

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,402
You're the one who fed me all that

94
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,487
"The Hot Director" nonsense.

95
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,822
I hate you.

96
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,241
-Mi-kyung.
-What?

97
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,035
You can get mad all you want,
but you still have to tell me.

98
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,203
How was it?

99
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,540
Was it a PG-13 kiss? A light peck?

100
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,419
Or did it feel like
your souls were merging?

101
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,504
Do you know what I'm saying?

102
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,265
What on earth was I thinking?

103
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,041
SO FROM WARD B

104
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,297
I'm sorry. Deeply, deeply sorry.

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,007
I must've been crazy last night.

106
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,676
I'M SORRY! DEEPLY, DEEPLY SORRY!
I MUST'VE BEEN CRAZY LAST NIGHT!

107
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,094
No, that's not it.

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,809
Dear Mr. So, my deepest apologies.

109
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,686
Last night's unfortunate events

110
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,356
were entirely due to my negligence…

111
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,031
Did you sleep well?

112
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,409
I must've startled you last night.

113
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,375
Damn it!

114
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,170
What am I going to do?

115
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,731
DIRECTOR SO BAEK-HO

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,528
I really hope…

117
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,073
you don't remember.

118
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,965
11 HOURS AGO

119
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,155
Good night.

120
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,132
It's fine.

121
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,509
Go inside.

122
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,303
Go sleep.

123
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,875
But why? Why?

124
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,753
Why?

125
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,923
Why?

126
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,677
Why?

127
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,871
Oh, gosh.

128
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,798
-Hello?
-Why aren't you here?

129
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,134
Don't you know
that Mr. Byun is counting on us?

130
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,595
If we mess up,
he'll hold a grudge for three years!

131
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,554
Okay.

132
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,598
I'm trying my best to get ready.

133
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,809
Why would you drink so much
the night before--

134
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,900
How annoying.

135
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,035
You've got to be kidding me.

136
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,203
Gosh.

137
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,747
I'm coming down, you idiot.

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,749
-Don't make me punch--
-Ms. Kim.

139
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,258
SO FROM WARD B

140
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,096
Ms. Kim?

141
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,723
Oh, come on.

142
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,110
ASSISTANT MANAGER KIM MI-KYUNG

143
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,988
SO FROM WARD B

144
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,199
-The person you're trying to reach…
-What was that?

145
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,701
…is not available. Please leave a message…

146

…is not available.
Please leave a message after the beep…

148
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,192
It's too bright.

149
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,740
Oh, gosh.

150
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,756
Damn it.

151
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,844
Ms. Kim.

152
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,639
Damn it.

153
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,864
Damn it.

154
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,998
Hello, Mr. So.

155
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,458
Good morning.

156
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,419
Do you usually go in and out
through the window like this?

157
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:58,880
I do.

158
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,882
Back when I was in school,

159
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,967
I used to sneak out
without my parents knowing.

160
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,052
It's nostalgic for me.

161
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,379
What's a person like you
doing in a nice place like this?

162
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,005
Don't we have something to discuss?

163
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,507
Discuss?

164
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,347
Last night.

165
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,400
I never thanked you.

166
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,944
I blacked out last night
and don't remember a thing.

167
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,696
When I opened my eyes, I was home.

168
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,617
Thank you for getting me home safe.

169
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,093
You really don't remember anything?

170
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,637
No, absolutely nothing. Not even a bit.

171
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,348
It's like I put my brain
in the washing machine.

172
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,642
My memory is completely gone.

173
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,812
Did I…

174
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,315
do something so terrible

175
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,402
that you couldn't forgive me?

176
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,031
No.

177
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,408
You didn't.

178
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,660
That's good to know.

179
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,997
Then I hope you have a great weekend.

180
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,878
When can I expect you to pay me back?

181
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,471
You didn't have money on you,

182
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,389
so you borrowed some
to hire a designated driver.

183
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,348
Fifty thousand won.

184
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,225
Me?

185
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,769
I borrowed money from you?

186
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,521
Yes, but of course…

187
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,233
you don't remember.

188
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,616
Well…

189
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,993
Did I?

190
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,456
If I borrowed money from you,
I should definitely pay you back.

191
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,625
-And 120,000 won for gas.
-Sorry?

192
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,834
We ran out on the way.

193
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,545
You were too drunk,

194
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,214
so I paid for gas.

195
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,549
It was 120,000 won.

196
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,676
We stopped for gas?

197
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,886
And you got a full tank?

198
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,930
Yes, but of course…

199
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,681
you wouldn't remember.

200
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,644
That can't be right.

201
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,812
I hate owing people,

202
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,439
so even when I'm completely wasted,

203
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,399
I never borrow money.

204
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,693
-I don't think I would have.
-I'm certain.

205
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,529
Unlike you, Ms. Kim,

206
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,531
I didn't forget a second of what happened.

207
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,908
I remember everything clearly.

208
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,832
Well, okay.

209
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:27,129
It looks like I owe you for last night.

210
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,715
Enter your account number here.

211
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,935
-170,000 won?
-Yes, 170,000 won.

212
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,479
CONFIRM TRANSFER
170,000 WON, SO BAEK-HO

213
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,191
TRANSFER 170,000 WON TO SO BAEK-HO?

214
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,654
What are you doing here?

215
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,614
Oh, hey! Just who we needed.

216
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,950
So guess what?

217
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,120
The toilet in Ward B is so clogged
that it won't flush at all.

218
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,204
What do we do?

219
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,374
Really? That's never happened before.

220
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,751
Right? I guess he took
an exceptionally big dump.

221
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,963
Gosh, I wonder what he's been eating.

222
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,133
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes, Mr. So.

223
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,052
You can discuss maintenance issues
with the owner.

224
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,597
And I recommend
you see a proctologist, too.

225
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,058
Oh, gosh. I'm so busy.

226
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,065
So, should I unclog it for you?

227
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,771
SUNNYEO FOOD
COMPANY PROMOTION VIDEO.MP4

228
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,732
What is she doing with potatoes
when she majored in history?

229
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,484
Potatoes…

230
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,610
-are science.
-Are science.

231
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,284
STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

232
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,744
Come in.

233
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,579
Mr. Park.

234
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,458
Yes, what's up?

235
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,211
What you asked for.

236
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,005
Oh, right.

237
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,134
Why did you need info
on the potato lab all of a sudden?

238
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,178
It's because of Mr. So.

239
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,555
I feel bad for sending him so far away.

240
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,599
I thought I'd take a look
and share my thoughts.

241
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,894
But Mr. So is way more
professional at managing…

242
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,524
By the way, this lab is bizarre.

243
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,401
Why? Are they doing something weird?

244
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,069
Yes, they are.

245
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,114
They're a lab,
but they're having a cooking contest.

246
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,281
A cooking contest?

247
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,583
POTATO COOKING CONTEST BY SUNNYEO FOOD

248
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,722
-Hey.
-Hello.

249
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,558
-Hello, there.
-USB!

250
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,642
Hello.

251
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,602
Environment Kim. Yeah, wow.

252
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,231
-Wow, wow.
-Princess Lee!

253
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,691
Oh, no!

254
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,529
-Representing Youngeul-ri again?
-Of course.

255
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,114
By the way, Mr. Ko.

256
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,492
How do you keep looking younger
every time I see you?

257
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,077
Hey, stop it.

258
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,787
I just changed my hair color

259
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,290
from cool brown to muted brown.

260
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,958
-I see.
-Come on.

261
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,294
You're just dyeing gray hair.
Big difference.

262
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,129
She's just sucking up to the judge.

263
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,672
Hey! Gray hair?

264
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,924
I changed it after
my personal color analysis.

265
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,427
That's right. What do you know
about the subtle world of colors?

266
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,386
Jeez.

267
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,346
Be quiet so you don't lower our score.

268
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,683
Jeez, I'm all alone here.

269
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,726
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

270
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,852
-Bye.
-See you soon.

271
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,936
All right.

272
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,897
Follow me.

273
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,400
-Let's go.
-All right.

274
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,790
Do they pay you?

275
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,041
THE POTATO LAB

276
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,001
POTATO COOKING CONTEST BY SUNNYEO FOOD

277
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,295
The lab?

278
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,381
That's good.

279
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,301
Very good.

280
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,303
-Okay, good.
-Mr. Bu.

281
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,096
Yes?

282
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,725
You said that Chief So doesn't know
about today's event, right?

283
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,813
If he were here, he'd ask,
"Who's paying for this?"

284
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,148
"What is this for?"
It would give me a headache.

285
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,901
Then you're going to get a headache.

286
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,694
What are you talking about…

287
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,116
-Oh my! Chief!
-What?

288
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,287
-Hello, Chief.
-Please understand.

289
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,623
This cooking competition
has been in the works

290
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,292
since before the merger,
when we were still Sunnyeo Food.

291
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,670
The preparations
were already made a long time ago.

292
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,673
Not a single penny
from Wonhan's pocket went into this.

293
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,633
I hope you understand--

294
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,510
I read it in the budget report.

295
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,053
It's the lab's annual event.

296
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,638
Where's Ms. Kim?

297
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,933
Not telling you
was my call, not Ms. Kim's.

298
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,893
This is the last event

299
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,562
we're hosting as Sunnyeo Food.

300
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,397
All we do is physical labor--

301
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,774
I understand. Where's Ms. Kim?

302
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,943
We would never dream
of going over your head.

303
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,988
We thought that you'd be
exhausted from yesterday,

304
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,781
so we just wanted you to get some rest.

305
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,741
Okay, you've told me what I need to know.

306
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,952
So where is Ms. Kim?

307
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,662
Why are you looking for her?

308
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,956
She's a contestant, so she went that way.

309
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,416
That way?

310
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,671
Also…

311
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,884
The lab's research data
is Wonhan's property.

312
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,177
Lock up all buildings
except for the Admin

313
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,387
and control visitor access.

314
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,723
And designate a person
in charge of safety.

315
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,891
Establish a security system.

316
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,351
It's linked to the leakage
of confidential info.

317
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,478
What system?

318
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,231
-What…
-That's it?

319
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,567
Does he…

320
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,611
not realize that
we didn't want him here?

321
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,739
I feel like Chief So is leaving us out.

322
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,408
JUDGES
JU SEUNG-HEE, KO JUNG-HAE

323
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,993
GOLD, ENCOURAGEMENT AWARD, BRONZE

324
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,202
SILVER, PARTICIPATION AWARD

325
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,378
-Okay.
-Three.

326
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,549
Okay.

327
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,387
That little…

328
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,937
Do you seriously expect us
to recreate this?

329
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,855
Why are you so extra?

330
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,106
Hey!

331
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,900
You're just a maid.
How dare you speak to me?

332
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,151
Shut that mouth!

333
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,487
There he goes
role-playing like an idiot.

334
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,697
Get up and work, you idiot.

335
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,866
-Yeah, you idiot.
-Ms. Kim?

336
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,951
What?

337
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,827
YOUNGEUL-RI

338
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,750
What? How did you get here?

339
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,751
On your truck.

340
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,628
-Sorry?
-The 170,000 won.

341
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,046
I need it back now.

342
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,467
-No.
-Why not?

343
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,469
-I'm busy.
-Doing what?

344
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,389
I have two jobs here today.

345
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,807
I have to assist the chef

346
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,393
and run the event
as an employee of the hosting company.

347
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,520
A director from Wonhan
such as you wouldn't know it,

348
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,772
but this is what a worker's life is like.

349
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,533
You can work on paying me back
while I help with this.

350
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,493
Hold on. Hey, wait!

351
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,123
Do you even know what that's for?

352
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,471
Wow.

353
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,644
POTATO COOKING CONTEST BY SUNNYEO FOOD

354
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,279
What's happening?

355
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,074
What's going on?

356
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,118
How long has he had
professional magic hands?

357
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,876
170,000 won.

358
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,003
WORKED FOR 22 MONTHS
AT A HUGE KOREAN RESTAURANT

359
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,173
Well, that was a good start.

360
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,176
I have to prepare the tableware
for the contestants.

361
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,059
WORKED FOR 14 MONTHS AT A HOTEL BUFFET

362
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,647
170,000 won.

363
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,648
What?

364
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,862
Not yet, I have to…

365
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,988
You know.

366
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,740
That's right! Parking!

367
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,492
I have to help with parking.

368
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:22,915
THE POTATO LAB

369
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,675
WORKED FOR EIGHT MONTHS
AS AN AMUSEMENT PARK PARKING ATTENDANT

370
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,194
170,000 won!

371
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,405
I'm getting sick of this.

372
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,916
Oh my.

373
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,210
Okay.

374
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,462
Gosh.

375
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,341
If you say 170,000 won again,
I swear I'm going to punch you.

376
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,594
Hey!

377
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,597
170,000 won.

378
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,228
Oh my gosh.

379
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,065
That's not a person, it's a parrot.

380
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,317
Jeez.

381
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,821
All right.

382
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,452
This is weird.
It seems like he's torturing her,

383
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,288
but he's actually helping her.

384
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,083
It's expert torture and help
at the same time,

385
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,543
blurring the line between them.

386
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,587
It's like being passive-aggressive.

387
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,090
Does that mean he's just dumb?

388
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,134
He thinks he's winning, but he's not.

389
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,302
Sort of like…

390
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,803
a doormat?

391
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,681
-A doormat.
-A doormat.

392
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,183
Wow, wonderful weather.

393
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,101
Yes, the weather's great this year.

394
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,353
Is everything going well?

395
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,772
-Hello.
-Hello.

396
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,066
Yes! As Youngeul-ri's
first scholarship holder,

397
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,985
I'm ready to avenge last year's loss!

398
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,528
-All right.
-We trust you.

399
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,071
In order for you to be here,

400
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,282
it cost three months' worth
of cooking school tuition.

401
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,783
-Don't you forget that.
-I won't.

402
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,037
Good luck.

403
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,622
SOLSEON-RI, JANGSAN-RI

404
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,583
Hey, Byun Chang-sik.

405
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,712
Wow, you've got to respect
Youngeul-ri's persistence.

406
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,217
You never win,
but you still participate every year.

407
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,678
Shouldn't they give you an award
for perfect attendance?

408
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,055
Whoa.

409
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,058
That award should go to you, Choi.

410
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,769
Lost the county governor's seat
three years in a row,

411
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,691
yet you're still trying
to make it in politics.

412
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,564
-That's right.
-Whoa!

413
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,110
Whatever. Say hi.

414
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:00,697
This is my nephew, Chris Choi.

415
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,866
-Nephew?
-Oh please! Chris Choi?

416
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,743
What kind of name is that for a Korean?

417
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,954
He's spent so much time overseas

418
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,372
that he goes by Chris Choi now.

419
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,707
Do you know the Benton Hotel in Gangnam?

420
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,585
He's a chef there.

421
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,129
Wait a minute. He's a hotel chef?

422
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,757
-In this contest?
-That's not fair.

423
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,300
This is only for the locals.

424
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,718
-That's right.
-Anyway!

425
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:25,347
Give us a big hand when we win later.

426
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,890
-Yeah, right.
-Let's go!

427
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,350
That's right! Just go!

428
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,769
He's an angry little guy.

429
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,648
His dad used to be a servant at my house.

430
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,607
A servant.

431
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,608
Really?

432
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,859
A servant!

433
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,820
Your rice has been cooked.

434
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,154
-Hand that over.
-No, no.

435
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,656
-Mr. Byun, no!
-Oh my goodness.

436
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:44,825
-Oh, no!
-Wait.

437
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,576
-What?
-What are you doing?

438
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,537
-Mr. Byun!
-What is happening?

439
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,871
-You!
-Let go!

440
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,291
Why'd you have to bring up my dad?

441
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,500
-Why?
-Mr. Byun, calm down!

442
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,085
You're making a fool of yourself!

443
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,004
This just proves you're ignorant!

444
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,089
Right! And your dad
was such an educated man

445
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,300
that he was an informant for the Japanese!

446
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,343
Your family's wealth comes
from the Japanese,

447
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,138
and the whole Pyeongwon area knows it!

448
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,099
It comes from investing in land,
not the Japanese!

449
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,803
What do you think you're doing?

450
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:17,190
-Hey, let's just go!
-Let go!

451
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,734
Let go!

452
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,611
What is it? Are they playing a game?

453
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,821
Hey!

454
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:34,082
JANGSAN-RI

455
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,512
Hey, step back!

456
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,182
-Go away!
-Hey!

457
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,183
You!

458
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,934
Step back!

459
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,644
Quick! Stop them.

460
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,063
-Hey!
-Now!

461
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,564
That's enough.

462
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,274
I'm warning you! Stop it right…

463
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,279
-Oh no!
-Jeez!

464
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,834
Ouch!

465
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,337
SECURITY

466
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,421
Hey…

467
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,262
-There he is.
-Hold on.

468
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,597
Come on, tell him.

469
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,362
What is it?

470
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,115
Well…

471
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,618
You proved earlier
that you're a man of many talents.

472
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,829
Can you cook?

473
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,497
Define the ability to cook.

474
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,293
So…

475
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,295
You'd know how to cook kimchi fried rice.

476
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,798
You'd be capable
of hosting a housewarming party.

477
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,301
And you'd have experience in the field.

478
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,681
Multiple part-time kitchen jobs
and a military cook for 14 months.

479
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,891
I'm a licensed cook
in both Korean and Western cuisine

480
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,935
and also a licensed baker.

481
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,021
So I'd say I'm about here.

482
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,107
Wait!

483
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,985
Seoul Guy.

484
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,281
Come here.

485
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,581
Well, I mean…

486
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,630
I know that I'm not in a position
to ask you something like this.

487
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,259
But I'd appreciate it

488
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,636
if you'd represent our town
in the contest.

489
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,638
Me?

490
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,229
What happened?

491
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,814
Well…

492
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,984
He basically dunked his face
into a pool of diced onions.

493
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,153
Please, just this once.

494
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,821
For the honor of Youngeul-ri--

495
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,989
I won't.

496
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,407
What are you doing?

497
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,284
Win him over with part of the prize money.

498
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,120
Right, we'll split
the prize money in half--

499
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,039
I'll explain, since you don't understand.

500
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,541
First, I feel no sense of belonging
to Youngeul-ri.

501
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,627
Second, your hostility toward outsiders

502
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,338
has been making my life very inconvenient.

503
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,506
Third…

504
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,883
It was you, the village head, who told me

505
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,259
I don't deserve to live here.

506
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,887
So why would I go through all of this

507
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,680
just to defend the honor of Youngeul-ri?

508
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,848
For what reason?

509
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,146
Rite of passage.

510
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,733
You'll have the right to pass
through Mr. Byun's private property.

511
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,735
Isn't that a prize worth fighting for?

512
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,279
Right! That's an invaluable prize.

513
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,906
-Yes.
-That's right.

514
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,283
You can take a dump
in the middle of the street

515
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,536
if you just beat
those Jangsan-ri bastards!

516
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,834
What matters to me

517
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,379
-is not a rite of passage, it's--
-Principle!

518
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,674
So let's make sure everything's in order.

519
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,884
You're not bowing down to anyone here

520
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,220
and you're not violating any laws.

521
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,721
A rite of passage for your labor.

522
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,891
It's a transaction between two parties.

523
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,059
That's right.

524
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,531
The fact that I'm living in Youngeul-ri…

525
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,117
is confidential.

526
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,961
Could I borrow that?

527
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,879
Borrow what?

528
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,596
Is that a wig?

529
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:01,933
Wow.

530
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,103
Jangsan-ri! Jangsan-ri!

531
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,062
Let's go!

532
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,606
-Jangsan-ri!
-Hey!

533
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,107
-Jangsan-ri!
-Hey!

534
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,859
Jangsan-ri!

535
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,198
That was a wig?

536
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,327
I had no idea! Right?

537
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,163
-It looked so natural.
-Well…

538
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,957
All right, Jangsan-ri.

539
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,294
-No one can beat us.
-Of course not.

540
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,020
How's he doing that?

541
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,188
Is that possible?

542
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,356
BEST POTATO COOK CHRIS CHOI

543
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,413
-Whoa!
-Wow!

544
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,305
Whoa.

545
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,815
-All right!
-Let's go!

546
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,441
That's what I'm talking about!

547
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,510
ECO-FRIENDLY COOK KIM HWAN-KYUNG

548
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,762
YOUNGEUL-RI

549
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,332
-All right.
-Go, team!

550
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,835
-Let's go.
-That was good.

551
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,186
SNORT, LOL

552
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,272
What the…

553
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,324
Wow, what is he throwing in the air?

554
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,867
Is this a circus now?

555
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,870
That's strange.

556
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,997
-That guy.
-Yes.

557
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,208
He has the same figure as Mr. So.

558
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,128
Shoulders, arms, chest,
and the length of his legs.

559
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,548
How do you remember
different parts of a man's body so well?

560
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,591
What?

561
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,551
-Are you a butcher?
-Come on.

562
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,596
There's no way that arrogant Mr. So
would do something like that.

563
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,059
DUCHESS POTATOES

POTATO COOKING CONTEST

570
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,129
Dong!

571
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,089
SECURITY

572
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,425
We'll start from there.

573
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,802
-We'll be back soon.
-This way.

574
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,886
-Let's start here.
-Wow.

575
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,431
Wow, that's a lot of dishes.

576
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,724
Causa Re…

577
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,810
What does it say? Rellena.

578
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,020
What country is this from?

579
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,984
Causa rellena is
a traditional Peruvian potato dish.

580
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,902
It's an appetizer that's served cold.

581
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,487
You have a unique voice.

582
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,991
UGLY CHEESE POTATOES

583
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,951
What's this? "Ugly Cheese Potatoes"?

584
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,703
Is this also an entry?

585
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,581
This is a new dish made by Kim Mi-kyung.

586
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:35,540
I made it myself.

587
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,585
-I'll pretend I didn't see that.
-Yes.

588
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,170
Where are you going? Come on.

589
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,172
I noticed that the contestants

590
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,092
shoved the ugly potatoes to the side.

591
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,220
They might seem less appetizing
because of the way they look,

592
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,389
but they taste
just like the other potatoes.

593
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,725
As a potato lab researcher, I thought

594
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,226
that we should love all potatoes.

595
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,271
Furthermore, we should protect the Earth
by reducing food waste.

596
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,940
That's why I used the ugly potatoes--

597
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,275
Hey, MK.

598
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,486
Can you even tell salt from sugar?

599
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,821
Hey, not cool.

600
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,573
-Give me that.
-I don't want it.

601
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,070
-Just take one bite. Open wide.
-No.

602
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:11,609
-Say, "Aah."
-No!

603
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,245
How does it taste?

604
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,167
How is it?

605
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,379
No way.

606
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:24,923
It starts out crunchy,

607
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:28,301
then the silky mashed potatoes
fill my mouth.

608
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,429
And then a blanket of cheddar cheese
envelops my taste buds.

609
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,224
In the end, all the flavors
come together as one.

610
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,645
What's up with you?

611
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:40,772
We have a problem.

612
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,024
That thing…

613
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,486
is freaking delicious.

614
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,697
She can never know.

615
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,784
She's going to be bragging about it
for the next six months.

616
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,578
Thank you for this.

617
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,664
Hold on, at least take a bite

618
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,374
and then judge us.

619
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,043
It's really good.

620
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,468
It's good, right?

621
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,138
It's so smooth.

622
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,974
-Is it good?
-It is.

623
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,564
Oh, yes.

624
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,900
That was delicious.

625
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,110
-Thank you.
-Of course.

626
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,327
Great job, everyone.

627
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,955
As we tasted all the unique

628
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,166
and carefully prepared dishes,

629
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,878
we could truly feel the warmth

630
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,923
that our beloved Pyeongwon citizens

631
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,633
have in their hearts.

632
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,094
Also!

633
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,888
We at the potato lab…

634
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,599
TOO LONG

635
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,437
Anyway,

636
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,273
I hope you'll continue supporting

637
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,650
Korean potatoes in the future.

638
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,069
We will now announce the winners of…

639
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,530
The Potato Cooking Contest.

640
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,324
Drumroll please…

641
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,368
First, the Participation Award.

642
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,955
Drumroll please…

643
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,957
Please.

644
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,835
Jangsan-ri!

645
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,629
Come on!

646
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,131
What?

647
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,467
Oh my gosh!

648
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,803
That's last place. We beat Jangsan-ri!

649
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,432
-Did they announce the gold?
-Not yet.

650
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,017
Hey…

651
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,812
Why is Youngeul-ri happy about Jangsan-ri
getting the Participation Award?

652
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,898
Youngeul-ri and Jangsan-ri

653
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,150
only entered the contest
to beat each other.

654
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,029
Participation Award means
that Jangsan-ri is in last place.

655
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,323
Oh, I see!

656
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,326
Did we win?

657
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,872
Please settle down.

658
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,333
Youngeul-ri only won
the Recognition Award.

659
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,480
This is complete nonsense!

660
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:08,669
My nephew is a chef at a famous hotel,

661
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,444
and he only gets a Participation Award

662
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,506
in this little contest?

663
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,551
A famous hotel? Big deal.
Everything he made was greasy.

664
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:19,138
We're Korean.
We need at least one spicy dish!

665
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,349
That makes no sense!

666
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,894
Hey, how do you like Youngeul-ri now?

667
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,604
-You!
-You should've done better.

668
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,356
I swear there's a conspiracy here.

669
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,732
-Shut up!
-Hey!

670
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,691
Oh no.

671
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,819
Stop it, please!

672
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,363
We won!

673
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,281
We beat Jangsan-ri!

674
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,367
Seoul Guy, I love you.

675
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,039
I'm glad I lent you my hair.

676
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,253
We beat Jangsan-ri!

677
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,380
We won!

678
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,930
What are you doing? Get up.

679
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,269
I can't move a muscle.

680
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,647
Can you pick me up and throw me on my bed?

681
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,775
No. Spine surgery costs 30 million won.

682
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,110
When's Mi-kyung coming back?

683
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,572
No idea. You know how long
she likes to stay in the greenhouse.

684
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,907
She's fixing Ms. Hong's TV.

685
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:20,950
What?

686
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,786
-I thought she was at the greenhouse.
-What?

687
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,877
That sneaky thing!

688
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,096
Why are we--

689
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,639
In the middle of nowhere?

690
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,309
Don't get me wrong.

691
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,356
We're only here because there's someone
at the guesthouse who's delusional

692
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:51,564
and very invested in our story.

693
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,942
And if anyone in town saw
two unmarried people talking privately,

694
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,777
everyone would think we're in love.

695
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,447
Most importantly…

696
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,243
Beer tastes better
when you're drinking it here.

697
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,245
Enough of an answer?

698
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,837
Thank you for today.

699
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,340
For protecting Youngeul-ri's pride.

700
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,218
I only agreed to do it
for my own convenience.

701
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,930
Come on, I'm thanking you.
Wanna be smug? Now's your chance.

702
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:25,806
Jeez.

703
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,174
Okay.

704
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,802
I admit it… sorry.

705
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,221
When I said I didn't remember last night,

706
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,139
I was lying.

707
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,809
I was embarrassed,
so I wanted to pretend that I forgot.

708
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:13,271
But I realized it'd be more embarrassing
to run away from my mistakes.

709
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,563
Anyway.

710
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,400
I remember everything.

711
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,819
And I know that it's all my fault.

712
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,446
Say what you need to say.

713
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,908
I'll accept whatever
you have to say to me.

714
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,707
Ms. Kim.

715
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,501
Yeah, go on. Let it rip.

716
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,461
I'm asking officially.

717
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,256
Okay, let it officially rip.

718
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,634
Will you go out with me?

719
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,442
Wait.

720
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,236
So…

721
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,824
What…

722
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,117
What did you just say?

723
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,994
You heard me.

724
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,330
I did hear you.

725
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,874
But why?

726
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,959
Mr. So, do you like me?

727
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,128
-No.
-Then why?

728
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,505
Then why do you want to go out?

729
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,466
-Why would we date?
-We've kissed.

730
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,559
What…

731
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,019
I'm sorry, are you insane?

732
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,104
I've come to this conclusion
after much thought.

733
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,898
I don't think it's necessary
to call me that.

734
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,025
But what you're saying is crazy!

735
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,404
Wait a minute.

736
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:47,406
Was that your first kiss or something?

737
00:47:47,888 --> 00:47:49,492
Am I the first woman you've ever kissed?

738
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,785
-Am I?
-No, you're the third.

739
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,161
Whoa, don't tell me that!

740
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,496
I don't need to know that.

741
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,503
Hold on, I really want to try

742
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,505
and understand where you're coming from.

743
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,049
"We've kissed, so let's date."

744
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,927
How did you reach
that unreasonable conclusion in your head

745
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,013
before it came out of your mouth
and just put it out there?

746
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,556
Could you explain it to me, please?

747
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,101
It's not that complicated.
It's simple propositional logic.

748
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,353
Conditional statement P,
kissing is done between couples.

749
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,313
Q, Kim Mi-kyung and So Baek-ho kissed.

750
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,565
R, Kim Mi-kyung and So Baek-ho
are not a couple.

751
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,442
P implies Q,

752
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,486
but R contradicts P.

753
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,738
The three statements
are not simultaneously true…

754
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,370
It seems like you're not following at all.

755
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,371
I'm not.

756
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,166
I don't understand, and I don't want to.

757
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,709
This is the crappiest possible way

758
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,128
to confess your feelings.

759
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,463
As I mentioned,
I don't have feelings for you.

760
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,632
So this isn't a confession.

761
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,926
-It's more of a proposal--
-That's what I mean!

762
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,469
That's the craziest part.

763
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,221
It's like you're made of stainless steel.

764
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,600
Okay, you know what?

765
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,644
It'd be less crazy if you liked me.

766
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,522
If you said that you've liked me
since we first met,

767
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,983
then I might be able to understand.

768
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,861
But what? Propositional logic?

769
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,615
Are you really human? Be honest.

770
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,868
You eat batteries instead of food, right?

771
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,078
I'm the one who's perplexed.

772
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,496
I have strict distinctions

773
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,582
and boundaries in my relationships.

774
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,334
But because of your unpredictable
behavior last night,

775
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,919
my principles fell apart,

776
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,504
and now my life is blemished

777
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,799
by the fact that I kissed a coworker
with whom I am not in a relationship.

778
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,051
And that really…

779
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,386
bothers me.

780
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,347
So much so that I can't help
but want to rectify it.

781
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,348
"Blemished"?

782
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,520
I get it.

783
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,856
I'm like a big pimple on your life.

784
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,066
I'm so sorry a nasty creature like myself

785
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,027
dared to put my mouth on your pretty face.

786
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,695
I've committed a grave sin.

787
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:53,574
How disgusting
and filthy that must've felt!

788
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,493
I never said that I didn't like it.

789
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,296
If…

790
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,969
If it wasn't awful,

791
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,763
then good for you.

792
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,890
But I still don't approve

793
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,934
of your inhuman principles.

794
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,187
The situation is similar
to a fender-bender.

795
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,688
Yes, that's right.

796
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,733
It was a fender-bender
between certain parts of our faces.

797
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,444
I apologized and we settled, so it's over.

798
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,905
We're nowhere close to settling.

799
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,116
Because you're denying responsibility.

800
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,743
Responsibility…

801
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,043
Look, Mr. So.

802
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,836
Are you that traditional?

803
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,922
This is not the Joseon Dynasty.

804
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,257
I haven't been a virgin

805
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,925
for about ten years now.

806
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,262
We're two people in their thirties
and our lips touched for a second.

807
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,597
And you're talking about responsibility?

808
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,849
It was more than a second.

809
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,351
It was so a second!

810
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,228
In my opinion, that wasn't even a kiss.

811
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,771
It was a light peck.

812
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,148
Let's agree to disagree on that.

813
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,234
I want to hear your answer to my question.

814
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,196
I have been consistently saying no
from the very beginning.

815
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,073
Were you even listening?

816
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,578
I don't want to. No, never, "X"!

817
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,705
I am absolutely, completely opposed.

818
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,624
-And the reason?
-I hate everything about this!

819
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,627
I hate that you're asking me out
when you don't even like me.

820
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,922
And I also hate the way you brought it up.

821
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,383
Even if you bought me flowers

822
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,302
and got down on one knee,
I'd only say "maybe".

823
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,469
How are you so arrogant?

824
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,598
You hate the situation, not me.

825
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,434
That's your takeaway?

826
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,394
Why would you kiss someone you hate?

827
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,395
I would!

828
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,981
If someone I hated was super hot!

829
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,158
No.

830
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,119
Pretend you didn't hear that.

831
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,996
Do you think that I'm…

832
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,789
Just pretend you didn't hear it!

833
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,458
What the hell!

834
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,417
Anyway.

835
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,544
I was feeling guilty

836
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,296
for doing something crazy to you.

837
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,966
But now I see that we're both crazy.

838
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,095
Just know that I apologized to you
and gave you the chance to blame me.

839
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,513
Don't say I didn't.

840
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,223
I don't take back my decisions.

841
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,643
I'll make you like me.

842
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,394
And I'll make sure we become a couple.

843
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,520
I'll do my best.

844
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,358
You really are crazy.

845
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,903
I messed with a crazy person.

846
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,614
What kind of flowers do you like?

847
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,370
Korean Bugleweeds!

848
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,543
Booger…

849
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,133
Bugle…

850
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,594
Could you say that again?

851
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:06,975
Bugle…

852
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,062
Booger…

853
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,147
Bugle…

854
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,241
Oh my gosh. That was terrifying.

855
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,702
I've never met anyone crazier.

856
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,747
I never said that I didn't like it.

857
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:38,966
NOT AWFUL

858
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,975
What is wrong with me?

859
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,737
BUGLE

860
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,240
BUGLE FLOWER NAME

861
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,495
BUGLE FLOWER NAME

862
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,623
BUGLOSS

863
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,627
I would!

864
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,046
If someone I hated was super hot!

865
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,078
Hurry up!

866
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,206
We're here.

867
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:53,624
This is the place?

868
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,084
They really do eyebrow tattoos for free?

869
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,546
Not only is the microblading free,
but they pay you just for coming.

870
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,591
An event for young
Youngeul-ri residents under 50.

871
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,135
We need to take advantage
while we still can.

872
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,472
This place doesn't look legit at all.

873
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,433
Follow me, young people.

874
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,028
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Someone came for a haircut.

875
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,655
-I'll have you ready in a bit.
-Okay.

876
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,198
HAIR SALON

877
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,085
Excuse me, ma'am.

878
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,795
You do have a license, right?

879
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,797
Don't you worry.

880
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,175
I took the test three times

881
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,511
and practiced on pig skin a hundred times.

882
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,347
I'd count that as having a license.

883
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,267
You took the test three times?

884
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,978
Meaning you failed three times.

885
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,605
Okay, relax.

886
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:02,234
If you frown,
your brows will turn out uneven.

887
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,153
Actually…

888
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,114
Ma'am, I'm sorry,

889
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,992
but I have to go to work tomorrow.

890
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,911
Don't worry, it'll be unnoticeable.

891
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,330
Wait, please, ma'am!

892
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:16,957
This is an illegal procedure!

893
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,756
HAIR CHANCE

894
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,091
I know, right?

895
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,427
I didn't even eat that much,
but my pants wouldn't zip.

896
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,262
I couldn't breathe.

897
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,680
Who's that?

898
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,308
-MK?
-Good morning.

899
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,727
Is something wrong?
Do you have an eye infection?

900
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,562
You know her. Would she cover up

901
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,105
a facial condition this way?

902
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,399
Mi-kyung, be honest. It's okay.

903
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,568
Did you get into a fight over the weekend?

904
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,111
Did someone punch you in the face?

905
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,530
-Nothing like that.
-Good morning.

906
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,032
-Hello.
-Good morning.

907
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,366
-Hello.
-Hey.

908
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,243
-Hey, everyone.
-Mr. Bu.

909
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:58,081
What is this dragonfly
doing in our office?

910
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,543
Mi-kyung, did you get into a fight?

911
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:04,046
Why does everyone think that I…

912
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,923
There was a beauty-related issue.

913
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,217
That's all you need to know.

914
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,721
-Double eyelid surgery?
-That must be it.

915
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,140
-It's not--
-Whatever your eyes look like,

916
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,183
take them off.

917
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,478
Are you going to keep them on
all day while you're at work?

918
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,271
-It's okay, take them off.
-It's okay.

919
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,398
Let's take a look. It's just us.

920
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,359
-Yeah, what's that for?
-Show us.

921
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,027
-Let us see.
-It's okay, come on.

922
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,446
Drumroll please!

923
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,834
-Her eyebrows!
-Why?

924
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,379
-Why? What's wrong?
-Her eyebrows.

925
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,755
-Jeez!
-Look at them.

926
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,465
Oh my goodness!

927
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,927
Okay, laugh it up.

928
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,055
Life is hard enough.
I'm glad I can make you laugh.

929
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,306
This is why

930
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,517
people should stay in their lanes.

931
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,435
Look at what happens if you don't.

932
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,354
You know what, Ms. Kim? You're brave.

933
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,565
I would've been too embarrassed
to come to work.

934
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,109
Thank you so much for saying that.

935
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,485
Come on, people.

936
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,320
When your colleague is in this state,

937
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,864
-you should take a picture first.
-Oh, right.

938
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,992
Be prepared to be teased
about this forever.

939
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,451
Let's see here.

940
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,245
Come on, put them away.

941
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,622
Why are you doing this to me?

942
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,585
-Two, three.
-Smile!

943
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,753
Let me get in here.

944
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,715
All right.

945
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,522
Unnoticeable? Yeah, right!

946
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,859
These would be noticeable
from 100 meters away.

947
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,845
What? Haven't you ever seen someone
with tattooed eyebrows before?

948
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,847
Yes, I have.

949
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,142
Is that…

950
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,560
permanent?

951
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:25,812
Why?

952
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,939
Yesterday, you were
so desperate to go out with me.

953
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,442
But you don't want to date
someone who looks like this?

954
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,613
I'm just concerned for your dignity.

955
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,740
You look quite ridiculous at the moment.

956
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,742
Yes, thank you for your opinion.

957
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,787
I'll take care of my own dignity.

958
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,039
I really hope
you take care of your sanity.

959
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,545
By the way…

960
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,381
Those flowers you mentioned
are hard to find.

961
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:56,259
Are there any other ones that you like?

962
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,680
False goat's beard.

963
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,561
False goat's beard?

964
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,564
False…

965
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,819
False goat's beard?

966
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,580
-Ma'am.
-Hey.

967
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,582
When are you going pro?

968
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,959
We can't compete.

969
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,211
-Nonsense, you've improved.
-Have I?

970
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,130
I thought you buried yourself in work.

971
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,048
Looks like you've been
hitting the course too.

972
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,551
-Thank you.
-That's not all he's been doing.

973
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,344
He's probably been making connections

974
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,638
and enjoying being the Wonhan son-in-law.

975
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,766
Are you heading straight home
and not to the villa?

976
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,769
No, since I'm here in Gangwon-do,

977
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:49,062
I'd like to see Mr. So.

978
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,190
You want to visit the potato lab?

979
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,775
Why, do you have plans?

980
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,194
No, I don't.

981
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,195
Let's all go, then.

982
01:00:58,238 --> 01:00:59,156
Let's see

983
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,950
how hard they're studying these potatoes!

984
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,918
When we all went to Wonhan last time,

985
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,089
it would've been funny
if we'd all gotten our eyebrows tattooed.

986
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,424
Not me.

987
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,677
Mr. Bu! My goodness.

988
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,055
You're the Section Chief.
Have some dignity.

989
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,266
I don't care about dignity right now!

990
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,520
Go inside and put on deodorant.

991
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,690
The chairman is visiting the lab.

992
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,734
Which chairman are you talking about?

993
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,944
The chairman of the Youth Farmers Union
and the Senior…

994
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,279
No, no!

995
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,365
Not them. I meant the real chairman.

996
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,950
Of Wonhan Retail.

997
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,286
Chairman Wang!

998
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,080
-What?
-Chairman Wang?

999
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,172
What's happening?

1000
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,299
Even the CEO of Sunnyeo Food
has never visited.

1001
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,092
Why is Wonhan's chairman coming?

1002
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,595
Everyone, pile up
all the papers on your desks.

1003
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,722
-We need to look busy.
-We are busy.

1004
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:06,890
Look busier!

1005
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,100
Put all your effort into looking busy.

1006
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,519
What are you all doing?

1007
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:14,564
Those are a problem.

1008
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:16,483
Hide.

1009
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,216
Hello, Ms. Wang.

1010
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,718
Maybe it's the fresh air here,

1011
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,845
but you're looking even better.

1012
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,765
I'm from the research team.

1013
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,603
I'm Bu Jae-joong, General Manager.

1014
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,106
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

1015
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,859
The lab is smaller than I thought.

1016
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,988
-What's that?
-Oh, yes.

1017
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,287
How old is this lab?

1018
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,789
It's been thirty…

1019
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,457
-Thirty…
-Three…

1020
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,626
-Thirty years old?
-It's thirty-four years old.

1021
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,545
-Oh, thirty-four?
-Yes.

1022
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,755
-Wow, look at that scenery.
-Whoa.

1023
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,340
I guess it takes that kind of charisma

1024
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:24,301
to run a company worth trillions of won.

1025
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,261
The son-in-law is good-looking, too.

1026
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,595
-He is.
-Hey.

1027
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,806
Ms. Kim, come take a look.

1028
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,226
No thanks. I don't really care.

1029
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,645
Gangwon-do is quite warm…

1030
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,820
My goodness.

1031
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,906
You hid your employees
because the chairman was coming?

1032
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:53,204
You three, and the one on the side.

1033
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,372
Come down here!

1034
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,041
Come out!

1035
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,668
-We got caught.
-Gosh.

1036
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,211
She wants us to come down.

1037
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,588
What?

1038
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,924
When will you ever get the chance
to meet Wonhan's chairman again?

1039
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,718
Come here!

1040
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:09,596
Hello.

1041
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,431
Damn it.

1042
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,683
Ms. Kim.

1043
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:14,642
Man…

1044
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,897
Damn it.

1045
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,034
Oh, no.

1046
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,247
No.

1047
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,749
Oh my gosh.

1048
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,503
There they come.

1049
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:44,547
-Hello.
-Hello.

1050
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:45,924
Hello.

1051
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:47,759
Why just three?

1052
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:49,386
Ms. Kim!

1053
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,354
What's wrong with her?

1054
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,273
Is she not feeling well?

1055
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,572
Hello…

1056
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:22,961
Oh dear.

1057
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,883
I'm Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung.

1058
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:30,427
Okay.

1059
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,931
You leave a strong impression.

1060
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,020
-Shall we go inside?
-Let's do that.

1061
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:54,868
Gosh.

1062
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,119
Damn it.

1063
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:58,705
Jeez.

1064
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,421
We practice aeroponic farming here.

1065
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,423
This is where we grow seed potatoes.

1066
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:12,802
Wow, look at all these potatoes.

1067
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,722
How many would you say are in here?

1068
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,223
In all seven of the greenhouses,

1069
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,142
it adds up to about 40,000 potatoes.

1070
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,021
Taking care of all of them

1071
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,274
must not be an easy job.

1072
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,233
Oh my.

1073
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,986
Here, we have

1074
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,864
the seed potatoes
we plan on planting next year.

1075
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,700
We're developing a variety called Maroo,

1076
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,786
and of the hundreds and thousands
of potatoes from the last five years,

1077
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:42,582
we picked out the strongest
and prettiest ones.

1078
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,418
These are all seed potatoes?

1079
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:46,878
-Yes, ma'am.
-I see.

1080
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:50,006
Shall we head
to the cold storage warehouse?

1081
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,841
-Mr. Ko.
-Yes, sir.

1082
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,176
-Lead the way.
-This way, please.

1083
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,177
All right.

1084
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,971
It's a little chilly in there.

1085
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:58,890
It'll be nice and cool.

1086
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,731
-This way.
-Yes.

1087
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,525
Are you okay?

1088
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,571
Jeez.

1089
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,708
Damn it.

1090
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,013
I almost suffocated to death.

1091
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,390
What is going on?

1092
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,352
Why are your eyebrows like that?

1093
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,607
It's just so random

1094
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,859
that Kim Mi-kyung works at the potato lab.

1095
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,778
Why are you in Pyeongwon?

1096
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,864
I remember Hwan-kyung wanted
to move to the country.

1097
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,741
Did you all move down here?

1098
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:00,743
Did you?

1099
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,247
I get it.

1100
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,001
I have no right
to ask you all these questions.

1101
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,506
It does seem to be fate.

1102
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,634
Who knew we'd be working
at the same company again?

1103
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:22,557
Mi-kyung.

1104
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,935
This might be out of line,

1105
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,354
but let me ask you a favor.

1106
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,566
How do I put this?

1107
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:37,113
I'm not the Park Ki-se you used to know.

1108
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:40,366
My position in Wonhan is important
and people respect me.

1109
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,162
So I have to be cautious.

1110
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:47,290
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

1111
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,418
You're starting to annoy me.

1112
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,342
Act like you don't know me.

1113
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,178
What?

1114
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,096
Please don't tell anyone about us.

1115
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,348
I don't want people talking

1116
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,433
about what's in my past.

1117
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,478
Of course, you'll be compensated.

1118
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:11,481
If the work here is hard,
I could transfer you.

1119
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,608
-If you want a promotion--
-Compensated?

1120
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,109
Yes.

1121
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:16,986
Right.

1122
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,330
Don't worry, Mr. Park.

1123
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,624
I don't need to be compensated.

1124
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,960
I never want to talk about
what happened in the past anyway.

1125
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,673
I see.

1126
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,299
This was unnecessary.

1127
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,635
We're on the same page.

1128
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,981
You still use the same shampoo.

1129
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,950
What did you just say?

1130
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:08,329
-"You still use the same shampoo"?
-Yes.

1131
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,580
The same shampoo?

1132
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,499
You…

1133
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,668
-What?
-Get up, you jerk.

1134
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,545
-Mi-kyung!
-You!

1135
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,879
You subhuman piece of shit!

1136
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,215
Why do you remember
what my shampoo smells like?

1137
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,425
You stupid jerk!

1138
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:21,926
Mi-kyung, we're at work.

1139
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,053
So why did you have to
drag your bullshit in here?

1140
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:26,431
My shampoo? Go to hell.

1141
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:27,724
Don't even breathe near me!

1142
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,976
Hold your nose. No breathing, you bastard!

1143
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,853
Gosh! You're pissing me off!

1144
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,151
Oh, no. You fell down on your own.

1145
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,153
Maybe you have weak legs.

1146
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,908
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1147
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:47,910
I'm fine.

1148
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,496
Are you okay?

1149
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:53,875
Yes, I am.

1150
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,527
Things seem to be complicated down here.

1151
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:22,653
Does everyone work hard?

1152
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:25,198
Yes, the workers generally
have a good attitude.

1153
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,199
A good…

1154
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,079
Excuse me.

1155
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:35,333
It's not about attitude.
It's about results.

1156
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,668
I noticed that the budget
keeps increasing,

1157
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:38,795
but development is slow.

1158
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,671
In terms of HR practices,
there's no turnover,

1159
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,965
and individuals remain
in their positions indefinitely.

1160
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,676
I know you're on top of this,
but it seems almost hopeless.

1161
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:47,929
Do you think so?

1162
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,848
Do you think that we should
shut the lab down?

1163
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,476
-Well…
-It's too soon to decide.

1164
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,979
Judging R&D solely by numbers and output

1165
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,524
is a basic mistake
in adopting performance indicators.

1166
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:00,900
Basic?

1167
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,446
Sure, in the long term.

1168
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,699
But as you know,
Wonhan isn't a charity organization.

1169
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,743
It's just potatoes.

1170
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,246
I don't think we need to wait too long.

1171
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,414
The reason why we bought Sunnyeo Food

1172
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:18,501
is because it's number one
in the potato chip market, correct?

1173
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,503
Potato chips are made of potatoes,

1174
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,130
meaning potatoes are raw materials
for the core product.

1175
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:26,175
So calling them "just potatoes"
doesn't seem right to me.

1176
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,301
Mr. So.

1177
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:30,304
-What I meant…
-That's enough.

1178
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,432
No one wins an argument
against So Baek-ho.

1179
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,604
When we were selecting
scholarship holders,

1180
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:42,233
this young man talked back to me.
And I'm the chairman.

1181
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,278
Not even you can beat him.

1182
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,031
But I do see Ki-se's point.

1183
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:52,577
You're only the temporary chief
while we restructure this place.

1184
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,789
You don't need to work so hard
for every passing position.

1185
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,208
Do you have any plans?

1186
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,883
Yes.

1187
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,844
I have a rough idea for a downsizing.

1188
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,053
Then that's that.

1189
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,764
Take care of it and hurry back to Seoul.

1190
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:16,017
Without you,
the Strategic Planning Department

1191
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,643
doesn't work as well.

1192
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,630
Hello.

1193
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,397
What's this about?

1194
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,191
Take a seat.

1195
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,278
How long is this going to take now?

1196
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,948
Excuse me, Mr. So.

1197
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:16,243
Didn't we agree to keep
work and private life separate?

1198
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:19,413
If you're going to beg me
to date you again,

1199
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,583
I'd appreciate it
if you'd at least do it after work.

1200
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,714
If this isn't about work, I'm leaving.

1201
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,007
I'll just get right to it.

1202
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,515
Ms. Kim.

1203
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,101
You're fired.

1204
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:11,132
THE POTATO LAB

1205
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:48,919
My goal

1206
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,673
is to develop a potato variety
and name it after me.

1207
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,133
My sister…

1208
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,968
she won't answer her phone.

1209
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,845
I wonder if something happened at work.

1210
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,305
Look here!

1211
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,140
Ms. Kim!

1212
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,435
You got fired by Director So, right?

1213
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,146
That's right.
This is the Kim Mi-kyung smile.

1214
01:16:07,702 --> 01:16:09,815
You thought of someone, didn't you?
What was that smile?

1215
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,943
You go out of your way to do
hard work that goes unnoticed.

1216
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:16,822
I don't know why you keep making
bad decisions that hurt you.

1217
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,741
That's why I find you…

1218
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,618
interesting.

1219
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,540
