00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,458
FANTASY OF THE GIRLS

2
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,583
Romeo!

3
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,000
Romeo!

4
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:05,917
Perhaps there's
still some poison on them,

5
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:10,500
to make me die with a medicinal kiss.

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,125
I will kiss your lips!

7
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,083
Stop!

8
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,458
Be serious please!

9
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,375
Memorizing the script is not enough.

10
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,750
What do you mean?

11
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,458
It's absolutely not enough.

12
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,333
I don't want to embarrass myself
in front of Hanam.

13
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,917
She is a woman.

14
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,250
No! She is...

15
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,250
just Hanam.

16
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,750
Romeo is not a woman.
Just in case you don't know.

17
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,833
It doesn't matter!

18
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,917
Okay. You have to buy fried chips too.

19
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,375
Now put your hands on your chest
and try again.

20
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,583
Don't laugh.

21
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,917
Okay. Just don't touch me.

22
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,000
To make me die with a medicinal kiss.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,083
I will kiss your...

24
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,292
What time is it now?

25
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,792
It's twelve.

26
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,667
Is the clock ticking?

27
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,875
The brightness of her cheeks

28
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,958
would outshine the stars

29
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:38,708
the way the sun outshines a lamp.

30
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,125
Why do you have to be Romeo?

31
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,083
Forget about your father
and change your name.

32
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,083
Romeo! Oh my god!

33
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,208
Jesus Christ!

34
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,833
Slow down!

35
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,083
Stop.

36
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:28,500
Hanam's lips are warm...

37
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,042
Senior Hanam!

38
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:42,208
Perhaps there's
still some poison on them,

39
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,417
Peter Piper... picked.. A peck...

40
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:54,833
Your lips are warm!

41
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,417
Thank you.

42
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,417
You have a next chance, you know.

43
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,250
It's over.

44
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,417
Are you crying?

45
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:56,083
Hanam's graduating this year.

46
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,458
She might not be Romeo.

47
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,208
We don't know it yet.

48
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:06,833
Last year our school won
the youth theater festival

49
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,500
and Hanam received
the best performance award.

50
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:14,042
I've crossed my fingers for this day.

51
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,417
You don't understand!

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,083
Of course I don't.

53
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,250
Blame the clock, not me.

54
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:30,458
Okay, deal. Forget the fried chips.

55
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,083
Why are you still so beautiful?

56
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,333
Should I believe that death
keeps you here to be his mistress?

57
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:03,750
I don't like that idea,
so I'll stay with you.

58
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,542
Eyes, look out for the last time!

59
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:12,583
Arms, make your last embrace!

60
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,625
And lips,

61
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,417
seal with a righteous kiss

62
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:19,083
the deal I have made with death forever.

63
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,875
Here's to my love!

64
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:31,833
So I die with a kiss.

65
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,917
There!

66
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,125
What is your name?

67
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,250
It's Sunwha.

68
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,625
Bong Sunwha.

69
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,833
What grade are you in?

70
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:59,083
First grade. Class seven.

71
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,917
Hey!

72
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,542
Follower her!

73
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:37,958
Hot!

74
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,375
Are you satisfied now?

75
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,625
Help yourself. Be happy.

76
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,458
Grab a bite!

77
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,458
One more dish, okay?

78
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,250
Stuffed.

79
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,042
Is this the real end?

80
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:21,750
You have to start first
before you end something.

81
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,417
Poor you.

82
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,083
You have no feelings.

83
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:28,500
Forget about her.

84
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,458
By the way, I was impressed...

85
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,292
by your terrible acting!

86
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,083
Hey!

87
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,833
Stop teasing me!

88
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,000
Bye.

89
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,917
Watch your head.

90
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,250
See ya!　-See ya!

91
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,417
Supper's ready!

92
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,917
Zero.

93
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,250
Zero.

94
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,500
Zero.

95
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:50,917
Zero.

96
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,333
One thousand five hundred Won.

97
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,083
I went to school today!

98
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,167
Why don't you walk
when there's no class?

99
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,792
It's good for your health too.

100
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,125
Save your money.
No one walks in your shoes.

101
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,167
Besides, can't you see your parents
are working hard for your education?

102
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:16,333
You always say that
and we're always poor.

103
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,542
She has a point.

104
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,875
Sis, am I getting one more niece?

105
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,792
Yes!

106
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:50,333
I'd be so happy to give you a job
as a babysitter!

107
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,500
You have to pay first.

108
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,292
Eat more.

109
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm done.

110
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,000
Be quiet.

111
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,167
Sis!

112
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,125
What?

113
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,208
How do you keep going to school?

114
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,083
Shut up!

115
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:29,917
Hey~

116
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,125
Good morning, mother-in-law.

117
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:41,833
Good morning.

118
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,583
Good morning, father-in-law.

119
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,250
How many times do I have to tell you?

120
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,250
Stop calling them in-laws.

121
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,208
Have you had breakfast, my son-in-law?

122
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,208
Mum!

123
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,500
Yes I have!

124
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,458
Aren't you going to school?

125
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,875
After breakfast.

126
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,708
Aren't you late?

127
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:46,417
I'll walk with her.

128
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,958
Her school is exactly
at the opposite direction from yours.

129
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,375
I guess so...

130
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,417
You're late.

131
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,833
Have a nice day.

132
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,625
Don't show up at my school again!

133
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,208
Is that her, the stalker?

134
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,333
I heard she was in the third grade.

135
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,167
What a bitch!

136
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,125
What is she doing now?

137
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,542
Studying.

138
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,833
What for?

139
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:21,417
Key word here is "our world view..."

140
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,125
It starts with superlative.

141
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:28,875
"The most striking thing," this means...

142
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:33,875
This part is very important.

143
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:38,750
It cannot be stressed more!

144
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,083
Lunch time!

145
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,958
Starving...

146
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,792
Senior, Have a good day!

147
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,083
Look!

148
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,042
Hanam is drinking what I gave her!

149
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,167
Your sis was on TV again.

150
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,750
Frankly speaking,

151
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,083
she shouldn't have done that.

152
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,875
She went overboard. Stalking is bad.

153
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,083
She's got a nickname now.

154
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,000
What nickname?

155
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,542
Astro stalker.

156
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,750
Atalker in short!

157
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:08,875
Man's hand is so different from woman's.

158
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,125
Manhood starts from the hand.

159
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,958
Look at those tendons.

160
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,875
They look so different.

161
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,250
The harmony between man and woman
is the law of nature.

162
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,750
How about the other way round?

163
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,500
The other way round?

164
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,000
How about Jieun's heart for Hanam?

165
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:28,917
Well...

166
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,083
That's the law of universe!

167
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,083
(Juliet "Bong Sunwha")

168
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,750
What are you looking at?

169
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,792
Well...

170
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:18,250
Follow me.

171
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,583
Senior Suyeon...

172
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,750
I'm not playing Juliet!

173
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:28,417
First, I'm a member of a photo club.

174
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,750
Second, I have no experience in acting.

175
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,625
Third, I don't like to be on stage.

176
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,458
These are the reasons.

177
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,375
I see.

178
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,250
You can go now.

179
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,083
I'll find another person.

180
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,958
Have a good day.

181
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,333
First,

182
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,875
you don't have to quit the photo club.

183
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,542
Second,

184
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,708
you have a good voice.

185
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,500
It will be perfect with practice.

186
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,417
Third,

187
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:18,125
you have prepared what you wanted to say.

188
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,500
You know what to do to be on stage.

189
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:25,083
Sorry, I think I made myself clear.

190
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,750
Fourth,

191
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,458
I like you.

192
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:38,125
I wish you would respect
director's decision.

193
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,333
Do it!
I can't.

194
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,583
Do it!

195
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,667
I can't.

196
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:02,625
Do it!

197
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,708
I can't!

198
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:09,333
Sunwha.

199
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,750
I'm asking you.

200
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:16,750
It would be so terrible to see
Hanam with someone else.

201
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,292
What do you like so much about her?

202
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,125
She is amazing.

203
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,625
And narcissistic.

204
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,167
She's not!

205
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,875
You haven't seen
what's hidden inside of her yet.

206
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,917
I bet you haven't either.

207
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,167
I have.

208
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,250
If you like someone,
you can see everything.

209
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,417
What nonsense!

210
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:40,750
It's not.

211
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,083
You're just too young to know it yet.

212
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,208
Bye!

213
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,000
Be careful at crossroads.
OK

214
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:08,125
It seems you are born to be here.

215
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,250
Does it happen at your school too?

216
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:15,917
Happen what?

217
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,500
Does anyone have a crush
on a senior student?

218
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,625
Are you nuts?

219
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,417
That's disgusting.

220
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,083
We usually avoid seniors.

221
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:43,125
Like the wind that blows away.

222
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,000
Like the moonlight that drifts away.

223
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:52,625
Love never stays I wish I only knew.

224
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,458
Acting?

225
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,250
Do you really think you can play Juliet?

226
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,042
Love crushed your heart to see the blood.

227
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:10,625
Love is complex to make me puzzled.

228
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:15,125
If I only knew I wouldn't have prayed.

229
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:17,458
You'd better not.

230
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,167
I don't wanna be bullied
at school like you.

231
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,042
I'll graduate in a few months anyway.

232
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,792
I'm just worried about you.

233
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,792
Oh love, you made me blind.

234
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:37,292
Please tell me from where you come

235
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,333
and to where you go.

236
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,792
That's the girl you wanted for Juliet?

237
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,917
Don't miss the practice.

238
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:44,958
Hey.

239
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,042
Hold it.

240
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,250
Okay.

241
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,625
Anything wrong?

242
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,250
Your hands are baby soft.

243
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,208
That hurts!

244
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:16,625
It's natural.

245
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,750
Bend down slowly.

246
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:41,583
I don't want to hear any complaints
about the roles you're given.

247
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,583
Understand?

248
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,667
Yes!

249
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:50,583
Memorize every dialogue,
direction and even mark.

250
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,417
If any of you make a mistake,

251
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,917
you will run the playground
as a punishment.

252
00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:01,083
Especially you be careful!

253
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,083
That's it for today.

254
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,958
Thank you!

255
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:10,875
Sunwha!

256
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,625
Is everything alright?

257
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm not sure yet...

258
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,542
You'll be fine.

259
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:23,458
You should be fine.

260
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,875
You're Juliet.

261
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:54,500
Sunwha!

262
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,000
Get off.

263
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:25,917
My friend likes you very much...

264
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,458
She wants to get close to you.

265
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,125
Bring her when we practice.

266
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:36,750
Yes.

267
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,500
You seem to be a friendly person.

268
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,458
Do I?

269
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:52,958
To the universe!

270
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:08,542
When it gets suddenly quiet,
say "to the universe!"

271
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:12,000
and you'll transport
to the 4th dimension.

272
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,792
See you tomorrow.

273
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:17,708
Yes.

274
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,958
I like people saying
"see you tomorrow."

275
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,125
Me too.

276
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,917
See you tomorrow.

277
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,417
See you tomorrow.

278
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,375
Mum, I have something to ask you.

279
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,583
Yes?

280
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,250
You're a woman, aren't you?

281
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,708
Then why does your body
look so different?

282
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,333
I delivered two babies, including you.

283
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:21,750
Even so, It looks still weird.

284
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,708
Stop talking gibberish and take a shower.

285
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,583
You smell bad, honey.

286
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,958
Suyeon,

287
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,583
can you help me solve this question?

288
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,250
Wait a minute.

289
00:30:58,708 --> 00:30:59,583
Sunwha!

290
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,167
Do you need help with the script?

291
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,208
Well...

292
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,083
Actually I made some changes for you.

293
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,625
Well...

294
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,750
This is my older sister.

295
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,042
Atalker?

296
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,875
Have a good day.

297
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,250
See you!

298
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,917
I'm home!

299
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,125
Good afternoon.

300
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:55,958
Good afternoon.

301
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:59,833
We're going to study together.

302
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:00,958
Will you go to Woochul's house?

303
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:01,958
It's okay...

304
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,583
She really bothers people.

305
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,083
She won't leave us alone.

306
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,250
Hurry.

307
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,792
Sorry.

308
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,083
It's okay.

309
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,917
Sunwha.

310
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,417
Take this.

311
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,250
I'm really fine.

312
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:28,875
Call me sis.

313
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,917
Like a real sister.

314
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,958
Yes...

315
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,000
Let's go in.

316
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,375
Have a nice day.

317
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,292
Rainbow appears in the dark

318
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:36,875
when all the living things
on earth are happy.

319
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,083
If rainbow appears tonight,

320
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:46,417
it means the person who made me sad

321
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,708
is happy without me.

322
00:33:56,583 --> 00:34:01,208
The waterfall drops over the lofty cliff
with no sign of fear.

323
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,167
The uncontrollable spate drops

324
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,000
with no sense of
falling toward anything,

325
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,833
making no distinction
between night and day,

326
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,375
like a noble mind,

327
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,792
never pausing for rest.

328
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:19,458
When nightfall comes,

329
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:24,083
ox-eye and houses hid from sight,

330
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:28,625
the waterfall drops
with upright sound.

331
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,417
It's not too late yet.

332
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,458
Go back if you want to.

333
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:54,708
The sky is so blue today.

334
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:02,083
Sometimes, blue sky gets hurt too.

335
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,500
Come with me.

336
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:51,750
Are you looking for something?

337
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,583
A new heart.

338
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,917
Why does everything change?

339
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,917
I'll find something that never changes.

340
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,125
Like mummies?

341
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,875
Wait!

342
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:36,917
Why?

343
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,542
You come home late everyday these days.

344
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,208
None of your business.

345
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:45,500
Don't you ever wonder anything about me?

346
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,375
No.

347
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,542
Think again.

348
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,750
Absolutely no.

349
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,083
You came to my school again?

350
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,750
Oh Romeo!

351
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:12,583
Let's try again.

352
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,167
Oh Romeo!

353
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,125
No no... again.

354
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,125
Oh Romeo!

355
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,583
Oh Juliet!

356
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,708
I flew over these walls

357
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,375
with the light wings of love.

358
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,125
Stone walls can't keep love out.

359
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,250
Whatever a man in love...

360
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,083
his love will make

361
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,625
him try to do it.

362
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,542
Therefore your relatives
are no obstacle.

363
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,917
If they see you, they'll murder you.

364
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:57,167
Alas!

365
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,625
One angry look from you...

366
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:05,917
would be worse than

367
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,292
your relatives with swords.

368
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,917
My relatives with swords ...

369
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,583
hate you...

370
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,708
That's actually what
I've been wondering about.

371
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,000
Do you hate me too?

372
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,917
Of course.

373
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,250
We don't have time for this!

374
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,958
I have to memorize all these
in three weeks!

375
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:38,417
Do you really think you're smart
enough to memorize in such a short time?

376
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,875
Whatever!

377
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:43,000
Don't worry.

378
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:47,583
When you act,
I'll sit at the very front row

379
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,208
and watch you all
through the performance.

380
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,333
Don't even think about it!

381
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,917
Hanam looks...

382
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,417
Have you talked to her?

383
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,000
She looks like a nice person.

384
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,250
Of course she is.

385
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,375
Now you know!

386
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:17,917
But behind her smile,

387
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:22,250
I see sadness and solitude.

388
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,208
That's part of her charm.

389
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:28,375
She is so cool.

390
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,292
She makes me feel sad.

391
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,583
This is my friend

392
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,958
I mentioned before.

393
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,917
You give this to me every day.

394
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,292
Do you remember?

395
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:15,250
How did you know I like this?

396
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,792
I watched you and...

397
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,792
thought about you every day.

398
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,125
Hello.

399
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,167
Good afternoon.

400
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,417
I was about to call you.

401
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,000
Will you open your arms?

402
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:07,875
Other members have their costumes
from last year.

403
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,542
But since you're new,

404
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,875
we have to make a new one.

405
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,292
Good afternoon, senior!

406
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,417
We'll begin in five minutes.

407
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,250
Yes senior!

408
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,500
Go get ready.

409
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,167
Yes.

410
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,208
Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?

411
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,583
Have you spoken to him?

412
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:44,458
Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?

413
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,417
I am tired.

414
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:50,375
Oh my, my bones ache so much.

415
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,917
I've been running all over the place.

416
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:07,208
There! What are you doing?

417
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,000
Why aren't you practicing?

418
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,792
Senior Hanam hasn't come yet.

419
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,000
Good afternoon!

420
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,708
Good afternoon!

421
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,500
Since when have you been there?

422
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,375
Why would you care?

423
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:44,708
Your hand is like a holy place
that my hand is unworthy to visit.

424
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:48,833
My lips are ready to make things
better with a kiss.

425
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,792
Weather is hot.

426
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:19,042
Life is boring.

427
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,708
How far worse can my life be?

428
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,542
My life isn't boring.

429
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:26,833
Mine either,
except for the religion class.

430
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,917
Girls, give me a break.

431
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:33,417
Find your love.

432
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,958
And the world will be beautiful.

433
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,458
What is love?

434
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:40,042
Show me.

435
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:41,583
How can I show it to you?

436
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:45,208
How do you know it's love
when you can't even see it?

437
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,625
Close your eyes.

438
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,750
Stop it!

439
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,375
Close your eyes.

440
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:58,667
Imagine you're sitting
before an emerald shining sea.

441
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:01,958
Waves splash.

442
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,583
Beautiful beach.

443
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:07,542
You're happy and calm.

444
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,125
Turn your head.

445
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,375
You'll see a face smiling.

446
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,083
Whose face is it?

447
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,583
Atalker!

448
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:27,167
You okay?

449
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,375
Yeah.

450
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,292
Bright day.

451
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:39,250
b-r-i-l-l-i-a-n-t

452
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,375
brilliant.

453
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:42,708
Spell "cruel."

454
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,208
c-r-u-e-l

455
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,042
How about "affection?"

456
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,333
To the universe!

457
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,542
What a dork!　-You freaked me out!

458
00:48:58,292 --> 00:48:59,667
Imagine a cheetah and a shark
are having a race.

459
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:00,958
Which one do you think would win?

460
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:03,125
Neither of them.

461
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,750
Cheetahs will drown in the sea
and sharks can't breathe on the ground.

462
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,000
Isn't it funny?

463
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:26,125
I'm turning into a monster.

464
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,750
I feel like there's an alien inside me

465
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:36,542
waiting to tear my body apart
and get out.

466
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,708
What the heck are you talking about?

467
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,208
I just broke your record!

468
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,583
Do you wanna challenge again?

469
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:48,333
Come on.

470
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,792
Thank you my good Lord,

471
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,375
Have mercy on these students

472
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:14,375
and help all of them enter a college...

473
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,458
Father.

474
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:19,292
I'm sick.

475
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:29,125
Your throat looks okay.

476
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,250
Let me check on the body temperature.

477
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:36,667
How much time do I have left?

478
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,500
If you keep teasing me,

479
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,375
I'll send you to a psychiatrist.

480
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,667
People don't die that easily.

481
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:55,750
Do I have the flu?

482
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,250
No, you don't.

483
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,542
Just a little fever. So...

484
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,792
Stop faking being ill!

485
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,583
I have a headache

486
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:10,750
and I hear something too.

487
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,917
Something that interrupts
when you study?

488
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:18,333
Yes, like the sound of rustling leaves.

489
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:23,792
Like the sound of the footsteps
walking in zero gravity.

490
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:25,042
Zero gravity?

491
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:30,750
I really want to take a look
inside your brain now.

492
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:40,000
Your feet are on the ground...

493
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:45,167
Don't go any further.

494
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:48,292
You're really scaring me now.

495
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,542
Where are you going? Class has begun!

496
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,625
Your SAT is in a few days.

497
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,583
Yes, sir.

498
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:14,042
Focus, students!

499
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,125
There's nothing more foolish
than to regret

500
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:17,167
after you ruin your life.

501
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:17,875
Understand?

502
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,583
Yes, sir.

503
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:22,375
Just a few more days to go.

504
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:23,333
Let's focus. Okay?

505
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,500
Yes!

506
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:33,708
So, this is why scientists
are supporting this theory.

507
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:34,417
Understand?
Yes!

508
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:41,542
To recap, the Big Bang Theory is...

509
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,375
Hanam, can you help me practice acting?

510
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:37,125
I can't do a personal favor.
That's too selfish.

511
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,000
It's for everyone.

512
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,833
I'm the only one who's not good.

513
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:46,083
Under one condition, then.

514
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:48,417
Yes?

515
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:56,083
Promise you won't love me.

516
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:00,958
Is everything alright?

517
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:03,458
It's not like you to come to see me.

518
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:07,417
Are you ready to take my heart at last?

519
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,542
Crap!

520
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:12,667
By the way,

521
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:14,958
do these pictures turn you on?

522
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:15,583
Yes.

523
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:17,375
No!

524
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,208
Those are my friend's.

525
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,792
He downloaded them

526
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,375
and forgot to take them with him.

527
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,083
Yeah, whatever.

528
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:33,000
Who's sexier?

529
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:35,708
I haven't seen you naked, so...

530
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,292
Pervert!

531
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,833
I just answered to your question.

532
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:56,875
Woochul.
Yeah?

533
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:02,042
What do you think love is?

534
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,750
A good thing?

535
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:09,125
Freak.

536
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,000
What do you mean?

537
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,667
I'm not thinking what you're thinking.

538
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,292
How about you?

539
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,833
Something you shouldn't do.

540
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:09,500
What are you doing there?

541
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:11,333
Stand up.

542
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,917
It's easier to phonate
when you're up straight.

543
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:16,792
Try now.

544
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,750
I wish night would come,

545
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:24,292
like a widow dressed in black,

546
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:27,625
so I can learn
how to submit to my husband

547
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,875
and lose my virginity.

548
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,500
Imagine a space far ahead.

549
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,875
Now, try again.

550
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,875
I wish night would come,

551
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:39,875
like a widow dressed in black,

552
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:42,667
Imagine a space far ahead.

553
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:44,167
Try again.

554
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,208
I wish night would come,

555
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,667
Put your hand on the chest.

556
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:53,667
Let the blood rushing

557
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:56,042
to my cheeks be calmed.

558
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:58,333
- I wish night would come,
- Unfold your arm.

559
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,083
I wish night would come,

560
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:03,500
Hold your back upright.
Show your emotion.

561
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,708
Try again.

562
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:09,333
Isn't Hanam coming today?

563
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,917
Is it important to you?

564
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:23,625
This is Juliet's monologue.
You don't need Romeo.

565
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,042
I know...

566
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,875
By the way,

567
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:38,583
Why do people today speak differently
from Romeo and Juliet

568
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:47,000
even though the feelings of love
are not different?

569
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,792
Because romance and poems

570
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:01,083
don't exist anymore, I guess.

571
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:25,250
Stop!

572
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:58,875
Down.

573
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,042
1、2、3

574
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:13,083
1、2...

575
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,625
Are you ready?

576
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,042
Lie down.

577
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:00,875
Lie down?

578
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:01,958
Yes.

579
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:40,042
Mother~

580
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:29,292
May the heavens be happy

581
01:06:29,292 --> 01:06:32,792
with this holy act of marriage,

582
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:36,250
so nothing unfortunate happens

583
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,792
later to make us regret it.

584
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:44,625
Father, But whatever misfortunes occur,

585
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,750
they can't ruin the joy

586
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,667
I feel with one look at her.

587
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,333
These sudden joys have sudden endings.

588
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,500
Too much honey is delicious,

589
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,167
but it makes you sick to your stomach.

590
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,500
Therefore, love each other
in moderation.

591
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,750
Too fast is as bad as too slow.

592
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,292
Romeo!

593
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,208
Here comes the lady.

594
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:10,292
Juliet!

595
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,292
Lovers are so light

596
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,833
they can walk on a spider web
floating on a summer breeze,

597
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,458
and yet not fall.

598
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,500
Juliet!

599
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,375
If you're as happy as I am,
and you're better with words,

600
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:26,042
tell me about the happiness.

601
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:29,667
Romeo, my true love has made me so rich

602
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:30,958
that I can't count
even half of my wealth.

603
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,083
No, that's not it.

604
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,792
Do it again.

605
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:39,208
Romeo, my true love has made me so rich

606
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,458
that I can't count
even half of my wealth.

607
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:41,542
From the beginning.

608
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,958
She isn't wrong. Let's move on.

609
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,583
Continue.

610
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:54,083
Do it.

611
01:07:56,792 --> 01:07:59,500
Romeo, my true love has made me so rich

612
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,875
that I can't count
even half of my wealth.

613
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:01,958
Again.

614
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:05,292
Romeo, my true love has made me so rich

615
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:06,667
that I can't count
even half of my wealth.

616
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:07,625
Again.

617
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:11,292
Romeo, my true love has made me so rich

618
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:12,583
that I can't count
even half of my wealth.

619
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,958
Again!

620
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:20,000
Romeo...

621
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,333
Juliet!

622
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:22,958
Please hold my hand.

623
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:26,833
The night is full of joy
and with you beside me

624
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:30,417
I'll sing a love song even in the dark.

625
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,792
Everything that is mine exists for you!

626
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,625
Everything that belongs
to this world exists for you!

627
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:39,375
Stop.

628
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:32,667
What?

629
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:55,500
I'm...

630
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,875
so sick of you.

631
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,250
Senior Hanam!

632
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:40,583
Senior Hanam!

633
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:43,417
Are you okay?

634
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,542
Yes.

635
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,458
Did I do anything wrong?

636
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,167
No.

637
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,000
Then what is it?

638
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,125
It's not your business.

639
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:39,958
What you are feeling now is not right.

640
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,542
Hey girls!

641
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:21,083
You have a flower on your head!

642
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,917
How does it look on me?

643
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,458
Weather's beautiful!

644
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:31,125
I wanna dive into the sky!

645
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,667
To the universe!

646
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,292
Waves!

647
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:01,208
Splash as if today is your last day!

648
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:54,542
I love the sea...

649
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,417
Do you know what traffic light love is?

650
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:07,917
It's the love that doesn't allow you
to be with your lover

651
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:09,750
just like the traffic lights.

652
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:14,250
When the green light is on,
the red light goes off.

653
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:17,708
When the red light is on,
the green light goes off.

654
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,250
Like Romeo and Juliet?

655
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:29,958
Love is as selfish as human beings are.

656
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:36,792
Oh, Romeo!

657
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:39,958
Why do you have to be Romeo?

658
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:44,625
Forget about your father
and change your name.

659
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:48,667
If you won't change your name,

660
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:53,417
just swear you love me.

661
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,792
The thing we call a rose would smell
just as sweet

662
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:10,458
if we called it by any other name.

663
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:17,333
Romeo would be just as perfect

664
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,833
even if he wasn't called Romeo.

665
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:27,000
Romeo, lose your name

666
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:34,500
which really has nothing to do with you

667
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,208
and take all of me in exchange.

668
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:48,042
I trust your words.

669
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:55,625
Just call me your love,
and I will take a new name.

670
01:17:58,042 --> 01:18:01,250
From now on I will never be Romeo again.

671
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:14,333
This looks really bad.

672
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:17,708
It's better to buy a new one.

673
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,375
Senior Suyeon.

674
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:00,625
We are friends.

675
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:03,792
Are you afraid of
how others would see us?

676
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:08,375
We have changed.

677
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:10,875
Both of us.

678
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:16,833
Suyeon.

679
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:20,917
Stop it.

680
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:49,625
(Romeo and Juliet)

681
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:11,083
I checked my attendance and found

682
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:13,833
I'm done with my class hours
required to graduate.

683
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,667
What are you talking about?

684
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:21,542
I'm leaving for New York
after the performance.

685
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:25,625
Do you wanna come with me?

686
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:39,750
The hairpin Sunwha's wearing.

687
01:24:42,417 --> 01:24:43,917
Did you give it to her?

688
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:22,417
Where is the dress?

689
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,208
It is in the closet.

690
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:26,750
Are you ready?

691
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:27,833
Yes!

692
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:32,000
A tragic love story
of two young people!

693
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:36,000
Two children become lovers
and commit suicide!

694
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:41,958
Their unfortunate deaths

695
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:51,042
put an end to their parents' feud!

696
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:02,833
What a great music!

697
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:05,500
Enjoy freedom while you are young.

698
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:10,708
Forget about Rosaline,
it's no use tonight.

699
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,917
No, noble Romeo, you've got to dance.

700
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:19,792
Not me, believe me.

701
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:24,125
You're wearing dancing shoes
with nimble soles.

702
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:26,500
My soul is made out of lead.

703
01:26:27,417 --> 01:26:29,583
How foolish!

704
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:31,625
Hey Romeo!

705
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:36,542
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher
than the average man.

706
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:39,042
Enough, Mercutio, be quiet.

707
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:41,125
You're talking nonsense.

708
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:44,500
True. I'm talking about dreams.

709
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,458
Dinner is over,
and we're going to get there too late.

710
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:51,417
I'm worried we'll get there too early.

711
01:26:51,417 --> 01:26:55,583
I have a feeling this party tonight

712
01:26:55,583 --> 01:27:00,667
will be the start of something new.

713
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:22,542
She shows the torches
how to burn bright!

714
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:25,792
She outshines the other women
like a white dove.

715
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:28,917
When this dance is over,
I'll touch her hand with my one.

716
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:34,625
I never saw true beauty before tonight.

717
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:35,042
Your hand is like a holy place
that my hand is unworthy to visit.

718
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:38,208
My lips are ready to make things
better with a kiss.

719
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:44,792
You don't give your hand enough credit.

720
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:53,458
Holding one palm against another
is like a kiss.

721
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:55,833
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too?

722
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:58,333
Everything that is mine exists for you!

723
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:01,208
Everything that belongs
to this world exists for you!

724
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:16,542
Let lips do what hands do.

725
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:21,417
Please grant my prayer

726
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:25,167
so my faith doesn't turn to despair.

727
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:01,792
My first love...

728
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:09,750
My first love...

729
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:18,833
My first love...

730
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,000
is Romeo.

731
01:32:16,083 --> 01:32:17,958
Come on!

732
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,125
Stab him!

733
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,917
Stop it!

734
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:34,625
Zero.

735
01:33:35,792 --> 01:33:36,875
Zero.

736
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,292
Zero.

737
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:42,000
Zero.

738
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:45,167
Hundred thousand Won!

739
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,875
That is a lot of money...

740
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:55,292
Mum, love is round.

741
01:33:55,917 --> 01:33:56,792
What?

742
01:33:58,208 --> 01:34:06,208
It is round to hold everything inside,

743
01:34:09,083 --> 01:34:10,417
like the universe.

744
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:13,875
What are you talking about?

745
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,500
You sound weird these days.

746
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:22,333
Let's eat

747
01:34:23,667 --> 01:34:26,125
before she turns into an astronaut.

748
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:30,375
Sis,

749
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,792
I'm sorry.

750
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,792
I'll be a good sister from now on.

751
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:32,208
Why did you do that?

752
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:35,500
If you like someone,

753
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:41,167
you can see everything.

754
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:50,083
To the universe!　-To the universe!

755
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:12,500
Take one at a day.

756
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:15,292
By the time you have them all,

757
01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:17,833
you'll forget everything.

758
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:28,208
Hanam, I like people saying

759
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:31,583
"see you tomorrow."

760
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:35,708
See you tomorrow.

761
01:37:56,125 --> 01:38:03,708
Good night, good night!

762
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:09,375
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

763
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:41,208
You are late.

764
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:42,167
Sorry.

765
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:14,458
To be or not to be: that is the question.

766
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:20,417
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer.

767
01:41:20,417 --> 01:41:22,625
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.

768
01:41:24,417 --> 01:41:28,583
Or to take arms against
a sea of troubles,

769
01:41:30,958 --> 01:41:32,625
And by opposing end them.

770
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,667
Beware of jealousy, my lord!

771
01:41:37,375 --> 01:41:41,333
It's a green-eyed monster that
makes fun of the victims it devours.

772
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:46,458
Think of the unhappiness
of a man who worships his wife,

773
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:49,083
yet doubts her faithfulness.

774
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:53,375
He suspects her, but still loves her.

775
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,417
Are you depressed again?

776
01:41:57,375 --> 01:42:02,583
You can't choose your time
of death any more

777
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:05,583
than your time of birth.

778
01:42:05,583 --> 01:42:11,042
We live and die when our time comes.

779
01:42:22,042 --> 01:42:23,708
If you can't fix it,

780
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:26,333
you shouldn't give it a second thought.

781
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:31,875
What's done is done.

782
01:42:33,083 --> 01:42:34,917
I need to calm down,

783
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:37,625
make my love and my joy less intense.

784
01:42:38,958 --> 01:42:40,625
Please make my love less,

785
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:42,417
or I'm going to overindulge.

786
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:45,958
For shame!

787
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,333
What kind of loyalty is this?

788
01:42:49,958 --> 01:42:51,958
The more fool you
for betting on my loyalty.

789
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:58,458
In time I may come to believe you,
but I'm wary.

790
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:02,917
When we're in love,
we don't see with our eyes

791
01:43:02,917 --> 01:43:04,667
but with our minds.

792
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:08,833
That's why paintings of Cupid,
the god of love,

793
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:10,792
always show him as blind.

794
01:43:11,542 --> 01:43:14,958
The whole world is a stage,

795
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:18,375
and all the men and women merely actors.

796
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:21,417
They have their exits
and their entrances,

797
01:43:21,417 --> 01:43:24,292
and in his lifetime
a man will play many parts.

798
01:43:24,625 --> 01:43:28,125
However much we like to brag,

799
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:33,042
the truth is that we men change our minds
a lot more than women do,

800
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:41,375
and our desires come and go
a lot faster than theirs.

801
01:43:42,958 --> 01:43:44,750
I swear, dear sister,

802
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:48,625
I have not yet encountered
that special face

803
01:43:48,625 --> 01:43:51,750
I might prefer to any other.

804
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:55,958
If you want him, dear sister,
he's yours.

805
01:43:55,958 --> 01:44:03,667
I swear I'll woo him for you myself.

806
01:44:03,667 --> 01:44:05,958
Oh, Romeo!

807
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:10,792
Why do you have to be Romeo?

808
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:15,708
Forget about your father
and change your name.

809
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:25,167
If you won't change your name,
just swear you love me.
