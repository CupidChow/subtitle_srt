1
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:24,042
Oops, take a shower first…

2
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,652
[laughs]

3
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,086
Shower…

4
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:35,668
Pat! Hey!

5
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:25,723
[knocking on door]

6
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,158
Can I join you?

7
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,536
So what if my grades in Strategic Marketing
went down by two points?

8
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,162
It's no big deal.

9
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,511
It's a big deal, Erin.

10
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:36,657
Marketing Management is your major.

11
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,879
Aside from that,

12
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:42,919
your grades also went down
in two other subjects.

13
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,876
Advertising Research,

14
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,384
and Social Marketing...

15
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,539
What's the matter?

16
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,571
This has never happened before.

17
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:53,105
Exactly.

18
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:54,873
This is the first time it happened.

19
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,700
Last semester, I was
at the top of my class.

20
00:08:58,762 --> 00:08:59,882
And you know what,

21
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,025
I can do that again if I want to.

22
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,638
So why are you so worried?

23
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,259
More concerning for me

24
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:11,926
is why you can't maintain
your high grades.

25
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:15,816
Is there something bothering you?

26
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,471
Any problems at home?

27
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:25,384
[Erin] Why can't she just mind
her own business

28
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:28,092
and stop meddling in
my social life?

29
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,771
Hello?

30
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,535
That's why she's a
Guidance Counselor.

31
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,667
To guide and to counsel.

32
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:39,440
Get it?

33
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:42,518
And you like her so much.

34
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,985
You know that I don't have
a mom anymore.

35
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:50,267
So I really appreciate it that
Ms. Bea is like a mom to me.

36
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:56,365
Erin, isn't that the bartender
who's been staring at you?

37
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:00,166
So he's a student here?

38
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,253
Hey, he's good!

39
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:06,606
Cute, too.

40
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:09,474
Good, yes.

41
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:11,097
Cute, yes.

42
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,847
But he's still just a bartender.

43
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:20,498
Well, he can get me drunk anytime.

44
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:21,524
My God.

45
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,030
Just drink to that, okay.

46
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,919
Good! Because I'm thirsty.

47
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:27,613
I'll eat that later.

48
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,546
I'm on a diet. Cheers!

49
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:33,474
- No, I'm okay.
- You need this. Go on.

50
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,494
- You want this?
- I'm good.

51
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,724
Hi hon, how was your day?

52
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:00,727
Long and tiring.

53
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:05,237
I'll take care of that…

54
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,125
[phone rings]

55
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,066
Emily...

56
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:26,129
have you sent me the file?

57
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,262
Good… I'll check it now. Wait.

58
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:29,996
Okay.

59
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32,656
Are you ready
for the presentation?

60
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,184
[Erin] Letty, hurry up!

61
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:39,974
Daddy will be here any minute.

62
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,215
Dad! Good morning!

63
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:48,889
Let's have breakfast.

64
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,489
Sorry I'm running late.

65
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,657
I cooked your favorite
pancakes and bacon.

66
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:55,242
- Wow, bacon.
- Let me, Dad.

67
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,576
I'm the expert.

68
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:58,887
I have an early meeting.

69
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:00,610
So, I have to go.

70
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:02,432
Coffee? How about coffee?

71
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,639
Hmm...

72
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,119
There's coffee at the office.

73
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,931
Did your dad have breakfast?

74
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,217
Here, let me. Leave us.

75
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,013
Hi, Buddy.

76
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:28,228
[Jave] Erin!

77
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,332
Erin!

78
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:32,640
Sir...

79
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,837
What the hell are you doing
in my pool? Huh?

80
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,047
Get out of there!

81
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:39,259
- Who is this?
- Sir.

82
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:40,504
Who's this guy you let in?

83
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:42,151
Who are you?

84
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,123
- Sir!
- Who's this?

85
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:50,376
Dad...

86
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:04,954
[Bea] I don't know what to
say Dean but...

87
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:06,823
thank you for this opportunity.

88
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:09,334
So, is that a yes?

89
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:10,886
Um...

90
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:13,554
honestly, I'm not sure.

91
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:14,891
Bea,

92
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,628
Director of Student Affairs is the
position you've been aspiring for.

93
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:21,512
You're more than qualified for it.

94
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,405
I know, but...

95
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:28,370
can you give me some time
to think about it?

96
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,064
Sure.

97
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:34,290
Thank you.

98
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,430
Two gin tonic, please.

99
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:45,497
Okay, sir.

100
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:54,388
Dude.

101
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,831
Does that girl in black
have a boyfriend?

102
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,691
The cute one.

103
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:01,484
Why, sir?

104
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,788
She's hot.

105
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:06,276
Pretty. She seems easy to get.

106
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,246
Come on Erin, let's dance.

107
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:14,574
- Later.
- Okay. Let's go.

108
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,162
Right on time.

109
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:40,444
Let's drink?

110
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,174
Oops! Sorry, sir!

111
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,658
- Shit!
- Sorry.

112
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:48,143
Sorry, miss... I'm really sorry.

113
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:49,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

114
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:52,077
What the hell!
Are you messing with me?

115
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,725
Huh? No! It's this idiot's fault!

116
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,554
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean it.
It was too dark. Sorry.

117
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:01,131
Sorry.

118
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,996
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
Let me clean that up.

119
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,983
Erin! Let's go!

120
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,919
- Come here!
- Let's go!

are you okay?

Yes, my knight in shining armor.

Are you okay?

129

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,783
Over here.

137
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,839
Uh...

138
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,578
Alright, ma'am. I'll go ahead.

139
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:54,286
Uh, what's your name again?

140
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:57,322
Vincent Garrido, ma'am.

141
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,289
Are you a friend of Erin's?

142
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,776
No.

143
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,863
We go to the same school, but

144
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:06,958
we don't actually know each other.

145
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:08,979
Oh, I see.

00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:10,710
You two should meet...

when she's sober.

148
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,342
Are you sure you don't
want anything?

149
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:18,479
- Coffee? Water?
- No, ma'am. Thank you.

150
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:19,626
No,

151
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,331
thank you.

152
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:25,785

an endangered species.

Alright then. I'll go ahead.

I missed you!

You didn't show up last Saturday.

172
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:33,326
Sorry, something came up.
An emergency.

173
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,189

174
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:38,799
Well, how about making up for it?

Didn't we just had our playtime?

Now this is Playtime.ph.

185
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:05,930
Try it, maybe you
could also do a ‘scatter'.

186
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:07,589
Scatter?

187
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,948
Yeah, scatter.

188
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:11,599
It's addicting.

189
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:14,450
Come on, go to Playtime.ph.

190
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:16,042
Wait.

191
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,176
There.

192
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,366
Look, I was able to do scatter.

193
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,316
See?

194
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:25,532
Okay, scatter later.

195
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,410
[knocks on door]

196
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,084
Come in.

197
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,460
Oh, Vincent, come in.

198
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:52,520
[door closes]

199
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:55,491
Good morning, ma'am.

200
00:28:56,112 --> 00:28:57,201
Good morning.

201
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:00,332
Don't be scared, have a seat.

202
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,456
Sorry, ma'am. I didn't know
that you're the--

203
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:11,270
Is this your first time
to be called in here?

204
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:12,971
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,373
Oh. That's good.

206
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:18,742
That means you don't have a
problem with your studies.

207
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:23,045
Hmm...

208
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:26,081
You have a clean record.

209
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:30,169
And you're able to maintain
your athletic scholarship.

210
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,754
Congratulations.

211
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,774
Is this about my night job?

212
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:39,494
Night job?

213
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:42,556
At the bar.

214
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:47,619
- In a way, yes--
- Ma'am, if it isn't allowed...

215
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,475
I'll look for a different job.

216
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,837
No, no, no Vincent.

217
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:54,871
I want you to stay there so
that you can watch over Erin.

218
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:57,621
Don't worry,

219
00:29:57,978 --> 00:29:59,713
- I'll pay you for your time.
- Ma'am?

220
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:03,384
I want you to report everything to me-

221
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,890
where she goes,

222
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:09,480
what she does,
what she's drinking.

223
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:15,615
Please don't say no,

224
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,222
Vincent.

225
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:20,427
You're the only person I can trust.

226
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:22,849
And by the way,

227
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:25,474
this will be a secret
between the two of us.

228
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,229
You may go.

229
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:45,788
[door opens and closes]

230
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:52,420
[phone ringing]

231
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,116
Hon?

232
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,154
[Jave] Hon, sorry,
rain check for tonight.

233
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,299
Why?

234
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,932
Overtime.

235
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:09,767
I'll make it up to you.

236
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,086
Okay.

237
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:13,413
Bye.

238
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,438
Bye.

239
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,414
[intense music]

240
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:36,589
Stay put. [laughs]

241
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:42,470
[laughs]

242
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,832
So sexy.

243
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:01,948
[laughs]

244
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,555
[moans]

245
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:37,041
So hot.

246
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,619
[moaning continues]

247
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,173
What's that?

248
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:01,966
What's that gimmick?

249
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:06,763
Wait and see what
I'll do next. [laughs]

250
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:11,351
This looks exciting.

251
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:12,727
[laughs]

252
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:30,995
What's that?

253
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:47,525
[playful noises, moans]

254
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:50,729
Just wait... [laughs]

255
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,809
I'm getting excited.

256
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,773
Oh shit!

257
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:02,944
[moans loudly]

258
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:06,877
Can you take this off?

259
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:11,177
Come and get me!

260
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:12,870
[laughs loudly]

261
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:21,413
Where are you?

262
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,152
I can't stand this!

263
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,683
- Where are you?
- [door closes]

264
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,393
Hey!

265
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:37,645
Let me go!

266
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,870
Hey!

267
00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:41,271
[sighs]

268
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,129
[panting]

269
00:34:54,113 --> 00:35:00,119
[laughs]

270
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:12,608
Huh?

271
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,821
[club music]

272
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,273
[coughs, retching]

273
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:56,145
Stop moving.

274
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,144
Can't you keep still?

275
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,490
[vomits]

276
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:14,425
Ewww!

277
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,848
Gross!

278
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:17,617
Shut up!

279
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:18,878
Let's go home.

280
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,016
Don't you dare
throw up in my car.

281
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,541
[retching]

282
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:26,245
Miss, let me drive you home.

283
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:30,168
Why would I let you drive my car?

284
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:32,445
Why?

285
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:34,238
Who the hell are you?

286
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:38,921
Miss, you're wasted. Not one of
you is sober enough to drive.

287
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,728
Okay. [giggles]

288
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:47,682
But first, get me some vodka
from the bar.

289
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,089
Okay?

290
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:51,673
Give me your keys.

291
00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:53,950
Wait.

292
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:09,088
Ewww! [laughs]

293
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:15,303
[car engine revs]

294
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:25,322
[Vincent] Wait. Let me get out
of the vehicle first.

295
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,342
Careful.

296
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:34,976
Vin, I'm good.

297
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,319
I don't need your help.

298
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:38,948
And I'm not Vin.

299
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:40,465
I'm Vincent.

300
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:43,623
Vin, Vince, Vinny. Whatever.

301
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:45,359
Fine. Thanks, bye.

302
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:49,545
Are you sure you're okay?

303
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:52,840
Why?

304
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:58,286
You think I can't hold my liquor?

305
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:00,181
See, I'm holding it!

306
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:02,475
[chuckles]

307
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,936
Don't tell your mom
I gave you that.

308
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:07,480
Why?

309
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:09,481
Do you know my mom?

310
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,674
Fine. Your keys.

311
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:19,241
- Good night.
- Fine. Bye.

312
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:27,160
Go, Vincent! Shoot!

313
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:29,215
Come on, let's go!

314
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:32,574
Vincent is on fire!

315
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:34,769
Go!

316
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:37,623
Let's go!

317
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,743
Nice game, nice game.

318
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:41,769
- Nice game.
- He's good.

319
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:44,047
Nice game, nice game.
Take care, bro!

320
00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:47,561
[Bea] How was your class?

321
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:48,954
It's good.

322
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:51,065
The kids performance is commendable.

323
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:52,422
Oh? That's great!

324
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,236
I'm embarrassed.

325
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:57,316
- Okay, go ahead.
- Let's go!

326
00:38:58,631 --> 00:38:59,965
[school bell rings]

327
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,617
- Hello!
- You shoot well!

328
00:39:02,648 --> 00:39:04,011
Thank you, thank you.

329
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:05,349
- I get by.
- You're so sweaty.

330
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:07,623
- Are you tired?
- I'm okay.

331
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:08,833
Thirsty?

332
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,810
Yeah, I'm good.

333
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:12,962
I'm fine.

334
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,215
Go ahead.

335
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,801
I'll catch up with you guys.
We'll eat later.

336
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:21,679
- You're so handsome!
- Thank you.

337
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:23,289
Have you had dinner?

338
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:24,932
Not yet.

339
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:31,313
[Bea] What do you think
this school is?

340
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:33,315
A bar?

341
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:35,121
A club?

342
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:39,899
You flirt with the boys in public
and in broad daylight.

343
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:43,033
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

344
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,862
How flirtatious.

345
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:50,077
You better behave yourselves,
or I'll talk to your parents.

346
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:54,840
If you focus on boys,
and not on books,

347
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:57,565
your scholarships are in danger.

348
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,972
Ma'am, please, don't report
this to our parents.

349
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:03,161
We promise this won't
happen again, ma'am.

350
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:06,140
Okay.

351
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:10,352
I'll be lenient this time
since this is your first offense.

352
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:14,553
But if I catch you behaving
shamefully again,

353
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:17,079
there will be dire consequences.

354
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:39,167
Is dad home?

355
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:40,609
Erin...

356
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:44,484
can you please come when I ask
you to join us at dinner?

357
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:48,575
Now we'll have to reheat your food.

358
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:51,161
I'm not hungry.

359
00:40:51,227 --> 00:40:53,378
Besides, I didn't ask you to do that.

360
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,072
Don't you even want to eat with me?

361
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,712
Family should eat together.

362
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:04,022
It's our only chance to bond.

363
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:06,470
Why?

364
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,735
Are we a family?

365
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:12,873
The master of the house
isn't even here.

366
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:15,248
So, what's the point of bonding?

367
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:21,244
Dad! I've been waiting for you!

368
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,869
Uh, Erin,

369
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:24,416
I'm so sweaty.

370
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:26,022
Got stuck in traffic.

371
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:27,836
Join us.

372
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:29,714
We're just about to start dinner.

373
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,450
I'm fine. I got food
at a drive through.

374
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:36,988
I must shower.
I have an early day tomorrow.

375
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:45,868
By the way, I got my credit card bill.

376
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:47,855
You almost maxed it out.

377
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:49,535
If you keep this up,

378
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:50,909
I'll cut you off.

379
00:42:23,261 --> 00:42:27,295
Quiet! You're in a library!
And you're so loud.

380
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:34,288
Psst! Psst!

381
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,480
Shit! Sorry!

382
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:01,296
What the hell, Vincent!

383
00:43:01,443 --> 00:43:03,123
You're such a klutz!

384
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:06,171
This is the second time
this happened.

385
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:09,254
Oh, it's you. I'm sorry.

386
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:11,507
I didn't mean it.

387
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,269
Okay, fine.

388
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,560
[whispering] Where is it?

389
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:23,504
What are you looking for?

390
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:24,897
Maybe I can help.

391
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:29,332
There! I finally found it.

392
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:31,011
That's it.

393
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:33,890
- The one with the green cover.
- This one?

394
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:34,956
Yes.

395
00:43:36,976 --> 00:43:39,853
What else? I'll get it for you.

396
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:45,173
You know what Vincent,

397
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:47,941
I have a big problem with you.

398
00:43:50,114 --> 00:43:51,929
What's wrong?

399
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:56,061
You're so polite.

400
00:43:57,045 --> 00:43:59,760
That's so outdated.

401
00:44:22,312 --> 00:44:24,106
- Come here.
- Wait, Erin.

402
00:45:02,603 --> 00:45:05,731
[grunts and moans]

403
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:22,790
More... Get down there.

404
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:40,349
Ah, shit!

405
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:51,443
[grunts and moans]

406
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:57,324
More.

407
00:46:03,038 --> 00:46:04,581
[loud moans]

408
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,418
Oh, shit.

409
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:25,059
Oh, shit.

410
00:46:35,946 --> 00:46:37,322
Oh, shit.

411
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:45,497
[groans and moans]

412
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:54,423
- [Vincent] Taste it.
- [Erin] What's that?

413
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:55,864
Come on!

414
00:46:59,678 --> 00:47:01,305
- It's yummy.
- Yummy?

415
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:06,810
Something going on over there.

416
00:47:11,315 --> 00:47:12,900
[knocks on door]

417
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:17,045
[Vincent] Good morning, ma'am.

418
00:47:19,323 --> 00:47:21,797
Looks like you haven't been doing
the assignment I gave you.

419
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:24,346
You're doing something else instead.

420
00:47:26,132 --> 00:47:27,132
Ma'am?

421
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:31,912
You haven't been reporting
to me about Erin.

422
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:33,587
Ma'am...

423
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:36,239
there's not really much to report.

424
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:40,508
Is she still hanging out at that bar?

425
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:43,678
Yes ma'am, every weekend.

426
00:47:44,968 --> 00:47:46,306
Who is she with?

427
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,851
Her friends.

428
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:52,054
Boyfriend?

429
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:55,106
I haven't seen a boyfriend.

430
00:47:55,131 --> 00:47:58,163
Just some guys
they meet at the bar.

431
00:47:58,723 --> 00:48:00,073
So, the guys pick them up?

432
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:02,988
Not really, ma'am.

433
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:07,636
They just hang out and dance.

434
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,023
How about you?

435
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,656
Don't you talk to her?

436
00:48:15,463 --> 00:48:16,487
Dance with her?

437
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:18,757
Or...

438
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:21,522
court her?

439
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,481
I'm busy at the bar.

440
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:32,145
Okay,

441
00:48:32,688 --> 00:48:34,564
give me your bank details.

442
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,770
- I will deposit--
- There's no need for that, ma'am.

443
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:38,694
Thank you.

444
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,969
No, Vince.

445
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,442
I need to pay you,

446
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,902
so that you will have to report
to me once a week.

447
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:56,336
[Erin] Well...

448
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:58,505
will you go with me or not?

449
00:48:58,588 --> 00:49:01,313
[videocall] I told you I'm not sure.

450
00:49:01,466 --> 00:49:03,366
I have to check my schedule.

451
00:49:03,427 --> 00:49:05,681
Tell me now!

452
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:08,875
I can always make time.

453
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:10,608
Alright, bye.

454
00:49:12,634 --> 00:49:14,293
Okay. Bye.

455
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:16,653
Erin?

456
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:19,754
You've been behaving like slut again.

457
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:24,177
Gosh!

458
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:25,738
What's this?

459
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:29,591
Another one of your lectures?

460
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:32,837
Someone saw you

461
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:36,168
a few days ago, making out
with another student,

462
00:49:36,193 --> 00:49:39,313
in the library of all places.

463
00:49:39,584 --> 00:49:40,628
So?

464
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:42,576
Where should I do that?

465
00:49:42,716 --> 00:49:45,053
In the toilet?
The locker room?

466
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:49,079
Don't you realize that
your reputation

467
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:52,556
also affects my reputation
as a Guidance Counselor?

468
00:49:53,602 --> 00:49:55,490
Let's make a deal, okay?

469
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:59,414
What I do in my school is my business.

470
00:49:59,649 --> 00:50:03,350
What you do in your office
is your business.

471
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:05,894
Don't judge me and
I won't judge you.

472
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:08,046
Otherwise,

473
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:10,870
I'll do worse things that can

474
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:12,485
damage your reputation.

475
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,758
Whatever that is.

476
00:50:35,894 --> 00:50:37,521
Care for wine, sir?

477
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:40,506
Um, I'll have some sake please.

478
00:50:40,732 --> 00:50:41,775
Okay, sir.

479
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:46,571
So, who chose this restaurant?

480
00:50:47,364 --> 00:50:48,497
Your daughter.

481
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:50,329
Of course.

482
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:53,542
If the place is expensive,
then it's Erin's idea.

483
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:56,367
She said it's her treat.

484
00:50:56,516 --> 00:50:58,843
Her treat using my credit card.

485
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:03,229
There's better be a special occasion
to warrant a place like this.

486
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,567
Dad! Mom!

487
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,348
Sorry to keep you waiting.

488
00:51:09,386 --> 00:51:10,837
Traffic as usual.

489
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,669
Um, I'd like you to meet
my boyfriend, Vincent.

490
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:17,995
Good evening, sir, ma'am.

491
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,493
Sit down.

492
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:31,031
You didn't tell us that
you have a new boyfriend.

493
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:32,868
Since when?

494
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,426
Maybe...

495
00:51:35,036 --> 00:51:37,036
a week and a half.

496
00:51:37,456 --> 00:51:38,595
So how's that work?

497
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,851
You change boyfriends as often
as you change your pa—

498
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:41,921
Jave.

499
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:43,789
pajamas?

500
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,759
Huh? Where's the other guy?

501
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:47,816
What's his name, the jerk?

502
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,010
Buddy?

503
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:50,774
He's gone.

504
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:53,057
I got bored with him.

505
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:55,227
You didn't like him anyway.

506
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:57,995
It's not that.

507
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,877
I just don't want you
to have a boyfriend.

508
00:52:12,385 --> 00:52:13,901
Are you ready to order, sir?

509
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:15,410
Give us five minutes.

510
00:52:15,435 --> 00:52:16,448
Okay, sir.

511
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:23,985
So Vincent,

512
00:52:24,245 --> 00:52:25,479
tell us about yourself.

513
00:52:25,754 --> 00:52:26,999
What's your background?

514
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:28,573
Where is your family from?

515
00:52:28,637 --> 00:52:29,960
Where do you live?

516
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:32,199
What do you do?

517
00:52:32,518 --> 00:52:33,601
Where do you study?

518
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,774
Dad!

519
00:52:34,846 --> 00:52:38,975
You're interrogating Vincent
like he's a criminal!

520
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,976
But isn't that why
you brought him here?

521
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:45,062
To get to know him?

522
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:47,526
Uh sir,

523
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:49,692
I'm from Sta. Mesa.

524
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:52,770
Third year college.

525
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:54,773
Athletic scholar by day,

526
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,296
bartender by night.

527
00:52:56,576 --> 00:52:58,058
My dad's a mechanic,

528
00:52:58,662 --> 00:53:00,107
my mom's a housewife.

529
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:03,323
I have three other siblings.

530
00:53:03,943 --> 00:53:06,894
I send my youngest sibling to school.

531
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:08,748
My grandma

532
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,338
lives with us.

533
00:53:13,009 --> 00:53:14,303
She's 81 years old,

534
00:53:15,637 --> 00:53:16,713
and has cancer.

535
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:22,253
She needs chemotherapy
every two weeks.

536
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:27,302
And you think you're suited
for my daughter

537
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:28,869
with that kind of background?

538
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,032
Dad,

539
00:53:31,377 --> 00:53:34,502
Vincent is very ambitious.
Just like you.

540
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:37,357
Okay, okay, so what's your goal?

541
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:41,330
To be the CEO of the
top insurance company?

542
00:53:41,866 --> 00:53:43,900
To be the President
of the Philippines?

543
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:45,520
No, sir.

544
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:49,645
To be a good mechanic

545
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:51,879
like my father.

546
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,723
I think I just lost my appetite.

547
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:02,779
Waiter!

548
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:07,197
We're ready to order.

549
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:13,461
- [Jave] I don't care!
- [Bea] Jave, keep your voice down.

550
00:54:13,486 --> 00:54:14,738
[Bea] They can hear you.

551
00:54:14,763 --> 00:54:15,972
[Jave] We're going to bed!

552
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:19,612
Deal with Erin and his no good
leech of a boyfriend!

553
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:20,655
The coast is clear.

554
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,025
They're going to sleep.

555
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:27,963
Success!

556
00:54:28,108 --> 00:54:31,906
You put on quite a show, Vincent.

557
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:36,139
Dad's raving about
your credentials.

558
00:54:37,093 --> 00:54:39,012
“My father is a mechanic…

559
00:54:39,037 --> 00:54:40,721
mother's a housewife,

560
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:43,091
we're from Sta. Mesa…”

561
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:46,543
My God. Did you see
my dad's reaction?

562
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:48,296
He almost got drunk.

563
00:54:51,434 --> 00:54:52,501
But you know what,

564
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:54,948
everything I said is true.

565
00:54:55,445 --> 00:54:56,471
Oh?

566
00:54:57,232 --> 00:54:58,506
Except for one.

567
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:02,219
That your ambition is to be
a mechanic like your dad?

568
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:04,204
No.

569
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:06,022
About my grandma–

570
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:07,676
that she's still living with us.

571
00:55:09,232 --> 00:55:10,384
Actually...

572
00:55:11,924 --> 00:55:13,227
she died many years ago.

573
00:55:15,006 --> 00:55:16,586
You're crazy.

574
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:18,330
Are you serious?

575
00:55:21,245 --> 00:55:22,679
Not as crazy as you.

576
00:56:03,388 --> 00:56:06,850
[grunts and moans]

577
00:57:06,477 --> 00:57:09,397
You're Erin's watchdog,

578
00:57:09,422 --> 00:57:10,988
you're not supposed
to ‘attack' her.

579
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,529
I trusted you Vincent.

580
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:21,291
But you're taking advantage
of my daughter!

581
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:24,886
I'm sorry, ma'am.

582
00:57:25,178 --> 00:57:26,805
You better explain yourself.

583
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:29,098
You know damn well
what I can do

584
00:57:29,123 --> 00:57:30,490
to your scholarship.

585
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:32,547
Ma'am...

586
00:57:33,102 --> 00:57:35,191
we're beginning to like each other.

587
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:37,557
So please,

588
00:57:38,173 --> 00:57:40,890
I'd rather stop doing the
assignment you gave me.

589
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,954
I don't want to lie to her.

590
00:57:45,643 --> 00:57:48,688
[laughs]

591
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:53,078
You're more naive
than I thought, Vincent.

592
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:57,744
Erin is the one
taking you for a fool.

593
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:01,105
Taking advantage of you,

594
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,715
and your gullibility.

595
00:58:03,758 --> 00:58:05,426
She's just using you

596
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:07,764
to get her dad's attention.

597
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:10,305
I'm sorry, ma'am.

598
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:12,904
I don't understand.

599
00:58:12,976 --> 00:58:15,478
Of course you won't,

600
00:58:15,645 --> 00:58:17,811
because you're not
a psychologist.

601
00:58:18,857 --> 00:58:20,922
I am the only one

602
00:58:21,113 --> 00:58:24,700
who can understand
Erin's behavioral patterns.

603
00:58:25,114 --> 00:58:29,666
I am the only one who
can see through her.

604
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,037
So, what am I supposed
to do now?

605
00:58:34,038 --> 00:58:36,082
I'm beginning to
have feelings for her.

606
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:40,044
Well, the deed is done.

607
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,743
Just go on with whatever
your relationship is.

608
00:58:44,716 --> 00:58:47,076
Just make sure she won't notice
what you're up to.

609
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,847
Nothing changes with
the way you treat her.

610
00:58:51,472 --> 00:58:54,134
And our deal remains a deal.

611
00:58:54,684 --> 00:58:57,777
You will continue to
report to me once a week

612
00:58:57,832 --> 00:58:59,459
without fail.

613
00:59:00,273 --> 00:59:01,524
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:08,960
And one last condition.

615
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:14,662
Never ever fall in
love with my daughter.

616
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:17,498
Is that clear?

617
00:59:28,217 --> 00:59:29,427
[door closes]

618
01:01:13,906 --> 01:01:15,116
[Jave] Hon?

619
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,303
You're home early!

620
01:01:23,184 --> 01:01:24,437
Why are you naked?

621
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:27,957
It's hot in here.

622
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:30,700
Bea,

623
01:01:30,893 --> 01:01:32,494
that's what the AC is for.

624
01:03:11,149 --> 01:03:12,859
Wait! Wait!

625
01:03:13,596 --> 01:03:14,604
Wait!

626
01:03:15,027 --> 01:03:16,077
No!

627
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:17,458
[screams]

628
01:03:21,576 --> 01:03:22,994
What do you mean wait? Huh?

629
01:03:23,035 --> 01:03:24,245
- No!
- You can't do that!

630
01:03:24,245 --> 01:03:25,955
[slaps, cries]

631
01:03:28,577 --> 01:03:29,583
No!

632
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:36,863
No!

633
01:03:37,758 --> 01:03:39,051
[rips clothes]

634
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:43,383
No! No!

635
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:45,313
You can't do that, no!

636
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:47,927
[cries hysterically]

637
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,020
No! Stop!

638
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:58,965
No!

639
01:03:59,197 --> 01:04:01,324
No!

640
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:16,883
No!

641
01:04:20,238 --> 01:04:21,238
No!

642
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,272
No!

643
01:04:28,976 --> 01:04:30,561
[grunts]

644
01:04:30,586 --> 01:04:32,299
[cries hysterically]

645
01:04:33,682 --> 01:04:34,682
No!

646
01:04:40,427 --> 01:04:41,633
No!

647
01:04:45,993 --> 01:04:48,371
[loud grunts]

648
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:47,430
[phone rings]

649
01:05:56,644 --> 01:05:58,280
- Bea?
- Hon?

650
01:06:04,472 --> 01:06:06,182
Where are you? It's...

651
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:08,184
two in the morning.

652
01:06:08,492 --> 01:06:10,453
Sorry I didn't inform you

653
01:06:10,828 --> 01:06:13,581
that we had an admin
emergency meeting

654
01:06:13,873 --> 01:06:16,625
and we had so many issues
to discuss.

655
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:18,669
I'm so tired to drive.

656
01:06:19,003 --> 01:06:23,341
I decided to spend the night
here in BGC.

657
01:06:23,632 --> 01:06:24,676
Oh...

658
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:28,387
I guess we'll miss each other then.

659
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:29,965
[Bea] Why?

660
01:06:30,604 --> 01:06:34,024
I have a business trip,
short notice.

661
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:35,884
Six a.m. flight to Cebu.

662
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,956
Okay.

663
01:06:39,815 --> 01:06:41,525
See you then when you get back.

664
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:44,053
Have a safe trip. Bye.

665
01:06:44,403 --> 01:06:45,461
Okay, bye.

666
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:24,402
[Erin] You didn't even say goodbye!

667
01:07:26,714 --> 01:07:28,716
When I woke up, you were gone!

668
01:07:31,117 --> 01:07:33,119
You should've told me!

669
01:07:36,493 --> 01:07:38,495
How long will you be in Cebu?

670
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:43,370
That's too long!

671
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:45,539
Dad!

672
01:07:46,173 --> 01:07:47,925
I'm going to miss you!

673
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,835
You should've
brought me with you!

674
01:07:55,194 --> 01:07:56,236
You know what?

675
01:07:57,667 --> 01:07:59,044
I hate you!

676
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:02,356
I really hate you!

677
01:08:03,482 --> 01:08:06,152
- Hey Erin, what's the problem?
- Go home.

678
01:08:07,153 --> 01:08:08,504
What's the problem?

679
01:08:08,529 --> 01:08:10,308
Just leave me alone!

680
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,637
You're such a pest!
Didn't I tell you to go?

681
01:08:14,743 --> 01:08:15,995
God!

682
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,595
[knocks on door]

683
01:08:41,395 --> 01:08:42,563
Hey!

684
01:08:42,588 --> 01:08:44,131
Buddy!

685
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:48,152
Perfect timing.

686
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:49,695
Join us!

687
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,740
- Erin!
- Hi!

688
01:08:52,765 --> 01:08:54,454
Come here.

689
01:08:54,867 --> 01:08:58,454
Have a drink.
Take one.

690
01:09:02,082 --> 01:09:03,083
Just one!

691
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:05,166
Aunty!

692
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:06,270
Hi Aunty!

693
01:09:06,295 --> 01:09:08,047
Aunty, come here!

694
01:09:08,072 --> 01:09:09,823
You want some candy?

695
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:11,759
I love you, aunty!

696
01:09:33,678 --> 01:09:35,823
Vince, thanks for coming.

697
01:09:36,746 --> 01:09:38,623
I didn't know what to do.

698
01:09:40,204 --> 01:09:41,211
Wait,

699
01:09:41,273 --> 01:09:42,691
what happened to you?

700
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:44,833
Who did this to you?

701
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:46,500
My…

702
01:09:52,269 --> 01:09:53,521
my husband.

703
01:10:01,892 --> 01:10:04,144
He forced himself to me.

704
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:08,075
I rejected him.

705
01:10:11,652 --> 01:10:13,248
He almost killed me.

706
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:21,135
This is not the first time
it happened.

707
01:10:22,329 --> 01:10:26,143
I thought I'd die.

708
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:36,862
I don't love him anymore.

709
01:10:37,886 --> 01:10:39,802
I've been putting up
with him for so long.

710
01:10:45,686 --> 01:10:46,770
Don't cry.

711
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:50,010
Stop thinking about him.

712
01:10:51,473 --> 01:10:53,100
You're a good guy.

713
01:10:57,906 --> 01:11:00,117
Erin is lucky to have you.

714
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:04,413
You're good for her.

715
01:11:06,498 --> 01:11:08,542
I'm not sure about that, ma'am.

716
01:11:09,752 --> 01:11:10,769
Huh?

717
01:11:11,879 --> 01:11:12,930
Why?

718
01:11:13,005 --> 01:11:14,030
What happened?

719
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:17,593
Erin...

720
01:11:17,885 --> 01:11:19,845
wants to break up with me.

721
01:11:24,058 --> 01:11:25,809
I told you...

722
01:11:27,561 --> 01:11:29,438
she just took advantage of you,

723
01:11:29,647 --> 01:11:31,565
like she did the other guys.

724
01:11:34,818 --> 01:11:35,944
Look at you.

725
01:11:37,696 --> 01:11:39,531
You don't deserve it, Vincent.

726
01:11:45,287 --> 01:11:47,957
Now we're both battered.

727
01:15:24,548 --> 01:15:29,219

728
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:56,038
[door opens]

729
01:15:58,624 --> 01:15:59,750
Ma'am!

730
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:01,208
Yes?

731
01:16:01,335 --> 01:16:03,170
You're home!

732
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:06,191
Erin hasn't been home
for three days!

733
01:16:07,674 --> 01:16:09,343
Why didn't you tell me?

734
01:16:09,368 --> 01:16:10,651
Did you tell my husband?

735
01:16:10,759 --> 01:16:13,822
We weren't sure if
we should tell him.

736
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:16,241
We thought that maybe
you knew about it.

737
01:16:16,266 --> 01:16:19,603
We called her cellphone,
but she wasn't picking up.

738
01:16:19,628 --> 01:16:21,264
So we got worried.

739
01:16:32,824 --> 01:16:35,369
[phone rings]

740
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:46,004
We're sorry. The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

[knocks on door]

743
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:00,722
- Who are you?
- Where's Erin?

744
01:18:00,747 --> 01:18:01,831
There's no Erin here.

745
01:18:02,062 --> 01:18:03,515
What do you mean
she's not here?

746
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:04,556
Erin?

747
01:18:05,321 --> 01:18:06,377
Erin!

748
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:07,936
Hey!

749
01:18:08,795 --> 01:18:10,630
- What are you doing?
- Leave her alone!

750
01:18:10,655 --> 01:18:12,466
- Hi!
- Erin, let's go!

751
01:18:12,491 --> 01:18:14,470
Mind your own business!

752
01:18:15,135 --> 01:18:16,289
Asshole! [punches]

753
01:18:16,428 --> 01:18:17,609
You jerk!

754
01:18:18,346 --> 01:18:20,515
[kicks and punches]

755
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:24,040
- No!
- Go, go!

756
01:18:27,824 --> 01:18:29,389
No, stop!

757
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,889
- [police siren]
- Stop!

758
01:18:36,566 --> 01:18:38,151
Police!

759
01:18:45,151 --> 01:18:46,171
Damn you!

760
01:18:46,196 --> 01:18:47,988
[gunshots]

761
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:54,184
Get out!

762
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:56,097
Buddy!

763
01:18:59,614 --> 01:19:00,724
Buddy!

764
01:19:36,508 --> 01:19:37,968
[faucet running]

765
01:19:40,512 --> 01:19:41,972
[Jave] Hon, I'm home!

766
01:19:45,644 --> 01:19:46,743
Jave?

767
01:19:46,847 --> 01:19:50,726
Sorry, my flight was twenty-four
hours delayed.

768
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:52,289
Okay.

769
01:19:54,087 --> 01:19:55,304
I'm coming!

770
01:19:56,903 --> 01:20:01,032
[phone rings]

771
01:20:08,381 --> 01:20:09,382
Hello?

772
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:12,118
[Dean] Uh, hello, can I speak
with Bea please?

773
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:15,814
Uh yes, Dean Benitez.
This is Jave.

774
01:20:15,886 --> 01:20:18,055
Bea is in the shower right now.

775
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:19,361
Can I take a message?

776
01:20:19,408 --> 01:20:20,416
Jave,

777
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:24,639
I just want to check up on Bea

778
01:20:24,664 --> 01:20:26,826
after the incident this morning.

779
01:20:29,001 --> 01:20:30,556
What incident?

780
01:20:30,896 --> 01:20:34,850
Oh, uh, sorry you didn't know.

781
01:20:35,066 --> 01:20:38,935
I just got home from Cebu
a few minutes ago.

782
01:20:39,321 --> 01:20:42,115
Well I'm sure Bea's
going to tell you about it.

783
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:46,728
Apparently, there was a drug raid
at a condo this morning.

784
01:20:46,995 --> 01:20:49,706
Bea, Erin, Buddy

785
01:20:49,731 --> 01:20:52,459
and another student named
Vincent Garrido, were involved.

786
01:20:52,484 --> 01:20:55,951
Vincent was beat up,
and is currently in the hospital.

787
01:20:56,379 --> 01:20:58,965
I just wanted to
check on Bea and Erin.

788
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,742
I want to know if they're alright.

789
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:04,533
They haven't come to school
these past few days.

790
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,556
Ahh...

791
01:21:07,224 --> 01:21:09,160
Okay, okay.

792
01:21:09,392 --> 01:21:11,770
Uh, thanks for the concern.

793
01:21:11,795 --> 01:21:12,921
Um...

794
01:21:13,897 --> 01:21:15,357
I think they're okay.

795
01:21:15,382 --> 01:21:17,944
Um, I'll tell Bea.

796
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:19,589
Thank you, Dean.

797
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:21,254
Alright, thank you.

798
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:22,607
Good night.

799
01:21:23,156 --> 01:21:24,236
Good night.

800
01:21:56,648 --> 01:22:01,027
[moans]

801
01:22:14,582 --> 01:22:17,502
[heart rate monitor beeps]

802
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:17,470
[Bea] So...

803
01:23:17,495 --> 01:23:19,706
when do you think the patient
will wake up?

804
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:22,691
That's great.

805
01:23:22,716 --> 01:23:25,379
Okay, let me know if
there are any changes

806
01:23:25,456 --> 01:23:27,083
in the next 24 hours.

807
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,067
Yes, this is my number.

808
01:23:29,574 --> 01:23:31,284
Thank you very much, doctor.

809
01:23:36,373 --> 01:23:39,142
Why are you so overly concerned
about the patient?

810
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,979
And you're never concerned at all.

811
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:47,746
Not once did you check on
Vincent at the hospital.

812
01:23:48,426 --> 01:23:50,762
His face was bashed in

813
01:23:51,721 --> 01:23:54,099
by your druggie friends!

814
01:23:54,557 --> 01:23:57,977
No! Because it's his fault
that Buddy's dead!

815
01:23:58,603 --> 01:24:00,189
I'm sure he was the
one who called the police

816
01:24:00,213 --> 01:24:01,881
to raid Buddy's condo.

817
01:24:02,607 --> 01:24:03,901
Because he wants to get back at me

818
01:24:03,925 --> 01:24:05,385
for breaking up with him!

819
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:06,883
Erin!

820
01:24:07,045 --> 01:24:08,906
You're making false accusations!

821
01:24:09,642 --> 01:24:11,477
Buddy's condo is a drug den.

822
01:24:11,725 --> 01:24:13,268
That's why it was raided.

823
01:24:14,077 --> 01:24:15,453
Don't think that I don't know

824
01:24:15,478 --> 01:24:17,513
why Vincent knew
where to find me.

825
01:24:17,964 --> 01:24:20,162
He's been following me around.

826
01:24:20,615 --> 01:24:22,450
Watching me like a hawk.

827
01:24:23,336 --> 01:24:26,089
At first, I thought
he really loved me.

828
01:24:26,339 --> 01:24:28,191
That he was just
being protective,

829
01:24:28,216 --> 01:24:29,509
and possessive.

830
01:24:31,136 --> 01:24:33,805
But I realized that he was
just stalking me.

831
01:24:34,472 --> 01:24:36,766
Even on the days
when we're not together.

832
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,436
That guy is a creep and pervert!

833
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:42,063
I have to go to class.

834
01:24:42,564 --> 01:24:44,763
We'll continue this discussion at home!

835
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:46,218
No!

836
01:24:46,943 --> 01:24:50,655
This discussion ends
here right now!

837
01:24:51,322 --> 01:24:55,160
I'm allowing you reprimand me
here in your office

838
01:24:55,185 --> 01:24:57,854
because you're acting
as my guidance counselor.

839
01:24:58,455 --> 01:24:59,664
But at home,

840
01:25:00,373 --> 01:25:02,251
you can't act like my mom,

841
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,711
because you're not my mother!

842
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:06,477
I tried to, Erin,

843
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:10,467
- ever since you were a little girl!
- Yes! Ever since I was a little girl!

844
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:15,838
When you stole my dad
from my mom!

845
01:25:17,765 --> 01:25:18,933
Poor daddy,

846
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:21,853
he thought that he would be
happier if he chose you.

847
01:25:22,103 --> 01:25:25,899
Until he realized that he didn't
love you after all.

848
01:25:26,024 --> 01:25:29,402
That you had manipulated him

849
01:25:29,427 --> 01:25:32,486
into leaving my mom for you.

850
01:25:32,697 --> 01:25:37,994
And now, I'm the casualty of this
war between you and Dad,

851
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,915
because his life with you
became miserable,

852
01:25:42,499 --> 01:25:45,585
and he no longer knew how
to love his daughter.

853
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,449
Erin!

854
01:25:52,973 --> 01:25:54,058
[door slams]

855
01:26:38,221 --> 01:26:39,514
[Bea] Dean,

856
01:26:39,889 --> 01:26:41,766
my resignation letter.

857
01:26:49,312 --> 01:26:50,522
Are you sure Bea?

858
01:26:50,547 --> 01:26:52,443
I've already recommended you as

859
01:26:52,468 --> 01:26:55,096
Director for Student Affairs.

860
01:26:55,989 --> 01:26:57,046
Dean,

861
01:26:57,516 --> 01:27:00,102
I'm sure you've been hearing
about negative things

862
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:03,016
about my performance
for the last few months.

863
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:06,022
I have a lot of problems
to take care of--

864
01:27:06,303 --> 01:27:07,513
personal,

865
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:09,559
family problems.

866
01:27:10,252 --> 01:27:11,686
I apologize.

867
01:27:13,659 --> 01:27:15,225
I regret to admit that

868
01:27:15,634 --> 01:27:19,388
I've been taking it out on
the students I'm counseling.

869
01:27:21,739 --> 01:27:22,928
Actually,

870
01:27:23,389 --> 01:27:26,648
I've been hearing complaints

871
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,694
from girls

872
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:30,798
because of how

873
01:27:30,857 --> 01:27:31,858
you reprimand them

874
01:27:31,883 --> 01:27:35,219
even if they're just hanging out
with their male classmates.

875
01:27:35,565 --> 01:27:38,735
I tried to understand
your attitude because

876
01:27:38,985 --> 01:27:41,195
I know how principled you are.

877
01:27:41,787 --> 01:27:43,664
Dean, I appreciate that but...

878
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:45,684
like I said,

879
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:49,432
I'm not fit for the position
you're offering.

880
01:27:50,143 --> 01:27:51,686
That's why I'm requesting

881
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:53,797
my resignation to be effective

882
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,244
immediately.

883
01:28:30,124 --> 01:28:33,002
Going on another one
of your business trips?

884
01:28:35,132 --> 01:28:36,194
Yup.

885
01:28:37,502 --> 01:28:40,882
Why don't we ever go on
trips together?

886
01:28:41,432 --> 01:28:43,267
Like regular families do.

887
01:28:43,596 --> 01:28:44,619
Erin.

888
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:47,371
I just need some
time for myself, okay?

889
01:28:49,936 --> 01:28:51,104
For how long?

890
01:28:52,397 --> 01:28:53,435
Who knows.

891
01:28:54,525 --> 01:28:57,486
One month, six months, one year?

892
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,465
By the time you return,

893
01:29:00,748 --> 01:29:02,108
I've probably already given birth.

894
01:29:05,571 --> 01:29:06,774
Yes, Dad!

895
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,801
I'm pregnant!

896
01:29:09,242 --> 01:29:10,474
Surprised?

897
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:23,566
[slaps]

898
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:33,396
So,

899
01:29:34,147 --> 01:29:36,274
I finally got your attention.

900
01:29:37,275 --> 01:29:38,818
Who did this to you?

901
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:41,069
Huh? That...

902
01:29:41,474 --> 01:29:45,669
good for nothing miserable
loser you call your boyfriend?

903
01:29:47,228 --> 01:29:48,235
Actually,

904
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,421
I'm not sure.

905
01:29:51,496 --> 01:29:54,342
It could also be my miserable

906
01:29:54,367 --> 01:29:57,061
good for nothing ex-boyfriend,

907
01:29:57,086 --> 01:29:58,086
Buddy.

908
01:30:05,762 --> 01:30:09,020
You will salvage
your reputation, okay?

909
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:13,227
I won't let you ruin the good image

910
01:30:13,378 --> 01:30:15,588
I built for our family.

911
01:30:16,647 --> 01:30:19,859
I will not have a bastard
as a grandson.

912
01:30:20,943 --> 01:30:24,781
You will marry the father
of that baby!

913
01:30:26,282 --> 01:30:28,075
Are you serious, Dad?

914
01:30:29,994 --> 01:30:32,455
Who of the two candidates
should I marry?

915
01:30:33,289 --> 01:30:35,208
One is in a coma,

916
01:30:35,233 --> 01:30:38,582
and the other is six feet underground.

917
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:40,282
So,

918
01:30:41,255 --> 01:30:43,703
if you don't want a bastard grandson,

919
01:30:44,592 --> 01:30:48,190
I think the best solution
is to have an abortion.

920
01:30:53,392 --> 01:30:55,269
[angry screams]

921
01:31:01,218 --> 01:31:03,095
[continues to scream]

922
01:31:10,326 --> 01:31:12,620
[hospital monitor beeps]

923
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:32,736
Vincent!

924
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:02,169
Miss Erin, please get ready
in 30 minutes.

925
01:32:03,838 --> 01:32:06,340
Ms. Kath, they need you at Room One.

926
01:32:21,788 --> 01:32:24,582
Men like you
are like despots,

927
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:26,535
or dictators.

928
01:32:27,215 --> 01:32:28,592
Which do you prefer?

929
01:32:30,675 --> 01:32:32,174
Are you taking it against me

930
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,239
that I'm just doing what
I think is best

931
01:32:34,264 --> 01:32:35,474
for my daughter?

932
01:32:36,437 --> 01:32:39,399
Have you ever asked her
what she wants?

933
01:32:40,102 --> 01:32:42,938
Why are you the one
deciding for her?

934
01:32:44,491 --> 01:32:45,535
I know Erin.

935
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,139
She's not capable of making her
own decisions.

936
01:32:50,873 --> 01:32:52,291
She needs to be disciplined.

937
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:54,401
She needs to be controlled.

938
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,696
So you're forcing her
to get married

939
01:32:56,827 --> 01:32:58,478
just because she got pregnant?

940
01:32:58,610 --> 01:32:59,687
Well,

941
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:03,112
that's only the consequence
of her bad behavior.

942
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:05,504
That girl needs to learn her lesson,

943
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:07,879
just like I'm learning my lesson

944
01:33:09,147 --> 01:33:12,216
because of a mistake
I made years ago.

945
01:33:15,327 --> 01:33:17,370
And you're punishing me for it!

946
01:33:18,901 --> 01:33:21,820
Because you left your wife for me!

947
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,672
After the wedding,

948
01:33:29,215 --> 01:33:31,724
Erin and Vincent will live abroad.

949
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,512
That's also where she will give birth.

950
01:33:35,262 --> 01:33:37,647
And so that you won't be able
to see Vincent anymore.

951
01:33:40,893 --> 01:33:42,349
After this wedding,

952
01:33:42,812 --> 01:33:44,502
I'm leaving you!

953
01:33:49,026 --> 01:33:50,820
[door knocks]

954
01:33:51,586 --> 01:33:53,489
Ma'am Bea, Erin is missing!

955
01:33:54,124 --> 01:33:55,137
What?

956
01:34:15,972 --> 01:34:20,307
[Bea] I'm sorry, I can't do this.

957
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:26,621
This is my entire future

958
01:34:26,646 --> 01:34:29,940
and I want to be the one
to decide how I will live it.

959
01:34:31,812 --> 01:34:32,980
Don't worry,

960
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,893
I will keep the baby,

961
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:37,167
even if I have to raise it,

962
01:34:38,034 --> 01:34:39,869
as a single mom.

963
01:34:43,982 --> 01:34:45,025
Please,

964
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:47,972
don't look for me.

965
01:34:48,505 --> 01:34:49,881
I'll be fine.

966
01:34:50,108 --> 01:34:51,151
Erin.

967
01:36:38,154 --> 01:36:40,781
[car engine starts]

968
01:37:07,349 --> 01:37:09,977
[motorcycle arrives]
