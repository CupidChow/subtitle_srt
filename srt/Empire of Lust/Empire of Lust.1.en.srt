foreign intrusion and the issue

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,250
YEAR OF 1398
7TH YEAR UNDER KING TAEJO'S REIGN
Now when we founded this new kingdom
to renew the nation breaking the old evil,

15
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,730
if the founding contributors of nation
still possess the private army

16
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,370
this is evidently nothing but
an absurd act

17
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,870
which can disperse and weaken
the nation's power.

18
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,640
Therefore, your majesty, we should
vest all the private armies

19
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,010
in the great army
to reunite the military strength

20
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,720
LORD SAMBONG, JUNG DO-JEON
and have the battle formation drill
be proceeded without delay.

21
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,420
and have the battle formation drill
be proceeded without delay.

JO JOON
lf tens of thousands of soldiers
start training suddenly,

23
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,360
it would invite the unecessary
misunderstanding by the Great Ming.

24
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,890
KING TAEJO
it would invite the unecessary
misunderstanding by the Great Ming.

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,860
We cannot afford that.

26
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,000
So does your lordship
the first vice-premier put

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,440
the Great Ming's mood
ahead of our own interest?

28
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,810
HA RYOON
Then would you rather
want this country to suffer war?

29
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,610
Watch your mouth!
How dare you...

30
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,940
You all be quiet!

31
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,380
We just founded the new kingdom.

32
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,350
And how can't everyone
unite the mind for the country?

33
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,020
Your majesty.

34
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
The supreme commander
Jo Young-gyu

35
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,690
and commander of Right Army
Kim Min-jae request an audience.

36
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,820
Granted.

37
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,210
Your humble subject, Jo Young-gyu
completed the mission of subjugating

38
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,840
the northern saveages
indebted to your royal favor.

39
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,780
Welcome back!
You must've suffered many hardships.

40
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,220
Commander of the right army, Kim Min-jae
pay a low reverence to your majesty.

41
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,780
l was informed about your
distinguished service at this battle.

42
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,810
Much pleasure is with me
when l see you

43
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,860
as you remind me as a young man.

44
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,160
- Lord First Vice-Premier.
- Your majesty.

45
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,700
You lead to console and
encourage with a celebration

46
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,800
the two commanders
who brought us big victory.

47
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,830
As you command, your majesty.

48
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,910
First call is 20 silver coins,
20 coins anyone?

49
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,790
- Twenty!
- We have 20!

50
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,360
21 anyone?

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,290
- 21 !
- Good, 21 from the gentleman.

52
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,420
Anyone calling 22?
22 silver conins!

53
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,570
Look who is here!

54
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
lsn't this Commander Kim who
won the deadly battle in the north?

55
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,600
ROYAL PRINCE JUNG-AN,
LEE BANG-WON
lsn't this Commander Kim who
won the deadly battle in the north?

56
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,810
How have you been, your highness?

57
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,410
Can't be better
all thanks to you!

58
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,410
The youngest born of my stepmother
became the crown prince.

59
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,780
Yes, l know.

60
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,490
Are you here because of that?

61
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,220
l don't understand...

62
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,220
l am asking you're here
since you're worried

63
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,030
if l, Lee Bang-won is sad
not becoming a crown prince.

64
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,560
And l heard your father-in-law
did a great part in proclaiming him.

65
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,840
How could it be?

66
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,280
lt's it his majesty's decision
to crown a prince.

67
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,510
l sincerely envy your father-in-law.

68
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,510
He shouldn't have any worry

69
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,080
as he has a strong man like you
right next to him.

70
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,320
Anyway, let's talk more

71
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,350
at the feast later.

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,020
l get going.

73
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,380
Thief! Catch him!

74
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,280
Ouch!

75
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,320
Please don't!

76
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,590
Are you trying to cripple a child
for stealing an ornament?

77
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,390
He's just a starving child.

78
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,430
For you, this is only the means
to feed yourself for a few days.

79
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,740
But this is the only gift from my mother
who l cannot meet anymore.

80
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,710
So please take this
and buy the food with it.

81
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,770
And do not try to
do the things like this again.

82
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,110
Do you understand?

83
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,450
Everyone has a precious thing
that cannot be taken away.

84
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,100
l made a gaffe, lord.

85
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,730
Please forgive my disrespect.

86
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,480
Let's go.

87
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,140
You met Prince Jung-an.

88
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
Yes.

89
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,820
He pretends to be a toothless tiger

90
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,360
but he cannot cheat me.

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,430
He's just hiding his claws,
l can see that.

92
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
You also know his character.

93
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,610
lt'd be a huge mistake

94
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,270
if you only see him
as a friend like before.

95
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,810
You understand?

96
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,850
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,260
You will be assigned to be
the commander of the great army

98
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,090
so you'd better get prepared.

99
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,980
But sir...

100
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,290
haven't l made myself clear
that l want to retire after this battle?

101
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,160
But the state of affairs
doesn't allow you that luxury.

102
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,500
The youngest son of second queen
became the crown prince.

103
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
The reform of military system
offended the other princes a lot, too.

104
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,340
We need to use the outside enemy
to ease the within complaints.

105
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,810
We should attack the east
of Liaohe River.

106
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,180
All you have to to is
to follow the order.

107
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,860
Did you get well?

108
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,130
Thanks to herbal medicine
you sent, l got much better now.

109
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,460
PRINCESS KYUNG-SOON
DAUGHTER OF KING TAEJO
Thanks to herbal medicine
you sent, l got much better now.

110
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,760
Good to hear.

111
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,630
Get well soon and you should
give a birth to this family's heir.

112
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,200
Please don't, Father.

113
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,940
l'm here myself

114
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,400
as l wanted to give something
to my son-in-law.

115
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,910
KIM JIN
SON OF KIM MIN-JAE
- Bring it in.
- Yes, your majesty.

116
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,150
You shall open it.

117
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,060
lsn't this?

118
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,860
Do you remember it,
Lord Sambong?

119
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,470
lt's a scent bag.

120
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,670
lt's too precious
to give to my grandson.

121
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,380
This is what a father-in-law
gives to his son-in-law by tradition,

122
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,640
so you should carry it with you
all the time.

123
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,150
lnscrutable are
the king's favor, your majesty.

124
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,720
And that scent bag is
also the expression

125
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,760
to urge the son-in-law
to produce an heir...

126
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,230
You get it?

127
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,670
You shouldn't be here.

128
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,140
One must not be late
for the celebration for him.

129
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,740
You'd better get going.

130
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,090
- l should leave first.
- Sure.

131
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,280
Let me propose a toast.

132
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,360
This drink might help you
be more productive tonight.

133
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,840
Oh, is that so?

134
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes, my lord.

135
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,090
Oh, you're finally here!

136
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,120
How come the hero of the night

137
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,610
be so late?

138
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,160
My apologies, your highness.
There were some family affairs...

139
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,390
The powerful family surely
has lots of affairs to handle...

140
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,690
Lord Sambong can't make it.

141
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,440
Well well...

142
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,270
Like father-in-law,

143
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,400
like son-in-law.

144
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,600
How come can they be

145
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,610
not occupied when they

146
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,650
desperately try to steal
all others' thunders?

147
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,070
Haven't l told you?

148
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,350
Your lordship should've
trained yourself better

149
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,010
to be able to move quickly!

150
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,580
Don't you think?

151
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,320
Drink!

152
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,840
This is Gahee.

153
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,440
And she prepared the dance
which is in trend in Ming Dynasty

154
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,950
only for tonight's feast.

155
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,110
Dance has its own artistry and manners.

156
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,550
Your lordship should be
aware of such things.

157
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,190
How dare you humble thing!

158
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,190
Tonight will be your last day on earth!

159
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,050
Please forgive her.

160
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,030
She even hasn't turned up
her hair yet.

161
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,330
So please have a mercy.

162
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,630
What?
She's still a virgin?

163
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,700
Good then!

164
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,270
Then l'll be her man.

165
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,980
l'd rather die right here

166
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,020
than to let it be so.

167
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,880
Rather die?

168
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,990
l'll teach you manners tonight!

169
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,900
Please stop.

170
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,670
You think l'm your subordinate

171
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,650
as you distinguished yourself at war
and found favor with his majesty?

172
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,590
Please stop.

173
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,150
l see.
You want to be her man too?

174
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,360
Good, then.

175
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,820
Then let our swords find

176
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,470
who should be her man.
Draw your sword!

177
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,380
lt is true that l'm the least
favorite son of his majesty

178
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,480
but how could you
make this scene

179
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,350
in front of a royal prince?

180
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,250
Your highness.

181
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,550
How about having her decide
who should be her man?

182
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,590
lt could be an idea!

183
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,460
l am here to celebrate

184
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,070
but is ignored by others
because of that girl

185
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,270
and now l might have to
see the blood! No way!

186
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,370
Either of your lordships
must accept the girl's choice!

187
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,340
l think it shows your heart!

188
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,240
Let's shout outloud

189
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,980
altogether

190
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,420
to celebrate those two?

191
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,350
Hurray!

192
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,090
Hurray!

193
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,240
Why did you do that?

194
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,140
Because you were bleeding.

195
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,510
Well... at least
an awkward situation is over now,

196
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,080
you take a rest.

197
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,130
l'll be in a trouble
if you leave me like this.

198
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,960
What do you mean?

199
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,060
Even here at courtesans' house,

200
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,760
the girl who gets deserted
on the first night

201
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,270
is said to be unlucky
and no man comes for her.

202
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,030
LEE JE
SENIOR ADJUTANT TO KIM MIN-JAE

203
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,810
Stop.

204
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,020
lt would be enough to show
that you are not deserted.

205
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,360
l've heard that
you are tough and violent.

206
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,830
But it seems to be wrong.

207
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,540
People say that you kill mercilessly.

208
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,740
As if having a piece of cake.

209
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,000
l just follow the king's order.

210
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,440
How can a man be merciless
in taking others' lives?

211
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,920
Stop the nonsense.

212
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,280
Take some rest.

213
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,770
Mom! Mom!

214
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,410
Do you want to do the real revenge?

215
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,080
You really mean to
give me that ornament

216
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,640
- if l take out the kitten?
- Sure.

217
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,700
My hand is too big...

218
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,920
You will hear the meow.

219
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,720
You go in.
l'll wait outside.

220
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,980
Shush!

221
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,310
Don't move!

222
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,860
- You humble thing!
- Please help!

223
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,890
How dare you?

224
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,980
Look at him.

225
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,580
The girl he raped the other time
turned to be a civilian girl.

226
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,340
And she reported to
the district office.

227
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,320
You should've been careful to allure
only the lowest class girls!

228
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,450
How could we recognize them
only by seeing?

229
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,990
We thought she was a slave
as she dressed like one.

230
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,930
Damn it.

231
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,170
Our fathers founded this kingdom
and we just want to find their account,

232
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,740
why is it so complicated?

233
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,170
Anyway it happened so...

234
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,400
let's drop it
and go back to red-light district.

235
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,400
lt's just fine with us

236
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,470
but what should king's son-in-law do
when his majesty has

237
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,690
- all his eyes on him?
- Damn it.

238
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,360
l never wanted
to be king's son-in-law.

239
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,620
What can you do?

240
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,130
lt's your destiny
to have such powerful

241
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,760
grand father and father.

242
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,100
Speaking of which...

243
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,600
- have you heard the rumor?
- What rumour?

244
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,940
The rumor has widely spread that

245
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,540
his father stole
a courtesan's cherry last night.

246
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,280
Are you serious?
l knew it.

247
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,880
He pretends to be serious
and show dignity...

248
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,860
But inside,
he is all the same as other men!

249
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,200
You know how l founded this country.

250
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,100
Yes, your majesty.

251
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,310
Your majesty.

252
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,480
l now present you this sword

253
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,820
because l want you

254
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,260
to be my another self
closer than the blood-ties.

255
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,430
l need you
more than anybody else

256
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,330
for me and my crown prince.

257
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,960
So now l close down

258
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,040
the old military system
from the previous dynasty

259
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,640
and have it restructured as
one great army

260
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,370
controlling three services.

261
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,470
Hold this sword for me
by my side.

262
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,080
And protect the crown price with it.

263
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,820
This is my first request
and royal command.

264
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,920
And l now name Kim Min-jae,
commander of the right army

265
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,990
as the supreme commander
of the new great army.

266
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,890
l shall obey the command,
your majesty.

267
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
How could he do this to me?

268
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,080
lt's a serious demotion now that
his majesty appointed me

269
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,280
as the Minister of
Culture and Education

270
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,980
when l spent all my life
in the battle field!

271
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,380
Great. Good.

272
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,430
This country would be
put under the control of

273
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,550
Lord Sambong and
Commander Kim Min-jae!

274
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,260
That is not quite right.

275
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,200
Kim Min-jae is...

276
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,360
only Lord Sambong's dog.

277
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,240
What l would like to tell you is...

278
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,780
here's no one who has given
bigger contributions in

279
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,870
founding this kingdom
than your highness.

280
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,780
But it makes me so upset
to see others but yourself

281
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,250
control the important state affairs.

282
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,680
That's right.
You need to read the moves.

283
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,760
- Just like that!
- My lord!

284
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:22,130
l like being like this.
l mean it.

285
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,760
But your highness...

286
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,840
l need to get her service tonight
no matter what.

287
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,700
Let her in whenever she's ready.

288
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,580
But she serves one man

289
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,240
- and only sells her artistry.
- Hey!

290
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,110
l told you to bring her in.
No matter what.

291
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,660
Understood.

292
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,890
Sir.

293
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,590
Look there!

294
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,190
What are you doing?
Come down quick!

295
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,360
There is the least of custom
that even a low life should follow,

296
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,070
there is a heart to keep
even for a courtesan like me.

297
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,470
lf you keep insisting on my service,

298
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,510
l'd ratherjump out of here.

299
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,580
Who would care or call you

300
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,380
a virtuous woman
even if you die like this?

301
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,060
You'll be remembered as

302
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,920
a mad girl who killed
herself for nothing.

303
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,990
l'd rather like to be remembered
as a mad girl killing herself

304
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,590
than to sell my smiles

305
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,770
in the arms of men like you!

306
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,860
What?

307
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,100
Gahee!

308
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,840
Why are you doing this?

309
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,510
Please don't.

310
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,050
You can't do that.

311
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,620
Please!

312
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,780
My lord!

313
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,090
Please don't, sir!

314
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,180
Sir!

315
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,190
Who would gurantee

316
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,060
if things like this
wouldn't happen again?

317
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,560
She rejected any request

318
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,000
from any man

319
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,870
carrying this hankerchief
in her bosom

320
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,270
since she became your woman.

321
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,970
l will let her leave here

322
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,810
as soon as she recovers.

323
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,850
What's your plan?

324
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,420
You are not planning
to take her under your custidy.

325
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,460
She is also one of those girls

326
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,460
who can survive

327
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,630
when the bees come for the flowers.

328
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,800
So the scentless flowers'
don't belong here.

329
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,700
l just can tell her
to go her own way.

330
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,520
LADYJUNG
WIFE OF KIM MIN-JAE

331
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,900
Are you that pure and innocent
to trust a man?

332
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,360
How dare you, lowly thing tried to
drag the Lord down?

333
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,670
l guess what you needed is this.

334
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,610
Leave now and
do not ever come back

335
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,740
unless you want to hinder
the Lord's future.

336
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,260
I thought what wouId be
the way for you, Lord.

337
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,860
Your benefit on me
was way too big...

338
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,700
The messenger from Chuihyang-roo.

339
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,670
so I became fond of you.

340
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,040
But I am afraid that
I couId drag you down...

341
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,720
So I wouId Iike to Ieave
with my heart sent out in this Ietter,

342
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,980
PIease

343
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,880
be weII.

344
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,220
Lady Gahee!

345
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,860
Sir.

346
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,890
l was wondering about you...
You're as beautiful as l heard.

347
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,500
Your compliment is
above my deserts, your highness.

348
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,960
Make yourself at home
and be my friend.

349
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,840
l prepared a humble gift for you.

350
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,610
lt's 'Retired Life'
by Wei Ying-wu.

351
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,740
l made it myself
even though l'm not good

352
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,180
as l heard that
you are fond of poems...

353
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,350
lt's a bit embarassing to tell you

354
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,650
but l write myself.

355
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,330
What do you write?

356
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,890
lt's just the small stories
of our world.

357
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,560
Please take a look sometimes.

358
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,470
Yes, your highness.

359
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,600
His lordship,
King's son-in-law is here.

360
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,550
- Guess she is my father's...
- Yes, sir.

361
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,620
Let me greet you.
My name is Gahee.

362
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,470
What were you two talking?
You seemed really close.

363
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,870
Please take a look.

364
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,670
Noble and humble
are different species.

365
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,480
But out in our world
each has seperate noble deals.

366
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,530
Let me leave.

367
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,540
What do you think?
lsn't it great?

368
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,710
Yes, it is.

369
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,280
Very good, indeed.

370
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,900
You need to lower yourself
and keep the integrity!

371
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,630
How could you bring
the girl to your house?

372
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,700
Did you forget that
we're King's in-laws?

373
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,810
Such an imprudent behaviour
when you need to help

374
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,070
the Crown Prince conquer the north!

375
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,800
Did you forget what your life
would be if l did not take you?

376
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,820
No better than wildered animals'
living with barbarians.

377
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,990
l made you my son-in-law
even though l knew that

378
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,110
you are born by a babarian woman.

379
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:24,620
Do you think Jin could be
king's son-in-law

380
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,030
if l didn't take your offer?

381
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,870
Are you threatening me
to reveal Jin is not your real son?

382
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,510
Are you trying to humiliate me
using my daughter's flaw?

383
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,680
l would not have been on board
for all this in the first place

384
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,580
if l ever were to break
the promise l made you.

385
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,970
How could you be so rude
to sneak in?

386
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,600
Please leave.

387
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,610
l never imagined that

388
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,310
you would be my father's concubine.

389
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,310
l thought you were dead.

390
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,790
l almost died...
but survived.

391
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,950
To live and to die
makes no difference

392
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,660
to a low life like me.

393
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,140
Why did you disappear
so suddenly then?

394
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,230
Do you know...

395
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,150
how desperately l was
to look for you?

396
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,880
Did you look for me?

397
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,140
Sure.

398
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,250
l'm so happy
to have you nearby.

399
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,290
Even though as a concubine,

400
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,790
but l am your father's woman now.

401
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,960
Do you intend to commit immorality?

402
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,530
Please leave.

403
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,200
Lady, her highness
wishes to see you.

404
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,490
Are you done reading?

405
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,520
How was it?

406
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,860
lnteresting.

407
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,970
The story of the lord in exile
and the courteasan loving him...

408
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,940
lt is sad yet beautiful
at the same time.

409
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,800
Good to hear.

410
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,900
Anything else you want to add?

411
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,810
- The writing reminded me...
- Are you inside?

412
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,510
l'm sorry.

413
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,850
l hope l didn't interrupt
your pleasant conversation.

414
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,480
Not at all.
Please come in.

415
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,030
Please continue.

416
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,530
When l was at courtesans' house,

417
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,870
l heard a similar story like yours
from a silk peddler.

418
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,870
- You did?
- Yes.

419
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,440
But that story was
different from yours...

420
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,210
How different?
Tell me.

421
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,610
When the noble man
returns home after recindment,

422
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,550
he hurts the courtesan
and leaves alone

423
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,090
as he is afraid if she becomes
an obstacle for his success.

424
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,660
Poor thing.

425
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,420
ls that the end?
Just like that?

426
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,120
But that courtesan survives

427
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,360
and pays a noble man a revenge.

428
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,970
Really? How?

429
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,230
Well...

430
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,540
l haven't heard that part yet.

431
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,680
He promised to tell me
when he comes next time.

432
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,310
lt's just a passing time story
but it tears my heart.

433
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,440
lt can't be true.

434
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,250
- A man can't be that evil.
- You're right.

435
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,480
lt would be the made-up story.

436
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,520
But be sure to tell me the ending

437
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,350
when you hear from
the peddler next time.

438
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,290
l will, madame.

439
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,890
The dead girl comes back to life.

440
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,730
- Are you kidding?
- Wait!

441
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,230
So you'r saying

442
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,100
the girl you killed
to tie her tongues

443
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,870
comes back in your life
as your father's concubine.

444
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,550
l felt anxious when
you were obsessed with that girl.

445
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,640
lt was not really like you.

446
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,690
Damn it!

447
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,650
lt was my fault to be
blinded by her beauty.

448
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,730
l would be deadly intimidated
if l were you now.

449
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,800
Shouldn't you inform
your mother about this?

450
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,300
No, no.

451
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,740
l'll tie her tongue for sure.

452
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,080
Don't come out!
lt is dangerous!

453
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,550
Who ordered you to do this?

454
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,460
- Sir!
- Lady!

455
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,760
Gahee!

456
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:44,860
Gahee!

457
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,340
- Bring the doctor!
- Yes, sir.

458
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,470
Lady!

459
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,340
Lady.

460
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,690
Assassins at the princess' residence!

461
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,750
Who could dare to send the assassins
to the prime commander's?

462
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,670
We should be eradicate who did this

463
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,030
and made them to pay for their sins.

464
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,510
But at the same time,
we can't ignore the fact that

465
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,530
the servants of the prime commander
possessed the swords for fight

466
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,740
when their master leads to abolish
the private armies of the noble.

467
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,920
Are you calling the servants
who grabbed the swords

468
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,010
to protect their master
private soldiers?

469
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,110
We need to reveal
who threatened the lives of

470
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,660
princess, king's son-in-law and
prime commander, your majesty.

471
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,720
Who should we investigate and blame

472
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,820
as all the assassins are dead?

473
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,300
And servants with swords
can't be nothing but private soldiers.

474
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,470
lt would be the right thing
to do for the prime commander

475
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,140
to show initiative to vest
his servants to great army.

476
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,640
l have but myself to blame for this.

477
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,510
l'll send all the servants
related to this accident to great army

478
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,480
so that it doesn't
become an issue any more.

479
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,220
l will forbid

480
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,320
further discussion on this matter.

481
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,020
l'll strictly reprimmend anyone
who mentions this again.

482
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,090
Beware!

483
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,890
lsn't this his lordship,
the prime commander?

484
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,830
What brought
your precious presence here?

485
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,130
l came to hunt together
as it's been a while.

486
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,070
l'll be more than happy!
You're always welcomed.

487
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,110
Let it begin!

488
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,670
Your skills didn't rust at all.

489
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,440
l was just lucky

490
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,080
as everyone here
is very fast and good.

491
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,550
Of course they are
as fast as wild animals

492
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,010
since they do nothing
but hunting everyday.

493
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:27,850
Was it you

494
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,750
to have sent me
the guests, your highness?

495
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,620
l'm so sorry to hear
you think me that way.

496
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,230
How could you train
and extend private soliders like this?

497
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,670
You know...

498
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,160
l'm just amusing myself

499
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,970
by hunting animals
with these playboys.

500
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,660
Then please send them
to great army.

501
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,180
Why are you trying to go through

502
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,010
the large scale military training
at the timing like this?

503
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:59,450
To unite all the military power
of the nation as one army.

504
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,290
Are you trying to attack
the east of Liaohe River,

505
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:08,830
or aiming the throne
using the young crown prince?

506
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,400
You're going too far.

507
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,530
Well...

508
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,470
you might not understand

509
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,200
the real reason for this training.

510
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,700
As you are just
a henchman of Lord Sambong.

511
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,110
Private soldiers are
dividing the nation's power...

512
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,480
Min-jae.

513
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,280
Look, Lord Kim Min-jae.

514
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,520
l want to hear your thoughts,
not the ones of Lord Sambong.

515
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,360
ls this man sitting in front of me

516
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,460
Kim Min-jae

517
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,860
or Lord Sambong, Jung Do-jeon?

518
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:52,130
Are you satisfied with playing
Lord Sambong's right hand man?

519
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:55,040
l don't belong to anyone.

520
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,780
l just serve the king

521
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,170
and protect the people
with my sword.

522
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,840
l wish it would be
what you really mean.

523
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,380
Are you that happy?

524
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,760
Yes, l am, sir.

525
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,090
Didn't expect other lords
would assist me that much.

526
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,540
Lord Ha said...

527
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,230
Yes?

528
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,540
How we could
investigate the dead

529
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,780
and who we could blame?

530
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,940
But can you tell me...

531
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,410
who would get rid of

532
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,690
the dog's bowl
when the dog dies?

533
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,990
Of course the owner should...

534
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,830
Do you really think
it would be that simple

535
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,560
to get it done
by killing a fierce dog

536
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,390
using some mutts, my lord?

537
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,750
lf they killed that girl then

538
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,310
do you think you can sit there

539
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,110
and have the drink

540
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,650
with me now?

541
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,230
lt's quite amusing that
your lordship's security is at stake

542
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,320
upon this mad girl's life.

543
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,300
You know inscrutable
are the ways of Heaven.

544
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,030
This incident would

545
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,080
make things easier for us.

546
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,250
You know who
Kim Min-jae's mother was?

547
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,350
She was a Jurchen geisha.

548
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,650
A man naturally longs for
his mother's love.

549
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:56,120
Sir, there seems to be
a rat poking its nose.

550
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,030
l know.

551
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,080
Your highness surely takes after
his majesty, a god of archery!

552
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:27,360
l think it's the time
for peony to bloom.

553
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,210
Lady, the message arrived

554
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:45,150
saying the silk peddler
came at a linen shop.

555
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,580
- Wait here.
- Yes, ma'am.

556
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,130
Are you there?

557
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,230
Anyone here?

558
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,250
What brought you here?

559
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,930
We should finish the talk

560
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,770
we couldn't finish last time.

561
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,320
Do you mean a talk

562
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,010
like this?

563
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,880
Yes.

564
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,050
Now we are talking.

565
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,160
You know you're beheaded

566
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:13,630
if you commit the moral sin.

567
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,030
Of course.

568
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:17,970
The one who committed

569
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,340
and the counter-part,
both get beheaded.

570
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,510
That's why

571
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,370
we should tune together

572
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,880
so that we can live together.

573
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,900
There's no way out
for you like before.

574
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,670
No one would come in.

575
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,100
Forget the peddler.

576
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,740
lt's the false message
l made up to bring you out.

577
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:06,480
Peddler? What peddler?

578
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,650
Did you really believe that?

579
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,630
What the heck...

580
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:19,290
l just made it up

581
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,730
to entertain the poor princess.

582
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,170
We need an excuse

583
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,910
to have fun, don't you think?

584
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,080
Yes, you're right.
Absolutely right.

585
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:38,180
But before you take
what you want

586
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,850
you need to give me
something in return.

587
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,250
l will give you...

588
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,690
whatever you say.

589
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,170
Give me this
as a token of your affection.

590
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,600
But that is...

591
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,810
given by his majesty, the King.

592
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,080
lt's the token to show
that we risk our lives.

593
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:14,020
lt has to be as precious as this.

594
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,120
Right...

595
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,490
Whatever you say.

596
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,080
Oh, my...

597
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,340
What are you doing?

598
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,380
l'm sorry, sir.

599
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,150
lt is my fault...

600
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,290
Did you laugh?

601
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,560
Pardon?

602
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,890
No, your grace.

603
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:34,200
You laughed at me?

604
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:37,790
Laugh?

605
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,740
How dare you?

606
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,330
What are you doing?

607
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,750
This bastard...

608
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,990
he put the dirt on my shoe
but laughed.

609
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,890
lt is my fault, sir.

610
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,090
You heard him?
lt is his fault.

611
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,200
This old man took care of you
like your arms and legs

612
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,190
since you were born.

613
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:04,660
Follow me.

614
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,600
Fa... father.

615
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,140
Come to the next market.

616
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,850
Uncle! Look at this.

617
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:24,090
l got these at dawn

618
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,610
and it's still fresh!
What do you think?

619
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,030
Get up.

620
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:51,880
And try to block me.

621
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,390
l told you to get up!
Now!

622
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:06,130
Father, it's all my fault!

623
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,130
Madame, please move aside.
lt's father disciplining his own son.

624
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:11,270
Please reprimand me
for my lack of virtue

625
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,860
not to serve my husband properly.

626
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,760
lt's not your business to interrupt.

627
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,800
What is this fuss all about?

628
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,370
Sir.

629
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,740
He is the king's son-in-law
before he is your son.

630
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,420
lt's really embarrassing to do this
in front of all the servants!

631
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,950
Your overprotection causes him
to walk over the servants

632
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,660
and to get along with vulgar people

633
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,820
even when he cannot properly
draw the sword!

634
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,590
What should l do when you made
a king's son-in-law

635
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,120
that l never wanted to be?

636
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,530
My lord!

637
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,140
You treat him like this
as he is not your real son?

638
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,170
Do you really think that way?

639
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,580
lf not,

640
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:02,910
there is no reason for you
to get rage like this.

641
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:07,110
l have never seen Jin that way.

642
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,090
The problem lies in you
if you think the matter that way.

643
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,690
l didn't say anything to you
as l have conscience at least.

644
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:15,500
But it is quite hilarious
to hear it from you

645
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,660
who is hendpecked by concubine.

646
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,600
l can take everything

647
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,400
but l will not endure
if you treat my son bad.

648
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,730
l hope you have not forgotten

649
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,080
who made you come this far.

650
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:36,740
Can l ask...

651
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,820
for whom you and your father did it?

652
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,770
lt's Gahee, your highness.

653
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,870
May l come in?

654
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,170
Please come.

655
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,850
l was worried about you.

656
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,650
Don'tjust suffer patiently.
Pleaes say whatever you have inside.

657
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:24,120
No, l don't deserve it.

658
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,370
l hope you can forget about today too.

659
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,340
Yes, l will.

660
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,210
But since you are here,

661
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,540
we shall chat all night.

662
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,740
- Have you met the peddler?
- Yes.

663
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,420
l heard the ending.

664
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,950
So what happened to that geisha?

665
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,500
The nobIe man's mother
heard that story

666
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,290
and incited...

667
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,130
Please let me in!

668
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,800
But the poor girI's mother
who tried to appeaI the injustice

669
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,530
got hurt instead.

670
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,070
Mother!

671
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,870
Mo... mother!

672
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,480
The bearer mistook

673
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,050
her mother

674
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,380
as the courteasan.

675
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:44,440
How could it happen?

676
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,880
Maybe it was Heaven's will.

677
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,640
Her mother died for her.

678
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,420
How would your highness

679
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:58,520
end the story if it were yours?

680
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,820
Well...

681
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,760
l cannot think of any

682
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,520
as it is too sad and heartbreaking.

683
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,740
Failed again.

684
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,540
l really want to be good
at archery like you, my brothers!

685
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,320
You would get better soon

686
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,680
if you take after his majesty.

687
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,120
Here comes his majesty, the King.

688
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,520
Father the king!

689
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,000
l told you not to come to the palace
if not ordered!

690
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,540
What is the reason?

691
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:53,710
You made me get
blood of thousands on my hand.

692
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,210
But as it is over,
you don't need a son

693
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,640
who has blood on his hands?

694
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,880
How dare you!

695
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,190
Please stop anger, your majesty.

696
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,930
You frightened

697
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,670
our precious crown prince.

698
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,840
Listen Min-jae.

699
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,780
Lord Kim Min-jae.

700
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,990
Are you satisfied with playing
Lord Sambong's right hand man?

701
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:42,690
l hope you have not forgotten
who made you come this far.

702
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,750
You look pensive.

703
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,970
What is bothering you?

704
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,180
No.

705
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:11,480
l was just looking back the past days.

706
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:13,960
By the way,

707
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,560
it's been quite a while
since you moved in with me,

708
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,130
did you inform
your mother about this?

709
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,330
Well...

710
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,460
lf you lost the contact,

711
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,670
l can find her for you.

712
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,980
lt would not take long
if l send out a few people.

713
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,080
You cannot find her.

714
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,760
Did you spread her ashes in that river?

715
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,950
Yes.

716
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,700
Lord, please don't...

717
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,850
You should have told me!

718
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:23,030
l couldn't

719
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,360
as it broke my heart.

720
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,930
l am deeply sorry.

721
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,830
No.

722
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:39,800
l promise now...
l'll protect you.

723
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,720
Against any threat.

724
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,720
l'll definitely keep you safe.

725
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,780
- Madame.
- Stop.

726
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,590
What are you doing?
Burn everything!

727
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,090
Lady.

728
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,660
Please calm down, sir.

729
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:34,560
You can hurt herself, my lord!

730
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,160
l'm sorry.

731
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:09,590
But thank god
it's just burnt on the edge.

732
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:15,070
l'm sorry for your mother.

733
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:28,150
Why did you do that?

734
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,780
lt's your mother's relics!

735
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:33,420
What should l do for you

736
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,720
if you do this to me?

737
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:45,730
lt is already enough
that l can do things to you.

738
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,940
l'm sorry that

739
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,080
l can't give you more.

740
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,020
l had a dream.

741
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,550
What kind of dream?

742
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:15,790
People gathered and
danced together.

743
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:20,630
And the place seemd to be
where you don't have to hurt others

744
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:23,230
or draw your sword
aiming against others.

745
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:30,140
Everyone was very happy
together as one, all equally.

746
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:37,240
And you and l were there

747
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:40,550
hand in hand
smiling at each other.

748
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:49,530
And l felt the warmth
of your hand.

749
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,760
lt surely is the good dream.

750
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,770
Gahee...

751
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,510
l can feel your grief.

752
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,610
l just want to live with you

753
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,320
just like in the dream l had.

754
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,890
l won't let go of this hand

755
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:32,400
no matter what.

756
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:38,970
Can you promise the same?

757
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,640
Yes, my lord.

758
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:10,340
lt's been a while that
we sit down together.

759
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,740
Yes, indeed.

760
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,650
So what made you

761
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:20,590
come to visit this old man?

762
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,520
l asked a question
to prime commander

763
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,790
when he visited me once
but couldn't hear the answer.

764
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:30,160
So today l am here
to hear it from you.

765
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,070
What is the real reason
for the formation training?

766
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:38,900
To build the great Joseon Dynasty

767
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:42,370
attacking the east of Liaohe River.

768
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:45,410
l think l heard this story before.

769
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:46,940
What do you mean?

770
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,450
The story of a troop
who left for Liaohe River

771
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:51,590
but returned for the surprise
attack in capital.

772
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:53,820
You went too far.

773
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:58,280
Do you mean that
l have some other goal in my mind?

774
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,690
No.

775
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:08,970
This way or that way we go,
does it make difference

776
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:12,670
if we could live happily
for years to come?

777
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:16,540
You know what happened last time
when l recited this poem to someone?

778
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:23,850
There are groups of people
who build up the private soldiers

779
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:26,080
using hunting and playing polo
as excuses.

780
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:28,320
But l think it would be right

781
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,220
to punish them severly

782
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:32,860
and to take in the slack the army

783
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,960
so that we can put right
from the root of the country.

784
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,560
lf we forbid hunting and polo
for military appropriation,

785
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,160
it could demoralize
the meritorious retainers

786
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:43,890
and turn them into enemies.

787
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,170
Do you mean that
you can do whatever you want

788
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,640
as you contributed to build
the new country?

789
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:53,650
l declare to forbid
hunting and polo as of today.

790
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,810
Confiscate weapons and horses
used for them.

791
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:03,550
l'm here to deliver his majesty's order.

792
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,960
He ordered all the horsese
except the minimum number

793
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,390
you need for the transportation
to belong to the great army

794
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:11,500
and also declared to forbid
hunting and polo.

795
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,870
What did you just say?

796
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,900
Forbid what?

797
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,510
Hunting and polo.

798
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,610
Forbiding hunting and polo.

799
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:28,580
What made his majesty

800
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:31,750
become so weak like this?

801
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:42,980
Can l decide
which horse to keep?

802
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,490
Yes, sir.

803
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,730
Thank you.

804
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,380
Look, Min-jae.

805
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:20,860
l only have that horse left

806
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:23,860
so there's no horse to give out.

807
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,420
What should l do?

808
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,480
Don't think Prince Jung-an easy.

809
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:43,110
We can't stop him this way.

810
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:47,090
He might hit us back.

811
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,650
Then it would put us in danger!

812
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,850
We didn't found this dynasty
to be killed by him!

813
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,950
l think it's the time.

814
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,700
Before we attack
the east of Liaohe River

815
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:05,160
we should hit
Prince Jung-an first.

816
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:09,640
But when?
lt's crucial.

817
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:15,310
Day of a white monkey.

818
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,320
Day of a white monkey.

819
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,790
As everyone will be enjoying
the feast all night

820
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:24,180
we can attack them
taking advantages of confusion.

821
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,020
They must know it too
and would not miss the day

822
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,600
to mobilize their army.

823
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,030
We can finish everything by afternoon

824
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,610
when his majesty wakes up.

825
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,770
Do you think we can succeed?

826
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,040
lt's totally up to
the prime commander.

827
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,250
HoId this sword for me
by my side.

828
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,570
And protect the crown prince
with it.

829
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:08,500
This is my first request
and royaI command.

830
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,790
Don't forget who made the wiId animaI
into a human being Iike today.

831
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,300
You shaII risk your Iife
for me and the king.

832
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:22,980
This is the scent bag that his majesty
gave to his son-in-law.

833
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,990
Time has almost come

834
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:45,270
for what you and l
worked together for.

835
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,130
l'll send you the message
in advance.

836
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,330
When you're plan is accomplished,

837
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,580
not that Kim's clan will fall

838
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:55,410
but the entire army of country
will also be paralyzed.

839
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,350
Then...

840
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,520
what would happen
to the prime commander?

841
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:08,320
What... do you think?

842
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,490
l shall leave

843
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,450
as it is already quite late.

844
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,810
She is the girl
l told you about.

845
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:30,440
Treat this as your mother
and your duty from now on.

846
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,410
Do not ever forget

847
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:35,950
how your mother died.

848
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,110
lt is peony.
Take this in your mind.

849
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,550
But thank god
it's just burnt on the edge.

850
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,890
Prince Jung-an shall attack
with his private soldiers.

851
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,990
He would aim the east gate.

852
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:24,530
Allocate the force outside the city
inside the palace.

853
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:27,060
- You should be fully prepared.
- Here it is, commander.

854
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,540
I wouId Iike to meet you discretIy
on a white monkey day.

855
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,640
l knew it.
She's no different than others.

856
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,760
ls it the medicine for the pirncess?

857
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:54,560
Yes, sir.

858
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,590
l see, give me that.

859
01:21:58,270 --> 01:21:59,790
l'll carry it myself.

860
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,570
lt would be difficult for me
to attend the feast

861
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,870
as l feel suddenly dizzy.

862
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:10,000
Don't worry.
l'll explain to the king well

863
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:12,440
so that he doesn't
have to be worried.

864
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,620
Your highness, Kim Min-jae
is said to start to move.

865
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:24,620
- How long did l sleep?
- A bit less than 2 hours.

866
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,960
Even Heaven shall not know

867
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:34,790
what you would do today.

868
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,750
Let me pay the respect to
your majesty and your highness.

869
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,420
Where is princess?

870
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,860
She could not come as she is a bit ill
so sent her regards to you.

871
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,160
Gosh, is she ill?

872
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,960
Not in a serious condition.

873
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,930
She seemed to feel dizzy
as she is a bit feeble.

874
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,400
lf sister is ill,

875
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,200
please send her the herbal medicine,
your majesty.

876
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,940
Yes...

877
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,170
Due to that...

878
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:24,520
l would like to return to attend her.
Please allow, your majesty.

879
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,880
Of course, l will.

880
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:29,410
He's such a sweet husband.

881
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,590
Any message from peony?

882
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,070
We sent the soldiers
to the apppointed place.

883
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:56,150
- ls everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

884
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:57,780
Everyhing is perfectly prepared.

885
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,260
l'll forgive
what you did last time.

886
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,290
However...

887
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,360
we should make it sure today.

888
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:19,400
l can't stand being lost to anyone.

889
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:25,750
Once you receive the token of my affection,
you should give me something in return.

890
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,380
l changed my mind

891
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:43,330
that your father shall do better
than you who cannot behave

892
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:45,220
like a person should.

893
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:46,820
Cannot behave?

894
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,930
Are you crazy?

895
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,430
Repeat that again.

896
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:59,870
Repeat with your filthy mouth!

897
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,250
This filthy mouth.
l shall reap this...

898
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:58,630
Attack!

899
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,330
What is the fuss?

900
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:29,440
Go and find out now!

901
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:02,360
Your majesty, your highness,

902
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:03,630
you should shelter yourselves.

903
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:09,240
What are you looking at?
Go and guard the king!

904
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,700
Stop right now!

905
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,710
Your majesty,
they plotted treason against you.

906
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:17,080
No, they cannot be.

907
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:20,780
lt should be Prince Jung-an
who set up the soldiers!

908
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,050
Lord Sambong!

909
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,890
How dare you lie
in front of the king?

910
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,250
Bang-won, how dare you?

911
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,620
Your majesty, Kim Min-jae assigned
the soldiers at the east gate

912
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:33,800
plotting the treason against you!

913
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,430
lt's slander, your majesty!

914
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,840
lf he is not plotting the treason,

915
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,670
how come the soldiers
to guard outside the capital

916
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:42,070
are all inside the palace?

917
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:48,580
Lord Sambong and Kim Min-jae
plotted treason to kill me and other lords

918
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:51,850
who found out about their relative,
and king's son-in-law, Kim Jin's adultery

919
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,750
and to cover it before
your majesty finds out about it.

920
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:57,150
What do you talk about?

921
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:01,050
Who having an affair with whom?

922
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,360
How could l believe you

923
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,860
telling me my son-in-law
committed the moral sin?

924
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:09,370
Your majesty,

925
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:12,740
l have an evidence that
they cannot deny.

926
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,660
Let them in!

927
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:32,820
Here are the sinners!

928
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,560
My princess!

929
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,270
Father!

930
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,450
l declare the end of the feast.

931
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:07,350
Emprison the sinners

932
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:09,190
and others...

933
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,490
return home!

934
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,630
How could this trouble happen?

935
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,070
Whose letter is it?

936
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:04,040
Lady Gahee told me

937
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,810
to give this to your highness
after 9 PM.

938
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,820
You wouId be abIe to
see the end of the taIe

939
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,950
if you come to the storage now.

940
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:30,300
Madame!

941
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:31,770
Get off!

942
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,070
l shall listen to what she has to say.

943
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,740
Madame, it is just...

944
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,110
that bitch allured me...

945
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,620
But her face doesn't look like

946
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,460
that of a seducer.

947
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:47,820
So tell me,

948
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:51,530
why did you make me find out?

949
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:53,190
Can your highness

950
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:57,170
forgive the husband
who cheated you

951
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,530
and stay with him all your life?

952
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:02,470
How dare you?

953
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:06,170
l can put you in death
if l talk to his majesty, the king.

954
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,280
l did not long for the life
from the beginning.

955
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,720
But l didn't want to harm Lord Kim

956
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:16,880
and came up with the only solution
for the humble thing like me.

957
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,350
Please understand this.

958
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:25,160
l do not care about me
but Lord Kim should... please.

959
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,430
Who are you all?

960
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:37,140
That's what l know.

961
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:41,950
Bang-won is not easy fella

962
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:46,340
so we should've not shown
any rustiness to him.

963
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:52,890
That is why
l believed in you and asked.

964
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:57,250
ls this your only answer

965
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:59,000
for my sincere heart?

966
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,520
Let me die for this.

967
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:02,360
l will spare your life

968
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,460
as princess requested.

969
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:08,230
But you will have to kill

970
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:10,470
the girl discretly within tonight.

971
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,810
Why are you silent?

972
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:22,810
Are you defying the royal command?

973
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:25,550
Are you trying to put
me and crwon prince in danger

974
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:28,450
to give them excuse
to overthrone us?

975
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,490
Shut her mouth by killing her.

976
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,000
lt is the royal command!

977
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,880
So it was all planned
in the beginning.

978
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:26,180
Using me to take revenge
for your mother?

979
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:28,720
Tell me.

980
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:33,480
Does it make any difference
if l tell you the truth?

981
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,320
You know it too well,

982
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,820
nothing can be taken back
even if l deny all this.

983
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:42,430
Do you really want me
to kill you?

984
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,670
l would not have started it at all
if l were afraid of the death.

985
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:48,870
lf there were sin for me,

986
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:51,210
it would be me born
as a humble girl

987
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:53,440
and survived.

988
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,710
How can it be a sin?

989
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:59,610
lt is sin for a low life like me.

990
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:03,120
Because l am not even
a human being.

991
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:07,880
This country values a cow
more than three low lives.

992
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:12,690
Nobody is punished for
raping and killing a humble girl.

993
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:18,300
But you need to die
if you rape your father's concubine.

994
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:23,040
You mean during all those time
that we shared together...

995
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:29,770
you never loved me?
Even for a moment?

996
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,950
l died when my mother died.

997
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:38,050
l cannot forgive king's son-in-law
even he pays for it with his life.

998
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:43,260
l would have done anything
to make him pay for his sin.

999
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,900
This is...

1000
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:50,230
All that l can say.

1001
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:01,840
No.

1002
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:06,310
lf so, it does not explain
why you informed the princess.

1003
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:08,310
You were to upset the plan

1004
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:13,520
as you were trying to save me!

1005
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:15,160
Just kill me.

1006
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:18,430
Only my death will give you life.

1007
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,520
Enough.

1008
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,500
Do not forgive me.

1009
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,340
l will never

1010
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,680
forgive you.

1011
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,110
So...

1012
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,750
you need to live.

1013
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,160
Your highness, please...

1014
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:06,010
l told everyone to return home!

1015
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:20,520
The girl and Kim Min-jae ran away,
your majesty.

1016
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,960
What should you do?

1017
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:28,130
With that Kim Min-jae
who committed high treason

1018
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:30,900
for running away
disobeying the royal command?

1019
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,270
From now on,

1020
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:52,590
l shall handle

1021
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:56,160
all the things related to this.

1022
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:17,840
So you are claiming your innocence?

1023
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:19,710
This is really unfair.

1024
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:25,390
l frightened her a bit to get back

1025
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,320
what that humble thing
stole from me.

1026
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:29,760
l see.

1027
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:36,300
l will believe in you
as you are my husband.

1028
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:41,000
l will explain to my father the King
and ask for his forgiveness.

1029
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:43,310
Thank you, madame.

1030
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,860
But since sometime back...

1031
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:04,080
you didn't smell the bag of scent.

1032
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:08,330
That is...

1033
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:10,030
And instead

1034
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,530
l could smell the same scent
from Gahee.

1035
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:21,340
But l couldn't talk about it
as it was a thing

1036
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,450
beyond humane imagination.

1037
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:31,210
But if you told me the truth
at leastjust now

1038
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,820
l should not have done this far.

1039
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,610
Put fire!

1040
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:55,440
Fire!

1041
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:30,510
Watch out!

1042
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:41,160
Please give me the chance
to get rid of him.

1043
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:00,340
Please get on the boat, sir.

1044
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,310
l won't go without you.

1045
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,310
l'll follow you if l survive.

1046
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,010
How could l go alone
leaving you behind?

1047
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:16,250
Do not worry.

1048
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,720
lt won't be long.

1049
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:24,970
So be sure to survive.

1050
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:32,030
No!

1051
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,750
My lord!

1052
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,420
Lord!

1053
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,720
My lord, please!

1054
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:48,590
Sir!

1055
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,330
My lord!

1056
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:00,300
No! My lord!

1057
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:36,570
Lord!

1058
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:41,060
My lord...

1059
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:42,360
Sir.

1060
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:44,210
Come here!

1061
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,200
Please hide!

1062
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:56,950
I promised to protect you.

1063
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:02,900
What should you do, sir...

1064
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,460
No matter what happens...

1065
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,530
I made a pIedge to you.

1066
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:08,630
My lord!

1067
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,880
No, my lord!

1068
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:08,020
My lord!

1069
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:24,530
No! My lord!

1070
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:33,070
I won't Iet go of this hand

1071
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,230
no matter what.

1072
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:43,280
- Can you promise the same, too?
- Yes, my Iord.

1073
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,790
I had a dream.

1074
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,230
What kind of dream?

1075

PeopIe gathered and
danced together.

1076
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:16,770
And the pIace seemed to be

1077
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:20,350
the pIace you don't have
to hurt others

1078
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:23,550
or draw your sword
aiming against others.

1079
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:30,320
Everyone was very happy
together as one, aII equaIIy.

1080
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,960
And you and I were there

1081
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,300
hand in hand
smiIing at each other.

1082
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:46,440
It sureIy is the good dream.

1083
01:47:49,210 --> 01:47:51,110
I wouId Iike to go there

1084
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:55,190
with you, my Iord.

1085
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,560

recover the corpse.
