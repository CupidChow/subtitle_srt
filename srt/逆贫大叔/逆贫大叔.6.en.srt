1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,718
It's out of love and respect
that everybody calls me

2
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,221
Samsik, Brother Samsik, Uncle Samsik.

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,931
And I just love it.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
Previously on Uncle Samsik

5
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,892
My nickname, I mean.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,521
Once that's in place,

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,024
I'll be an official member
of the Cheongwoo Federation.

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>You understand
what that means, right?</i>

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,278
<i>So I'll be the one
reigning over the nobility.</i>

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,407
Yes. We all will be eating pizza
like the Americans.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,950
Pizza,

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,869
I'm sure that none of you
have heard of it.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,496
Ah, it's extraordinary.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,458
<i>He is Manager Kim San
from the National Reconstruction Bureau.</i>

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,793
<i>Well, he studied economics in the US.</i>

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>He was also an Albright Scholar, Sir.</i>

17
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,132
Minister Choi.
The way forward for South Korea…

18
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,301
is laid out here.

19
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,511
You know Yoon Palbong
of the Dongdaemun gang?

20
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,679
I can give you his turf.

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,765
<i>Yoon Palbong is sending
25 of his guys</i>

22
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,516
<i>to the Innovation Party event</i>

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>so he can cause a scene
and ruin the speech.</i>

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,604
<i>Yoon Palbong is our prime target.</i>

25
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,356
<i>Better make damn sure
to break that bastard's legs.</i>

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,277
I will have to teach him a proper lesson
at the Innovation Party speech later.

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,737
-Don't you worry about him.
-Kill…

28
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,530
Yoon Palbong, quickly.

29
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,615
Huh?

30
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,408
During my time in America,

31
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,412
there was beauty and abundance
everywhere I'd look.

32
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,248
Meanwhile, my countrymen
were stripped bare and starving.

33
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,708
Do you know what pizza is?

34
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,044
<i>You know
what pizza tastes like?</i>

35
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,172
Have you really had it before?

36
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,256
Seohae Oil, Sail Developments
CEO Pak Doochill

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>I can tell just by looking into
someone's eyes,</i>

38
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>whether they'll make it or not.</i>

39
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,302
<i>You, Manager Kim,</i>

40
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,013
have potential to become president.

41
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,308
Well, at least Minister, for sure.

42
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,894
Yeah, maybe I'll call you Minister.

43
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,687
How long would it take to get it running?

44
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>I've got
a straight answer for you.</i>

45
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>Stop seeing Choo Yeojin.</i>

46
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,322
And if you're Choo Intae's son-in-law,
the dream will never be fulfilled.

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,033
The Reconstruction Bureau
is being shut down.

48
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,993
<i>The National Reconstruction Project…</i>

49
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,078
<i>I'm not gonna give it up.</i>

50
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,371
<i>Is it true you left
the Ministry of Home Affairs?</i>

51
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,499
Do you think there might be
a position for me in the Innovation Party?

52
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,669
I think The Innovation Party
isn't ready yet.

53
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>No matter how hard I try,</i>

54
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,173
<i>there's nothing that I can do.</i>

55
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,384
Effort is meaningless in this world.

56
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,636
Why not flip it upside down?

57
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>I have this dream.</i>

58
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,099
<i>There's a version of South Korea</i>

59
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,393
<i>that I want to create.</i>

60
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,727
Except that's not a real dream.

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,148
That's hypocrisy.

62
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,732
Hypocrisy dressed as a dream.

63
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,944
Then focus only on
what you want from now on!

64
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,279
Focus!

65
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,697
I want to revive it!

66
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,284
I want the National Reconstruction Project
to go forward!

67
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,746
<i>I'll break up with her.</i>

68
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,331
Leave.

69
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,750
<i>In life,</i>

70
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,795
<i>when you gain something,</i>

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>you're bound to lose something else.</i>

72
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,259
I have a great plan for us.

73
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,679
The Cheongwoo Federation will
eventually control the entire country.

74
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,098
A great plan?

75
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,225
The establishment of a parliament.

76
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,188
And we buy off
the entire National Assembly.

77
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,857
Is there really a need
to kill Yoon Palbong right away?

78
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,859
You'll need him for the next election.

79
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,943
I don't need him.

80
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,486
Give it to Taemin.

81
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,780
<i>I'm sure he's got
a grudge against Yoon Palbong.</i>

82
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,949
Who does he want dead now?

83
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>If the job gets done
the right way,</i>

84
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,746
<i>then you'll head to Osaka.</i>

85
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,081
I have evidence that

86
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,376
Kang Seongmin was an active member
of the Sineui Alliance.

87
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,422
Kang Seongmin has just put out
a hit on a certain Yoon Palbong.

88
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,883
<i>Oh, I'm here
to save Yoon Palbong.</i>

89
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,392
-Get out of my way, you dirtbag!
-Hey, wait! Ah, shit!

90
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,772
Haejun.

91
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,358
Oh, Haejun!

92
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,901
Fuck!

93
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,112
Kang Seongmin's father also died
in an explosive accident.

94
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,615
The Sineui Alliance
is known for using explosives.

95
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,034
The police report also states
that Yoon Palbong

96
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,744
was the first one to get shot.

97
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,580
It seems that Choo Intae
wasn't their initial target.

98
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,417
Uncle Samsik

99
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,933
Uncle Samsik

100
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,160
<i>Hello?</i>

101
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,536
Oh, Minister. Hello.

102
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,041
Yes.

103
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,293
Welcome.

104
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,721
What brings you here at this hour?

105
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,350
You know Cha Taemin
of the Sineui Alliance?

106
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,684
What?

107
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,312
Did you introduce
Yoon Palbong to Kwangmin,

108
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,855
so he could join the Party?

109
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,315
Yes.

110
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,108
And your tip-off
for the Kang Seongmin article?

111
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,319
Yes.

112
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,487
What'd you do that for?

113
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,783
Oh, I'll take my coffee later.

114
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,950
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

115
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,660
Yoon Palbong, uh,

116
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,623
did a lot of Kang Seongmin's
dirty work for him, you understand?

117
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,583
Of course, I was involved in some of it.

118
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,795
Yoon Palbong has betrayed Kang Seongmin.

119
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,005
- One coffee, please.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,841
Betrayed him, how?

121
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,885
Listen,

122
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,596
I can't go into those details
at the moment.

123
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,681
You said we had the same dream.

124
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,810
How can that be true
when you have so many secrets?

125
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,521
Well, it's just that
you're better off not knowing--

126
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,772
Mr. Choo Intae…

127
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,818
Did you order his assassination?

128
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,864
Again with that ridiculous imagination.

129
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,241
I broke up with Yeojin.

130
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,535
What exactly did you sacrifice?

131
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,830
You have quite the past, and you do
all these dangerous things in the shadows.

132
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,957
And you say we share a dream?

133
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,050
Did you see the article?

134
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,971
About An Yosub's son, An Minchul?

135
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,188
Yoon Palbong and I were the ones
who killed him.

136
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,691
3 years ago

137
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,109
If you need anything
for your districts,

138
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,819
feel free to direct
your requests to me.

139
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,571
I appreciate
the sentiment.

140
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,656
We're thankful
for all that you do.

141
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,241
Hello, Assemblyman Kang.

142
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
Ah, you're here.

143
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,414
You wanted to see me?

144
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,499
I saw the National Security Bureau
yesterday.

145
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,084
Something I heard intrigued me.

146
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,544
What was it?

147
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,045
Regarding Cha Taemin.

148
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,506
Didn't he work for you in the past?

149
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,469
Definitely not as laissez-faire
as they claim to be.

150
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,929
I noticed they only killed off
your political rivals.

151
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,599
Very clever thinking on your end.

152
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,228
Let me use those
Sineui guys when I need 'em too.

153
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,939
Sharing is caring, after all.

154
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,820
An Minchul found out about the Alliance.

155
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,947
Seongmin.

156
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,782
It's time to end this.

157
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,995
What?

158
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,790
We're heading for Osaka.

159
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,044
Uncle Samsik said he would
find jobs for us.

160
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,297
I can't do things like this.

161
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,717
Not anymore.

162
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,011
What's wrong?

163
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,600
I need you.

164
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,103
<i>Cha Taemin disobeyed
Kang Seongmin's orders.</i>

165
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,773
Assemblyman Kang.

166
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,902
On the way back here…

167
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,363
…this jerk confessed.

168
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,991
Can you catch Cha Taemin too?

169
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,328
Yeah, I'll find him.
I'll take all my guys with me.

170
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,080
Why don't you just let Taemin leave?

171
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,624
You know very well that this one

172
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,960
is the Sineui Alliance explosives expert.

173
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,670
We can make use of him.

174
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,965
Use his knowledge,
and we can take care of An Minchul.

175
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,181
All right.

176
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,061
Then would Mister Yoon here be able
to do a little more work for us?

177
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,521
Sure, why not? Of course.

178
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,314
What can I do for you in return?

179
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,024
I, uh…

180
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,945
You know those badges,
for the National Assembly?

181
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,656
It's always been my dream to wear one.

182
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,034
If you nominate me
for the Dongdaemun seat,

183
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,869
then I will…

184
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,330
I'll do anything.

185
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,884
There is someone I detest.

186
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,139
<i>Kang Seongmin gave orders
to Palbong to bring Taemin back to him.</i>

187
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,144
Think we'd let you live if you ran?

188
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,562
Tell Kang Seongmin

189
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,481
I won't be doing any more
of his dirty work.

190
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,400
Fucking traitors.

191
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,447
Did you think stowing away
like filthy rats

192
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,449
would stop me from catching you?

193
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,704
There is a way to get out alive.

194
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,498
It's simple.

195
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,171
Should we throw you
into the sea?

196
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,965
Or should we work together?

197
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,967
Huh?!

198
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,637
I… I'll do it.

199
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,140
I'll do it too.

200
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,686
I'll work with you.

201
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,940
<i>Palbong was blinded by the idea
of wearing that golden badge</i>

202
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,484
<i>and got his hands dirty.</i>

203
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,527
<i>He caught Taemin mid-escape.</i>

204
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,989
<i>And also killed An Minchul.</i>

205
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,107
Minchul!

206
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,702
Cha Taemin betrayed Kang Seongmin.

207
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,582
So Palbong and I ended up killing
Assemblyman An Minchul instead that day.

208
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,084
Palbong couldn't keep
his mouth shut about it

209
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,586
so we had no choice but to get rid of him.

210
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,755
Why did you introduce him
to the Innovation Party?

211
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,509
Because he was so obsessed
with getting a National Assembly badge,

212
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,720
I thought getting him
the Innovation Party's nomination

213
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,971
would shut him up.

214
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,265
What'd you release that article for?

215
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,976
To slowly bleed Kang Seongmin dry.

216
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,061
That man is not to be taken lightly.

217
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,731
We need to take away his power
little by little.

218
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,067
Yeah, in order to eliminate him later.

219
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,363
Where is Cha Taemin now?

220
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,244
In a secure hiding place.

221
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,309
Mister Cha Taemin?

222
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,647
Mister Cha Taemin?

223
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,692
Hey, there's a door here.

224
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,041
Hey.

225
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,918
Don't move. Who are you?

226
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,962
Where is Cha Taemin?

227
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,421
I'm also here to look for Cha Taemin.

228
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,006
You're on Cha Taemin's side!

229
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
- That… that's not it.
- Where is Cha Taemin?

230
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,677
-Tell me now!
-No, don't!

231
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,761
Why did you bring these people?

232
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,889
I swear I didn't bring them here.

233
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,561
Then why did you come?

234
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,731
We didn't agree to meet today.

235
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,608
To let you know that it's dangerous,

236
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,693
that we had to move you somewhere else.

237
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,029
You weren't gonna let me go to Japan,
were you?

238
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,572
I don't know about that.

239
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,833
Is Uncle Samsik behind this?

240
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,418
No, he's not.

241
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,963
I thought you didn't know.

242
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,759
Uncle Samsik sent me to tell you
that it's dangerous here.

243
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,053
That we had to move you
somewhere safe.

244
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,474
But Uncle Samsik…

245
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,606
he abandoned me once before.

246
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,228
Sineui Alliance Charter

247
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,523
The Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct
Kang Seongmin

248
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,499
Who are you?

249
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,418
Oh.

250
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,004
I, uh, I used to, uh, I used to work here.

251
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,529
What are you doing here?

252
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,239
Where's Taemin?

253
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,241
I was wondering the same thing.

254
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,885
- Hm.
- These items were found here.

255
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,678
There are also traces of bombs being made.

256
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,139
Ah, is that so?

257
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,892
Destroy all of it.

258
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,643
Sorry?

259
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,645
You didn't hear me?

260
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,898
Destroy all of it. Do it immediately.

261
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,111
Sir, take a look at this.

262
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,113
- Should we burn these too?
- Burn it.

263
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,166
The Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct

264
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,087

Sineui Alliance Charter

266
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
Hello?

267
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,515
Uncle Samsik.

268
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,894
Yes, it's me.

269
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,646
So. Has he been moved?

270
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,564
- <i>There was an incident.
</i>- What?

271
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,691
<i>It appears that Pak Jiwook
sent some of his men.</i>

272
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,944
<i>Three of them, and Taemin killed them all.</i>

273
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,321
Huh? What? He…

274
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,490
He killed all three?

275
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,659
<i>Yes, well,
it all happened so fast.</i>

276
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,412
He's suspicious of you, Uncle Samsik.
He thinks you tried to kill him.

277
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,539
What?

278
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,625
<i>I happened to stumble upon
the Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct</i>

279
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,044
<i>with Kang Seongmin's signature on it.</i>

280
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,754
<i>But Pak Jiwook burned everything.</i>

281
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,131
Kang Seongmin's signature?

282
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,424
<i>That's definitive proof that
Kang Seongmin established</i>

283
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,260
-<i>the Sineui Alliance.</i>
-Yes.

284
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,636
And he burned it?

285
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,638
<i>I saw him burning it, yes.</i>

286
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,722
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

287
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,976
Uh, all right.

288
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,061
Good work.

289
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,908
Pak Jiwook's put a tail on me.

290
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,160
Of the Liberal Party?

291
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,412
Yes, formerly a Japanese cop.

292
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,999
Of all the people he could have hired,
he picked this scrawny guy.

293
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,459
And it appears he sent people
after Cha Taemin.

294
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,879
Taemin…

295
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Ah.

296
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,590
Forget it, let's just go.

297
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,945
How is a Korean
so good at singing jazz?

298
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,156
Who knows?

299
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,743
Maybe one day,
we'll even beat you in baseball.

300
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,704
Ah, this guy.

301
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,788
Eh?

302
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,461
Hey, uh, you know Choo Intae?
The guy who got shot.

303
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,922
I heard he's got a bit of a following.

304
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,051
Hey, don't worry about that.

305
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,135
Never gonna happen.

306
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,347
I know.

307
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,851
But still, we had riot control training.

308
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,145
At the American headquarters?

309
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,730
Mm.

310
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,858
We even conducted evacuation drills

311
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,195
for the US embassy
and the government personnel.

312
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,489
Oh, shit.

313
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,076
But that's never gonna happen.

314
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,119
Well,

315
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,496
never say never.

316
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,457
Never say never.

317
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,000
Never say never.

318
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,339
Wish you a swift recovery, Mr. Choo

319
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,339
Wish you a swift recovery, Mr. Choo

320
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,840
How many people turned up?

321
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,342
Around 200 people?

322
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,593
They keep coming.

323
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,597
Ilmo Hospital

324
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,014
My father has just…

325
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,810
He has passed away.

326
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,898
According to the wishes
of the party,

327
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,276
and for the future

328
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,321
of the Innovation Party…

329
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,826
Ladies and gentlemen!

330
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,786
This was not an accident!

331
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,665
We have to reveal the truth
about what happened!

332
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,379
Mister Choo Intae was
unquestionably assassinated!

333
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,132
Whoever did this must be revealed!

334
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,262
We deserve to know the reason
that this happened to him!

335
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,014
Let's go, everyone!

336
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,392
Let's all walk over to the alley
where Mister Choo was shot!

337
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,896
- Let's bring him back!
- Let's bring back Choo Intae!

338
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,065
Let's bring him back!

339
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,858
Follow me! Let's go!

340
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,867
I'll go to the hospital now.

341
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,827
All right.

342
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,871
Mister Oh.

343
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,583
Do what you can to… comfort Yeojin.

344
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,421
Okay.

345
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,718
Everyone!

346
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,139
Democracy is officially dead!

347
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,974
- That's right!
- Justice for Choo Intae!

348
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,560
They were all terrified
of losing their power!

349
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:21,691
An investigation must be performed
for absolute certainty!

350
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,611
We must reveal the identities

351
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,657
of whoever is behind
Mister Choo Intae's death!

352
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,496
Choo Intae!

353
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,831
How many people have gathered?

354
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,375
Is the riot squad there?

355
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,754
Is that enough to regulate
a crowd that size?

356
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,552
Bring back Choo Intae!

357
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,220
Soojin, I'll be right back.

358
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,391
The current administration
must step down!

359
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,268
Bring back Choo Intae!

360
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,271
Bring back Choo Intae!

361
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,732
Bring back Choo Intae!

362
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,027
Everyone! The community's out there.

363
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,612
Let's join the march!

364
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,698
Let's go!

365
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,077
Come on, everyone! This way!

366
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,584
We must reveal the truth!
We will find the truth!

367
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,096
- Bring back Choo Intae!
- Prepare to fire!

368
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,265
Bring back Choo Intae!

369
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,059
Innovation is
the only way forward!

370
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,061
This protest must end now!

371
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,855
Disperse immediately!

372
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,233
- Step down! Step down!
- Bring back Choo Intae!

373
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,694
- If you do not disperse, we will shoot!
- Bring back Choo Intae!

374
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,822
- Disperse now!
- Bring back Choo Intae!

375
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,699
Bring back Choo Intae!

376
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,035
Bring back Choo Intae!

377
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,247
The current administration
must step down immediately!

378
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,500
Step down!

379
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,586
Choo Intae!

380
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,171
Ladies and gentlemen,

381
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,132
Mister Choo Intae's daughter
is now coming up to speak!

382
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,636
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

383
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,305
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

384
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,183
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

385
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,102
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

386
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,522
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

387
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,274
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

388
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,652
Everyone!

389
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,490
- We need to clear out!
- Why?

390
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,202
- We can't. No way!
- Why should we disperse?

391
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,662
What's this all about?

392
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,498
A demonstration like this…

393
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,502
isn't what he wanted.

394
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,298
This is not what my father fought for.

395
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,510
Nor what he believed in.

396
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,304
Violence and chaos

397
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,182
are not what he stood for.

398
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,602
My father stood for the opposite.

399
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,229
Prosperity for all.

400
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:06,982
Coexistence…

401
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,818
and harmony.

402
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,322
Not for us to all die together.

403
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,242
And our party's future…

404
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,370
must be democratic…

405
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,873
and be peaceful,

406
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,919
as per my father's wishes.

407
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,464
All of us

408
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,759
have to clear out right now,

409
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,472
in accordance with his wishes.

410
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,643
We've got to ensure

411
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,981
no one else's blood is shed.

412
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,126
Choo Intae!

413
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,588
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

414
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,298
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

415
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,769
You see?
I told you that nothing would happen.

416
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,978
We don't know that yet.

417
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,483
Kang Seongmin will now try to pass
the Local Government Act

418
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,901
under everyone's noses.

419
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,945
And when he does, you <i>have</i> to make sure
your presence is known.

420
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,989
You mean go up against Kang Seongmin?

421
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,659
Just as I thought, you catch on quickly.

422
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,077
We need him to get it passed.

423
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,704
His reputation can't be changed
with the Liberals.

424
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,332
That's it, I have nothing else
to teach you now.

425
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,792
And I will get in his way

426
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,419
and be thought of
as a champion for democracy, right?

427
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,923
Let's have another drink.

428
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,931
<i>Last night at 9:45 p.m.,</i>

429
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,141
<i>the Innovation Party's
presidential candidate,</i>

430
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,560
<i>Mister Choo Intae, passed away.</i>

431
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,397
<i>Mister Choo Intae had
a high approval rating</i>

432
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,273
<i>and a strong chance of becoming President</i>

433
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,442
<i>when he was attacked by an assailant.</i>

434
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,319
<i>The anarchist group,</i>

435
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,781
<i>the Sineui Alliance,
is rumored to have committed the crime.</i>

436
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,119
<i>Political commentators
are projecting that this incident</i>

437
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,706
<i>will have a negative effect on the chances
of President Rhee's reelection.</i>

438
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,796
<i>The approval rating for
the Democratic Party candidate</i>

439
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,923
<i>had already been skyrocketing.</i>

440
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:41,720
<i>The public is now keenly focused on
how this incident will affect</i>

441
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,888
<i>the results of the presidential election.</i>

442
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,731
So, this here…

443
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,983
Yeah, it's the assemblymen

444
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,901
against the Local Government Act.

445
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,737
How many are there in total?

446
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,325
All things considered,
I think it'll be around twenty people.

447
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,579
And without their votes,
the parliamentary system

448
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,247
has no chance of being reformed?

449
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,791
I guess not.

450
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,919
So then what are we
supposed to do exactly

451
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,547
with this list of fools?
We can't just buy them all off.

452
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,435
There's around twenty assemblymen
opposing the Local Government Act.

453
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,816
A clear attack on me, isn't it?

454
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,527
Well, we haven't received
the campaign funding.

455
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,490
So is An Yosub trying
to bleed me dry then?

456
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,574
Shit.

457
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,077
All right, sir.

458
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,500
Go and meet with Mister An Yosub,
and hurry.

459
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,342
Sail Bakery

460
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,392
Hey, got a lighter?

461
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,437
-Me?
-Yeah, kid, come on.

462
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,272
It's gotta be hard, following me around.

463
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,816
Why are you here every day?

464
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,610
- I get in trouble if I don't.
- Hand me the lighter.

465
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,364
I heard the police force fired you
for taking bribes.

466
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,534
Yes.

467
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,412
Here. No one will find out.

468
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,123
Take it,
go buy yourself a bowl of <i>gukbap</i>.

469
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,503
You know, you don't have to be
Pak Jiwook's lackey, you idiot.

470
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,838
Do your best.

471
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,055
Excuse me?

472
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,391
-Me?
-This bread's for you.

473
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,478
He'll be heading out very soon
to meet Michael Jeong.

474
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,646
He says to report that.

475
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,275
Thank you very much.

476
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,801
How's Yeojin?

477
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,969
Have you called her?

478
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,346
Got a light?

479
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,351
Are you all right?

480
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,027
- You're here early.
- Can't you ever be on time?

481
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,403
Why are you always late? Huh?

482
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,363
The commander suddenly wanted
some things done.

483
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,449
- Like what?
- Personal things.

484
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,452
Taking care of his plants
and his ceramics.

485
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,871
This is what Academy grads
end up doing.

486
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,583
Fuck. This is why we need to
turn the world upside down.

487
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,627
Hanmin.

488
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,257
Don't talk about it, make it happen.

489
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,384
What?

490
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,386
Don't just talk about it.

491
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,139
Do something about it.

492
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,435
Yeah, then what?

493
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,603
Will you join me?

494
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,482
That depends on what you do.

495
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,114
Oh, I'll show you how I change the world.

496
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,784
That's how
you should handle it.

497
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,205
Right.

498
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,749
We have been receiving calls
from all over the place.

499
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,586
The way they're all crying out for money.

500
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,590
Yes, in a matter of moments,
Kang Seongmin will come in here

501
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,800
to beg and plead in remorse--

502
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,468
Why have the withdrawals stopped?

503
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,472
Don't you realize how it affects
my reputation?

504
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,058
Sir, please, the thing is,

505
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,601
it wasn't for a lack of trying…

506
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,894
I told him not to.

507
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,731
Why?

508
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,943
Because of that ridiculous article?

509
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,945
Was it truly ridiculous?

510
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,701
Would you please excuse us?

511
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,056
What are you doing?

512
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,356
I know that you are suspicious of me.

513
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,402
Yes, I was part of the Sineui Alliance.

514
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,616
I wrote the Sineui Alliance
Code of Conduct.

515
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,701
No…

516
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,912
The Sineui Alliance was created by me.

517
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,667
I was young and foolish and committed
an unforgivable crime.

518
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,835
I apologize.

519
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,256
But, sir,

520
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,383
I didn't…

521
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:18,598
I was not involved in the death of your…
of Min… Assemblyman An Minchul.

522
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,725
Please believe me.

523
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,894
Okay?

524
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,234
Minchul was someone I looked up to
like a brother.

525
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,237
Why would I kill someone like that?

526
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,031
Because you were after his position.

527
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
No, sir.

528
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,162
I saw the way you looked at Minchul.

529
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,497
You were envious.

530
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,794
Of course, I was envious.

531
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,338
It's true.

532
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,883
I envied him, and so…

533
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,636
I held him in great esteem.

534
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,389
Minchul's dream, I can…

535
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,975
I can make it happen.

536
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,311
I will.

537
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,563
Please? Just this once.

538
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,566
Give me one more chance, please.

539
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,651
You really

540
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,487
didn't kill my son?

541
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,867
Please, you need to believe me.

542
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,370
Then who killed my son, and why?

543
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,831
Why did they do it?

544
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,332
I'll find that out, I will.

545
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,584
I promise. And I'll tell you.

546
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,879
Sir.

547
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,966
If the Federation casts me aside,

548
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,385
I have nowhere to go, sir, nowhere.

549
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,971
I'll call you Father.

550
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,097
I will!

551
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,224
You have my unwavering loyalty!

552
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,560
Please. Just this once, help me out!

553
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,895
Just this once. Save me, please.

554
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,523
I need you. Okay?

555
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,444
Choi Minkyu…

556
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,906
promised to give you control,

557
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,367
and to set you up as his successor.

558
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,539
Yes, sir.

559
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,332
Yes, but…

560
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,919
I have never thought about betraying
the Cheongwoo Federation, I promise.

561
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,130
And how will you prove that?

562
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,965
I'll do what's required of me.

563
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,719
-What's required?
-Yes, whatever it takes!

564
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,889
How about becoming Prime Minister?

565
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,519
Take control of the Liberal Party

566
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,479
and get 100 people together.

567
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:35,026
Sun Wooseok will bring about
50 from the Democratic Party.

568
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,362
The newly-appointed
and independents of the Assembly

569
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,200
the Cheongwoo Federation supports,
they make up another 20 to 30.

570
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,247
We create a new party
with those 170 seats,

571
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,292
plus you can become the Prime Minister.

572
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,586
How about it?

573
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,172
Can you gather 100 men?

574
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,092
Yes, I can do it.

575
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,471
I will make it happen.

576
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,931
Yes.

577
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,350
No matter what. I will.

578
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,565
You are my son

579
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,652
in Minchul's place.

580
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,280
Thank you, sir.

581
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,246
I mean it. Thank you, sir.

582
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,876
He's probably grasping onto Yosub's hands
and sobbing right about now.

583
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,170
Completely unaware he's taken the bait.

584
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,713
<i>I'm sure Kang Seongmin
would be grateful.</i>

585
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,340
Yes, of course, he would.

586
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,634
He would've never imagined this role.

587
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,888
That kid has been in the palm of my hand
since the day I bottle-fed him.

588
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,682
Hey, why are there so many US soldiers?

589
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,933
<i>US soldiers?</i>

590
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,020
Something doesn't feel right here.

591
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,233
I heard it almost became
an all-out riot.

592
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,026
It would have,
if not for Choo Intae's daughter.

593
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,070
Hey. She was his fiancee.

594
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,281
Must've been heartbreaking for you.

595
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,203
- Hey.
- Hey.

596
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,705
- Hey.
- Hey, Harrison.

597
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,957
Did you hear?

598
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,959
It's a mess out there.

599
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,085
What's the matter?

600
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,754
Ah, the younger officers
issued a declaration.

601
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,548
About what?

602
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,466
See it for yourself.

603
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,103
"We condemn all factions, corruption,

604
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,564
and political activities
within the military."

605
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,983
"We will discipline
all military personnel

606
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,735
involved in fraudulent elections.

607
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,654
We will enforce punishments
on generals involved in corruption.

608
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,282
We demand new reform
within the military."

609
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,868
"We demand
better treatment of soldiers.

610
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,331
We are young officers who devoted
our youth to serving our country.

611
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,376
We young officers have endured
our impoverished realities

612
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,836
with pride as soldiers.

613
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,381
We demand the punishment
of the corrupt generals

614
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,468
who trample on our pride."

615
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,513
Have you seen this declaration?

616
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,557
Yes.

617
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,975
I wrote it.

618
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,020
Oh.

619
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,150
It seems most young officers
are in agreement with this declaration.

620
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,070
There's also new intelligence
from the US Army.

621
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,411
Uh, I will be sure to keep
the military under control.

622
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,163
The Assembly can be bought

623
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,374
but not the military.

624
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,250
The occupation taught us that.

625
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,252
What other intelligence was there?

626
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,757
The military looks set to
appoint a new First Operations Commander.

627
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,134
A new commander?

628
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,262
General Choi Hanrim is
highly regarded within the military.

629
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,765
He's also very close with
the US Army Commander.

630
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,145
Choi Hanrim?

631
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,274
Did you first meet
First Operations Commander Choi Hanrim

632
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,943
at the Albright farewell party?

633
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,736
Yes, I met him there.

634
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,696
Is that when you discussed
the coup d'état?

635
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,161
General Choi Hanrim was the soldier
that I had the utmost admiration for.

636
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,248
<i>He helped me
when I needed it most.</i>

637
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,332
General Choi Hanrim
First Operations Commander

638
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,962
He was just like a father to me.

639
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,968
Our dear Minister has so many
different father figures.

640
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,930
And so many he admires as well.

641
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,183
Unfortunately,

642
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,645
those fathers… are all dead now.
