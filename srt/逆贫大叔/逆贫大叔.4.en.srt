1
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,509
I caught these punks
at the last second

2
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,076
trying to escape the country.

3
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>Hyung.</i>

4
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,222
You trying to abandon me and get away?

5
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,477
Seongmin.

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,021
You…

7
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,232
you've deceived us.

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,451
What did I do?

9
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,536
The Sineui Alliance is worthless.

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,956
It's a puppet exploited by your ambitions.

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,042
Why should we…

12
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,920
why should we kill people for you?

13
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,037
You shouldn't've made the Sineui Alliance
if you wanted to become an assemblyman.

14
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,311
Is that why you betrayed me?

15
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,005
Mister Kang, listen.

16
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,134
Taemin. We should forgive him.

17
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,681
Our dreams were almost destroyed…

18
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,185
by someone whose head
I put a roof over, someone I raised.

19
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,770
Exactly.

20
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,524
So please, just let Taemin live.

21
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,652
I'll send him off to the salt farms
and keep a close eye on him.

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,627
UNCLE SAMSIK

23
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,143
UNCLE SAMSIK

24
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:52,148
THE GREAT PLAN

25
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,821
It was the day that
the president announced his candidacy.

26
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,994
All his supporters
were out in the streets.

27
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh, you finally picked up.

28
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,239
No matter how hard I try,

29
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,328
there's nothing that I can do.

30
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,665
Effort is meaningless in this world.

31
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,875
Why not flip it upside down?

32
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,921
And what if it's wrong?

33
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,381
Then spit it out.

34
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,217
You'll know if it's poison
the minute it touches your lips.

35
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,094
And my proposal?

36
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,014
Can we save it?

37
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,391
Save it or kill it, we can do anything.

38
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,744
I'm asking
if we can make it happen naturally?

39
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,270
Letting it happen on its own

40
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,147
will also cost you.

41
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,734
Does the Earth's rotation and revolution
just happen?

42
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,403
Is it a coincidence
that the Sun lights up the Earth?

43
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,628
I want more power. Tell me how to get it.

44
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,742
I will give it to you.

45
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,995
I'm the one who can give it to you.

46
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,956
I'll wait to hear from you.

47
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,887
DECEMBER 22, 1959
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

48
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,890
{\an8}BANYA HOTEL

49
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,530
{\an8}Oh.

50
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,866
{\an8}This way.

51
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,545
{\an8}I assume that you know
what kind of meeting this is?

52
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,589
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,134
You cannot breathe a word of
what is discussed here outside this room.

54
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,220
I'll keep that in mind.

55
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,473
We have also reviewed
your National Reconstruction proposal.

56
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,393
I have got some big plans for you.

57
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,937
Yeah, great plans too, I'll tell you that.

58
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,189
Whether it's money or power,

59
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,274
I can provide everything.

60
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,118
You want influence?
I can get you married in.

61
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,861
Well, I'm already engaged to be married.

62
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,780
Hmm?

63
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,282
Mister Choo Intae's daughter is,
well, she's my fiance.

64
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,118
What did you say?

65
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,538
You and Choo Intae's daughter are what?

66
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,498
I said we're engaged.

67
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,709
Choo Intae?
You're gonna be his son-in-law?

68
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,087
I have great respect for Choo Intae.

69
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,172
I respect him
more than anyone else I know.

70
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,804
You said they were done.

71
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,391
Yes. I think it's a misunderstanding,
that's all.

72
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,642
Misunderstanding?

73
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,018
He says he respects him!

74
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,772
Yes, it's true,
I have a lot of respet for him, but…

75
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,056
I don't understand why that's…

76
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,820
You clearly don't know
what this meeting is.

77
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,031
Ah, will you excuse us while we go
and straighten this all out?

78
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,533
Please step out with me.

79
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,910
Get up.

80
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,082
Right this way.

81
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,253
Wait. What was all that?

82
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,440
Keep seeing her, but in secret.
Just three more years.

83
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,090
Oh, that is total nonsense.

84
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,176
Three years goes by fast. Huh?

85
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,760
I will not stop seeing Yeojin.

86
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,220
Why did you come here then?

87
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,223
To realize my dream for South Korea.

88
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,766
You've gotta sleep to have dreams.

89
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,810
How are you dreaming without sleeping?

90
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,856
The Cheongwoo Federation's a bed
and Chairman An Yosub is a pillow!

91
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,484
You need to get in that bed
with your head on that pillow.

92
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,696
We're not on the same page.

93
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,990
To get on the same page, you gotta listen.

94
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,877
He's acting so high and mighty.

95
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,422
I think I may have sweet talked him
a little too much.

96
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,257
It's gone to his head.

97
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,176
Should I follow him?

98
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,303
Yeah. Let's see where he goes.

99
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,767
Sir, we…
we don't want to get involved

100
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,018
with Choo Intae, do we?

101
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,771
I mean, there's no benefit.
He would be useless to us.

102
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,190
We should find someone else, right?

103
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,442
We can find someone better.

104
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,448
He understands now. I explained it.

105
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,201
He's not our guy. No.

106
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,203
I get it, but when he left,
he said he would

107
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,872
end things with Choo's daughter,
with Choo Yeojin.

108
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,792
Do you think he is capable
of beating Kang Seongmin?

109
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,794
He's too green.

110
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,548
I just need a little longer
to work on him, sir.

111
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,902
- Oh, they're coming out.
- Hey, she's out now.

112
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,344
- Here they are.
- Here she is.

113
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,613
Congratulations on your discharge.

114
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,805
ILMO HOSPITAL

115
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,141
Excuse me.

116
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,145
- Will you be okay?
- Yes.

117
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,611
Choo Intae!

118
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,572
- Choo Intae!
- Thank you, everyone.

119
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,282
Thank you, fellow citizens. Thank you.

120
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,158
Thank you very much.

121
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,495
He's really there right now?

122
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,247
Yes.

123
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,624
Choo Intae!

124
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,459
Acting friendly, posing with them.

125
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,795
<i>Posing with them?
Why would he pose with them?</i>

126
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,714
Oh, he just couldn't sit still, could he?

127
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,674
They've got their arms around each other.

128
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,635
Gosh, they look like a family already.

129
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,345
Their arms are around each other?

130
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,722
Yeah.

131
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,562
Sir, did you check
the polls this morning?

132
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
Oh yes.

133
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:11,485
The polls are showing us that the people
are desperate to maintain democracy.

134
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,489
So does this mean your daughter
will be active within the party?

135
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,408
Yes, I will.

136
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,662
This particular incident emphasized to me
the values that we must protect

137
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,415
as well as the importance
of this election.

138
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,292
That's right!

139
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,755
You're Kim San
of the Ministry of Home Affairs, right?

140
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,839
Yes.

141
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,259
Do you play a particular role
within the Innovation Party?

142
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,138
I am not a politician.

143
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,515
I've come here today on personal time.

144
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,039
All right, now let's leave it there.

145
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,478
We're gonna make our way
to Innovation Party headquarters.

146
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,854
Should we head over there?

147
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,859
- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

148
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,029
- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

149
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,822
- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

150
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,328
I'm heading to the office now.

151
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,790
Are you sure you feel up to it?

152
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,917
Yeah, of course.

153
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,127
All right.

154
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,063
Does this mean you're joining the party?

155
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm thinking about it.

156
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,598
There's really no need to force it.

157
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,021
I'll be in touch.

158
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,323
How dare you show up here?

159
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,825
I could tell you the same thing.

160
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,244
Why are you here?

161
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,413
All right, how is this, Minister?

162
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,833
You promise me you'll see Yeojin in secret
and I'll recommend you

163
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,919
for the chairman of the Democratic Party's
Economic Policy Committee.

164
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,630
- In secret?
- Away from prying eyes.

165
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,717
How could I possibly become
chairman of that committee?

166
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,385
I've told you before, it's nothing.

167
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,846
Look, we've got a great plan here,
Minister, involving you.

168
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,930
So… so what…

169
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,293
what is this great plan of yours?

170
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,509
Well, what do you plan to do?

171
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,477
- End it?
- No.

172
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,937
Date her in secret?

173
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,499
Tell me what this damn great plan is
you keep mentioning.

174
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,043
Now you're changing the subject again.

175
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,420
I think you're great, but I don't like
this side of you, Minister.

176
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,028
I'm changing the subject here?

177
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,072
That's what you're doing.
I hate when you do this.

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,971
{\an8}How long's it been since you had
any contact with Mister Kim Kwangmin?

180
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,049
You knew that Samsik won him over,
didn't you?

181
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,886
I'm really not sure.

182
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,763
- How about the invite list?
- Here you go.

183
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,557
We were only able to pay
for the print material.

184
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,226
The issue is the campaign vehicle.

185
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,697
At this rate, we won't be able
to keep up with the campaign schedule.

186
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,816
What brings you here?

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,026
Well, I was worried.

188
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,278
Ah, that's really kind.

189
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,362
Yeojin.

190
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,282
They said no bus for us
until we pay off the balance.

191
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,205
What do we do
about our upcoming events though?

192
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,871
Listen, if you need a campaign bus, I…

193
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,082
I know some folks
who'd be interesting in sponsoring.

194
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,751
Should I get them in touch with you?

195
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,518
Miss Yeojin.

196
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,978
Um, where'd you get these buses?

197
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,397
They're buses that US troops discarded.

198
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,107
Oh yeah, they're great, right?

199
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,277
It's nice to meet you.

200
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,738
Oh, and I am Yoon Palbong.

201
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,495
That's why
Kim Kwangmin introduced Yoon Palbong

202
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,746
to the Innovation Party.

203
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,077
Didn't you know about that?

204
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,168
I was unaware.

205
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,504
Hey.

206
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,966
I don't like Choo Intae.

207
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,050
I know.

208
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,554
But I still have to do this, don't I?

209
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,638
Yes.

210
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,473
Did you finish the book?

211
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,559
I almost had an aneurysm reading this,
you jerk.

212
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,484
The path of coexistence

213
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,283
Father, these are some of San's friends.

214
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,203
Oh, sir… No, I… Sir, I, um…

215
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,080
Would you sign this?

216
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,166
That's done then.
Thank you for your hard work.

217
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,354
I said you shouldn't come here, didn't I?

218
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,089
Hey, hey.
I don't have a lot of time right now.

219
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,674
What if someone sees you in here?

220
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,217
Tell Kang Seongmin

221
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,888
that I am now Choo Intae's
campaign security officer.

222
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,723
Wow.

223
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,076
It's amazing how things work out
when you actually listen.

224
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,727
- Yes.
- And did you hide that book

225
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,811
that I gave you?

226
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,523
<i>Yes, I hid it very well
inside Choo Intae's office.</i>

227
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,192
If Choo goes down,
you'll deserve all the credit.

228
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,362
Can you do me a favor,
and tell Kang that I'm doing a good job?

229
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,990
All right, but why are you worrying
about that, huh?

230
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,951
Thank you.

231
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,206
When will you kill Yoon Palbong?

232
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,541
The plan is in motion.

233
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,669
And why are these plans taking so long?

234
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,462
What if Minkyu finds out about it?

235
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,715
I wanted to ensure it's done in the safest
and most convincing way possible.

236
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,718
And I am telling you that
it would be safest to kill him quickly!

237
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,099
Seriously, Uncle, who else but you
is willing to listen to my nagging?

238
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,477
- I'll speed up the process.
- All right.

239
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
Have you met with Cha Taemin?

240
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,694
Not yet.

241
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,824
You mean, you don't want Taemin doing it?

242
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,702
It's not that.

243
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,541
It's just that he's repenting
and keeping a low profile right now, so…

244
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,667
is it necessary?

245
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,878
Taemin tore my heart wide open.

246
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,255
He betrayed me.

247
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,924
During my greatest time of need,
Cha Taemin abandoned me!

248
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,050
He left me!

249
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,637
If he wants my forgiveness,

250
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,348
tell him that no matter what,

251
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,684
he must do this.

252
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,264
- Take those off him.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,947
You must resent me a lot.

254
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,950
I do not resent anyone.

255
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,287
If I did, I would've left already.

256
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,708
Yeah. I'm sure you would have.

257
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,006
Who's he want dead now?

258
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,429
Yoon Palbong.

259
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,349
Yoon Palbong?

260
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,104
Who killed An Yosub's son?
That Yoon Palbong?

261
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,446
Yeah, that Yoon Palbong.

262
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,346
If the job gets done the right way,
then you'll head to Osaka…

263
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,571
I know.
I understand how you feel.

264
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,614
I swear I didn't betray Kang!

265
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,908
Kang Seongmin's the one who betrayed us!

266
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,536
He's the one who manipulated
the Sineui Alliance!

267
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
You're right, he did.

268
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,291
All right? Of course I know that.

269
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,296
And yet Yoon Palbong deserves to die
for what he did.

270
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,881
You know, don't you?

271
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,842
There was an opportunity in Busan,
wasn't there?

272
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,969
If Yoon Palbong hadn't killed An Minchul,

273
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,013
Kang Seongmin wouldn't be
the mess that he is now.

274
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,309
Yoon Palbong. Who brought him to us?

275
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,644
Uncle Samsik, was it you?

276
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,067
There is someone I detest.

277
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,448
Look, I'm sorry.

278
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,533
Back then,
I thought he was showing his loyalty.

279
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,041
Kang Seongmin.

280
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,003
What are you planning to do with him?

281
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,382
I'll have to stop him,
and end his political career.

282
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,303
He has to be stopped before
he even gets close to being president.

283
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,641
Go and get your freedom in Osaka.

284
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,316
I have evidence

285
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,945
that Seongmin was
an active member of the Sineui Alliance.

286
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,409
This is where Kang and I
formed the Sineui Alliance.

287
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,747
We created the rules,
regulations, and even homemade bombs.

288
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,626
Wow, this is so old, it's…

289
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,296
It's hard to say exactly who it is.

290
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,884
{\an8}MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS

291
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,637
In the major cities,
Choo Intae has absolutely taken the lead.

292
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,973
We must curb his rise.

293
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,433
And how do we do that?

294
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,730
You people aren't here to write reviews!

295
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,318
And the Local Government Act?

296
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,279
We'll start off by…
by holding a public hearing...

297
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,364
Public hearing? What?

298
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,782
Do you all have time to waste?

299
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,116
Am I the only one concerned?

300
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,112
Get everyone's help on this.

301
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,537
Everyone. Military, civil servants.

302
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,459
Yes, yes.
I'll find out and get back to you.

303
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,967
{\an8}- They're all having a field day.

304
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,344
{\an8}They need to be threatened.

305
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,180
There's lots of opposition
within the party, sir.

306
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,991
The longer we take,
the more we have to lose.

307
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,184
Steal it from under their noses
if we have to.

308
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,354
Go and see Assemblyman Pak.

309
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,732
{\an8}NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

310
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,152
You've seen the export price
Sanae Produce has requested, is that so?

311
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,532
Yes. They've requested flour
as the form of payment.

312
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,076
Flour.

313
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,746
- No objections?
- No.

314
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,270
All right then.
We'll leave it there.

315
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,459
Well done today.

316
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,585
Jiwook?

317
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,214
Stop dozing off during meetings.

318
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
Boring, isn't it?

319
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,060
All this about imports and payments.

320
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,937
Gosh, it really gives me a headache.

321
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,898
We need to get our Mister Pak
back to doing what he does best.

322
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,571
We need to get
the Local Government Act passed quickly.

323
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,740
Seems to be a lot of people opposed to it.

324
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,910
And that's exactly why we need your help.

325
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,914
What? Whatever for?

326
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,207
Our time's running out.

327
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,129
Hello.

328
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,380
It's been a while.

329
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,191
- It's been a long time.
- It's good to see you, man.

330
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,216
Let's head inside.

331
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,053
Boss. We're here.

332
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,431
- Hmm.
- How have you been? Good?

333
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,558
Yeah, yeah. It's been a while.

334
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,121
How have you been spending your time?

335
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,022
I left the police force
and I started a business for a while

336
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,106
but gave that up.

337
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,695
You all seem like
you're a little worse off now than before.

338
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,447
We're all barely surviving.

339
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,284
We'll take any job you've got.

340
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,560
Why didn't you go
to the Innovation Party

341
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,503
when Choo Intae had
a high approval rating?

342
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,922
Why'd you take the chairman position

343
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,549
of the Democratic Party
Economic Policy Committee?

344
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,926
Because of Samsik?

345
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,932
Hey, look who it is.

346
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,522
Will you stop coming here
trying to win me over with stuff to eat?

347
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,398
Oh, I bought this for me.

348
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,234
You want some of it?

349
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,194
Why are you here?

350
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,863
Have you ever heard of
Sun Wooseok of the new faction?

351
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,074
Yes. I know who he is.

352
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,952
Right. Well, this Sun Wooseok,
cannot say the word "no" to me.

353
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,036
Why is that?

354
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,664
'Cause the guy has accepted
so many of my bribes.

355
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,709
Anyway, if you join
the Democrats through Sun,

356
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,086
join their new faction,

357
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,797
I can make you
their Economic Policy Committee chair.

358
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,799
You'll be in charge of
pledges for the election.

359
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,842
This is the last time I'm coming to ask.
If you don't want it, tell me now.

360
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,227
A couple of radishes, some potatoes,
add some scallions, minced garlic,

361
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,604
some chili powder,
let it simmer and enjoy.

362
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,398
Nothing better on cold nights like these.

363
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,191
- Forget it.
- Please enjoy it.

364
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,404
They're also good grilled.

365
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,914
So, I read through the National
Reconstruction Plan of yours, huh?

366
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,417
You really think you got a shot?

367
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,644
Well, with large-scale loans
and investments...

368
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,587
There are so many in America
willing to invest.

369
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,463
And I personally know
a lot of these people.

370
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,066
They've been calling me about it non-stop.

371
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,484
We must push
for US economic agreement...

372
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,861
Yes, the economic agreement.
You know what that is, don't you?

373
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,929
You really think
I don't know what that is?

374
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,014
I'll explain it.

375
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,974
Oh, yeah. Go ahead, go ahead.

376
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,777
The Korean Government
needs to show interest

377
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,051
in attracting foreign capital.

378
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,272
Foreign capital has zero confidence
in Rhee Seungmin's government.

379
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,649
We need a new economic policy

380
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,444
if America's gonna have any faith in us.

381
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:56,948
Ah, so you're saying we do
what those Liberal Party jerks can't do?

382
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,576
That's it. That's exactly it!

383
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,453
You're finally understanding everything.

384
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,164
Oh, but wait.

385
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,500
In our party,
there's Yoon Bohyun's old faction

386
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,336
and Jang Min's new faction.

387
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,754
I'm aware of that.

388
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:15,175
We need to make sure that these policies
are initiated by the new faction.

389
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,468
Yes, we've got to.

390
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,764
That way, those of us in the new faction
will support you.

391
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,369
We're gonna need that whiskey
the Assemblyman's so fond of.

392
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,020
Yes, sir.

393
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,898
Look at us, finally on the same page, huh?

394
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,983
Right.

395
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,402
Hey, you know Kim San, right? Don't you?

396
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,071
Come over and say hello.

397
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:41,076
December 31, 1959
Seoul, South Korea

398
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,120
{\an8}US Army club

399
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,331
<i>♪ Oh, when the saints ♪</i>

400
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,500
<i>♪ Go marching in ♪</i>

401
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,543
<i>♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in ♪</i>

402
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,628
Hanmin!

403
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,879
- Kwangmin's here.
- Hey.

404
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,881
Hey, how did it go?

405
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,592
Economic Policy Committee chair.

406
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,595
- Sorry about last time.
- It's all right.

407
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,519
Congratulations.
You'll be an assemblyman, huh?

408
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,932
And now we drink.

409
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,517
- Here's to death.
- Cheers.

410
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,893
Cheers!

411
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,647
I'm gonna drink a lot tonight.

412
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,815
Hey, order another round.

413
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,942
- Let's just go for it.
- Five,

414
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:18,113
- four, three, two, one!
- Four, three, two, one!

415
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,699
Happy New Year!

416
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,003
Wow.

417
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,647
This feels like when we studied abroad.

418
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,173
Yeah, it does.

419
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,635
So don't you think
that with you in the Democratic Party,

420
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,761
it'll upset Yeojin?

421
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,098
I might not have made the right choice.

422
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,687
- San.
- Hmm?

423
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,148
Do you trust Uncle Samsik?

424
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,276
- Why?
- I'm not sure, I guess…

425
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,446
It's going so well, I'm getting nervous.

426
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,249
Hey!

427
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,086
Stand down! You will stand down.

428
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,588
On your stomach!

429
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,506
- On our stomach!
- Roll over.

430
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,676
- Kwangmin. What about Uncle Samsik…
- Turn everything in South Korea

431
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,761
upside down!

432
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,095
…is making you nervous?

433
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,680
- Upside down!
- Huh?

434
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,184
- Huh?
- Turn the whole thing upside down!

435
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,812
Hey, where…
where are you going?

436
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,189
Wait, stop. Stop right there.

437
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,982
Stop right there!

438
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,734
Sir!

439
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,031
{\an8}They look great.

440
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,992
{\an8}Now distribute these
around the Innovation Party locations.

441
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,786
Yes, sir. Let's go.

442
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,246
Here.

443
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,335
Have a good day.

444
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,214
{\an8}CHAIRMAN OF THE ECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEE
KIM SAN

445
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,016
{\an8}KIM SAN, DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S
ECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

446
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,824
Where're the others?

447
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,325
I can't reach anyone.

448
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,743
Tonight, Yoon Palbong…

449
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,412
finally goes down.

450
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,791
Do you want in on this?

451
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,713
I've wanted this for a very long time now.

452
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,929
All right.

453
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,891
<i>Is Cha Taemin prepared?</i>

454
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,060
- Yes.
- <i>What did he say?</i>

455
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,189
He says he wants to be sure
to kill Yoon Palbong himself.

456
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,900
<i>That's good.
Make it happen as soon as possible.</i>

457
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:01,985
Yes, sir.

458
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,579
What did Kang Seongmin say?

459
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,039
I told you to stop coming here.

460
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,725
You told him
about the Innovation Party, right?

461
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,585
We can't be seen together ever again.

462
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,836
God, what did he say?

463
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,088
That you did good.

464
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,010
You stay right next to Choo
and really embrace this spy role.

465
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,720
Did he mention having me killed?

466
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,804
What do you mean?

467
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,598
You're the key
to bringing down Choo Intae.

468
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,183
Look at you, Yoon Palbong. Huh?

469
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,978
You helped someone become
an assemblyman and saved his life.

470
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,023
I told you, do what I say
and you'll be fine. You see?

471
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,320
I should've known, Samsik.

472
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,822
You've got a great mind.

473
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,533
I got a lot of great things,
but especially a great mind.

474
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,080
Samsik, thank you. Thank you so much.

475
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,085
I'll go now.

476
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,004
Don't you ever come back here.

477
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,672
Right.

478
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,258
I'll never come back here. Ever.

479
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,947
What do you want? What now? Oh.

480
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,698
Uh…

481
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,867
Well, Mr. Kang.

482
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,746
I guess you were in the area.

483
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,500
That was Yoon Palbong, wasn't it?

484
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,002
When are you gonna have him killed?

485
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,632
My father gave you
a lot of bread back in the day.

486
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,636
You used to be so efficient.

487
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,720
But now…

488
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,475
you're so slow. Are you just getting old?

489
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,435
Or could it be…

490
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,815
you're hiding something from me?

491
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,029
You are, aren't you?

492
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,159
Tell me. It stays between us.

493
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,497
Yoon Palbong has…
just joined the Innovation Party.

494
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,207
His reason?

495
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,252
He thought if he were next to Choo Intae,
he'd be safer.

496
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,503
That's good.

497
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,796
What?

498
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,881
We can kill Choo Intae while we're at it.

499
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,928
Sir, don't… don't say that.

500
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,692
I'm the one who chooses the target,

501
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,486
and you find the means.

502
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:53,990
I'm joking.

503
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,119
Killing Choo at the wrong time
would be catastrophic.

504
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,416
I want you to take care of it, Uncle.

505
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,710
Properly.

506
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,587
Yes, sir.

507
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,224
Yeojin,

508
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,061
why does your dad want to become
the president?

509
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,771
Is it good to be president?

510
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,358
Well, he doesn't want to become president
because it's good, that's not it.

511
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,738
He just wants to create a world

512
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,033
where you can do or be anything
that you dream of when you grow up.

513
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,618
That's why he wants to do it.

514
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,166
- Yeojin.
- Uncle San.

515
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,794
Yeojin's been waiting here
for you forever.

516
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,257
What brings you all this way?

517
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,177
I hadn't heard from you
in a few days.

518
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,430
I've been a little busy.

519
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,143
My father keeps getting approached
by people who just want to flatter him.

520
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,187
He just hears what he wants to hear.

521
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,065
And I'm afraid
my father will change who he is.

522
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,152
Are there no other options?

523
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,967
If we join with the Democratic Party,
it could make it easier.

524
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,327
No. The Democratic Party's
in no position for that.

525
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,006
Well, would you know
anybody who works there?

526
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,045
I like seeing you this way.

527
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,430
Choo Intae!

528
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,933
- Choo Intae!
- Go away!

529
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,519
- Choo Intae!
- The Democratic Party!

530
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,104
What's going on?

531
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,815
What do you think
you're doing? Stop! Stop!

532
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,276
The country needs the Democratic Party!

533
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,362
Choo Intae!

534
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,072
Who wants to challenge us?

535
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,782
Choo Intae!

536
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,577
{\an8}KIM SAN, DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S
ECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

537
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:08,541
Choo Intae!

538
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,544
- All right, gentlemen.
- It is what it is.

539
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,648
It's just policy research...

540
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,066
At the Democratic Party?

541
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,196
Have you joined them?

542
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,532
I can't get into the details
at the moment, but…

543
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,911
in my position…

544
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,747
I'm not able to explain myself.

545
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,831
I guess I always knew…

546
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,252
this day would come eventually.

547
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,883
I understand.

548
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,897
Choo Intae as president
Politics for the people

549
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,483
Innovation is the only way forward!

550
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,526
Innovation is the only way forward!

551
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,738
Peaceful unification
is the only way forward!

552
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,115
Peaceful unification
is the only way forward!

553
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,035
We cannot live this way!
Let's make changes.

554
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,829
We cannot live this way!
Voting for change!

555
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,874
Choo Intae!

556
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,919
Thank you all! Thank you!

557
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,965
Choo Intae!

558
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:43,010
- Choo Intae!
- Choo Intae!

559
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,180
Now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Mister Choo Intae's daughter!

560
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,017
- Choo Yeojin!
- Choo Yeojin!

561
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:55,606
Choo Yeojin!

562
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,692
- Let's go.
- Choo Yeojin!

563
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:02,905
Choo Yeojin!

564
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,417
So, what did you discuss with my father?

565
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,461
He wants me to join the Innovation Party.

566
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,671
Did you give him an answer?

567
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,340
Well,

568
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,634
I said I'd think about it.

569
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,386
Should we postpone our wedding?

570
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,098
Do you think there might be
a position for me in the Innovation Party?

571
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,267
So you want to get into politics?

572
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,868
Does this mean you're joining the party?

573
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,896
I'm thinking about it.

574
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,297
There's really no need to force it.

575
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,028
My father keeps getting approached
by people who just want to flatter him.

576
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,614
And I'm afraid
my father will change who he is.

577
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,866
Are there no other options?

578
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,344
If we join with the Democratic Party,
it could make it easier.

579
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,787
No. The Democratic Party's
in no position for that.

580
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,964
Well, would you know
anybody who works there?

581
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,752
I like seeing you this way.

582
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,047
Jina likes this one, doesn't she?

583
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,107
Oh, you don't have to do that for Jina.

584
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,801
Uh, I think
this is the one she likes, right?

585
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,346
Oh, it's this one.

586
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,473
- Can we have a bag of these here?
- Oh, sure.

587
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,807
I'd prefer it…

588
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,977
if you stayed out of politics, actually.

589
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,648
Is that selfish to ask?

590
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,907
Choo Yeojin!

591
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,869
Choo Yeojin!

592
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:47,468
Choo Intae!

593
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,677
Thank you!

594
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,180
Choo Intae!

595
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,824
Choo Intae!

596
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,993
Choo Intae!

597
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,081
Choo Intae!

598
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,250
Thank you, everyone!

599
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,001
Thank you!

600
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,253
Choo Intae!

601
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,090
Innovation is the only way forward!

602
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,343
I will be with you until the very end!

603
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,265
Please excuse me. Yeojin.

604
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:38,269
We will win the election
and make lasting changes.

605
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,358
Why are you here?

606
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,776
Sorry for intruding like this.

607
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,112
Can you please give me a moment?

608
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
We'll do this later.

609
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,581
What is it?

610
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,002
I intend to do whatever it takes
to support Mister Choo Intae.

611
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,256
And being with the Democratic Party
won't change that.

612
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,200
Is that what you came here to say?

613
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,760
I admire and support Mister Choo Intae.

614
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,095
So can you go out there

615
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,348
and declare
that you're Choo Intae's son-in-law?

616
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,477
Can you say
that you support the Innovation Party?

617
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,479
That you're done
with the Democratic Party?

618
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,441
Yes, of course.

619
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,068
Of course.

620
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,945
Yeojin.

621
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,240
I love you very much
and I'm sure you know that.

622
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,038
I have this dream.

623
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,248
What dream is that?

624
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,711
There's a version of South Korea…

625
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,297
that I want to create.

626
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,468
Except that's not a real dream.

627
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,596
That's hypocrisy.

628
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,184
Hypocrisy dressed as a dream.

629
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,985
Let's bring change.

630
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,865
Choo Intae!

631
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,702
Yeah! You get that area!

632
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,379
Hey, you sons of bitches!

633
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,340
Yeojin!

634
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,008
Yeojin!

635
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,428
Why are you doing this?

636
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,513
Yeojin!

637
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,647
Yeojin!
