1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,342
I was an Albright scholar
at an American University.

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,262
During my time in America,

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,016
there was beauty and abundance
everywhere I'd look.

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,060
Meanwhile, my countrymen
were stripped bare and starving.

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,189
Do you know what pizza is?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,983
Has anyone tried it?

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,985
Mr. Pak, have you tried it, sir?

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,904
No, I haven't, boy.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,658
During my time abroad,
I lived above a pizza shop

10
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,161
and couldn't afford
a single proper meal a day.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,914
Every day, I smelled pizzas baking.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,876
Every night, it kept me up.

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,419
Was it really that good?

14
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,925
Listen, the economy
matters more than guns.

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,804
I saw a country
where no one worried about food.

16
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,057
Where you can have
three decent meals every day.

17
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,185
What I envied during my studies abroad

18
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,604
wasn't their fighter jets
or aircraft carriers, it was…

19
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,355
it was pizza.

20
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,608
What is the point

21
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,110
of winning a war

22
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,821
when the entire nation
is starving to death?

23
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,949
That's why Mr. Choo Intae said

24
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,993
that I should study economics.

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,038
The Republic of Korea…

26
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,294
can use its young and abundant work force
to become an industrialized nation.

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,299
With our peninsular position,
we could become the next center of trade.

28
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,053
That is exactly the kind of nation…

29
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,640
that Mr. Choo Intae dreams of.

30
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,649
Choo Intae!

31
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,568
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

32
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,947
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,325
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

34
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,035
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,496
UNCLE SAMSIK

36
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:59,012
UNCLE SAMSIK

37
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,058
SAME DREAM

38
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,816
Thank you.

39
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,444
Oh wow, that was a great speech, huh?

40
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,488
Yeah, I'll bet you'll make
a great addition to the Democratic Party.

41
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,617
-Indeed. I found your speech touching.
-Is your boyfriend looking…

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,285
- We could set up a meeting.
- …to get into politics?

43
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,121
- Yes, exactly, exactly!
- Not at all.

44
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,123
You'll be the Democratic Party's
greatest asset.

45
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,042
That is, if you want to join us.

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,501
- So you must join us!
- Yeah!

47
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,003
We'd be glad to have you.

48
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,504
-Of course.
-San.

49
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,673
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

50
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,092
Assemblyman Sun, we will be in touch.

51
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,969
Oh, right. Sure.

52
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,596
Of course, of course.

53
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,681
Have a good evening, sir. Bye.

54
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,268
Wow, amazing speech, don't you think?

55
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,860
{\an8}Will your father be okay?

56
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,905
{\an8}I'm gonna go find him right now.

57
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,907
{\an8}I'll come with you.

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,909
{\an8}No, it's okay. I'll talk to you later.

59
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,298
{\an8}Oh, no!

60
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,467
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, oh my goodness.

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,302
Thank you. Oh, gosh.

62
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,971
- Oh, it's okay.
- Your clothes are all dirty now.

63
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,555
-I'm terribly sorry about that.
-You're not hurt, are you?

64
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,599
- Oh, no. Goodness. Thank you.
- Sir, could you give us a hand?

65
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,524
- There you go.
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.

66
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,692
We can take it from here now.

67
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,902
-I'm sorry about the fruit.
-That's fine. Thank you. Thank you.

68
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,363
- Please be careful.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you.

69
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,700
Thank you.

70
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,042
Thank you for that.

71
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,920
I see you've got great potential.

72
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,005
Sorry?

73
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,424
You know what pizza tastes like.

74
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,260
Have you really had it before?

75
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,347
Yes.

76
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,850
I found your speech very impressive.

77
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,396
Especially "a country where you can have
three meals a day."

78
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,441
Yeah, that part
really brought tears to my eyes.

79
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,900
I appreciate it.

80
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,654
I hope to see you
some time again very soon.

81

SEOHAE OIL, SAIL DEVELOPMENTS
CEO PAK DOOCHILL

82
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,176
Watch it, man!

83
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,970
Hello.

84
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,389
We won.

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,850
-Oh, you won?
-Yes.

86
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,227
-You saw us destroy 25 men.
-We only had 10 guys.

87
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,146
It doesn't matter
that you only had 10 guys.

88
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,523
I would've hired more men
with the money I gave you

89
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,816
and forgotten the rest.

90
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,942
And Yoon Palbong?

91
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,072
-He ran away.
-Yoon Palbong was your target.

92
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,948
Either way, well done.

93
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,618
He and his men will retaliate,
so be prepared.

94
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,828
- Yes, sir.
- Have a good night.

DECEMBER 1, 1959
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

96
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,842
{\an8}MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS

97
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,303
Hey, kid.

98
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,306
I'll take a paper.

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,901
Wow, he's on the front page.

100
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,403
He's a star.

101
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,487
What are you doing?

102
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,323
Good morning.

103
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,242
Don't bother hiding it.

104
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,828
I've seen it all too.

105
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,663
It was a great photo of you.

106
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,634
Moving forward,

107
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,344
you'll be working with the Audit Bureau.

108
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,762
The Audit Bureau?

109
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,807
The minister requested
that you be transferred.

110
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,769
Could it be
because of that speech last night?

111
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,896
You just had to go there, huh?

112
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,900
Sir, listen. I've spent my life
researching and analyzing this project.

113
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,737
The National Reconstruction Bureau
brought me to Home Affairs.

114
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,905
If that's really the case,

115
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,491
then you should've been more careful.

116
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,165
I refuse to leave like this.

117
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,791
I'll meet with the minister myself.

118
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,585
Hey, are you insane?

119
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,170
The minister is not your friend. Hey!

120
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,839
I will meet with the minister
and beg on my knees if I have to.

121
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,299
-Listen to me. Listen.
-I can't just--

122
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,301
-Hey!
-I'll handle this myself.

123
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,011
Wait!

124
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,137
Take a look at it.

125
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,847
Minister Choi.

126
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,059
Sir, I need to speak with you.

127
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,022
This man looks familiar.

128
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,775
Didn't you read today's paper?

129
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,570
Comprehensive economic policy for
the 5-year National Reconstruction Plan

130
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,863
So you're famous now?

131
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,662
Who is that?

132
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,999
Liberal Party Assemblyman,
Kang Seongmin.

133
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,418
Why is the Liberal Party
walking off with our proposal?

134
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,216
YEAR 1960

Capital Defense Unit, Secret Bunker

136
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,178
That day…

137
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,891
I met Liberal Party member Kang Seongmin
for the first time.

138
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,814
He was carrying a copy of the proposal
I had worked on for over two years.

139
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,691
- The National Reconstruction Proposal?
- Yes.

140
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,152
It was obvious
Minister Choi Minkyu gave it to him.

141
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,487
But the thing is…

142
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,575
I still can't forget
the look in the man's eyes.

143
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,788
That condescending…

144
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,958
disdainful look.

145
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,964
As if all he wanted to do
was tear me apart.

146
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,717
Oh, so you're famous now?

147
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,931
And that I can't forget.

148
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,649
{\an8}ARMY COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS

149
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,994
Commander. Sir.

150
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,841
HONG YOUNGKI
HEAD OF THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS

151
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,635
- What? What's going on?
- There they are!

152
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,971
-Hey, run!
-Get them! Get them!

153
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,357
I left the Ministry of Home Affairs
not knowing what was next for me.

154
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,322
<i>I just wandered the streets
for the rest of the day.</i>

155
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,201
I was angry. I felt defeated.

156
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,747
I had nowhere to go and no one to tell.

157
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,417
<i>I felt so lost.</i>

158
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,630
Fucking dogs.

159
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,884
I felt like no one wanted to listen
to what I had to say.

160
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,054
It seemed like nobody even cared
about the future of South Korea.

161
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,643
"Would I go back to America?"

162
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,320
"Just go teach somewhere?

163
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,656
Or go into business
and be a complete sell-out?"

164
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,203
Damn it.

165
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,122
Ah, shit.

166
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,043
Just how far
are you guys gonna run, assholes?

167
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,382
-Look behind you.
-What?

168
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,467
I said look behind you, now!

169
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,513
We've got you now, asshole.

170
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,264
Bring it on.

171
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,658
You son of a bitch.

172
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,669
And then…

173
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,468
…Uncle Samsik showed up again.

174
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,186
Can I help you?

175
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,232
You remember my boss, right?

176
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,653
Yes.

177
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,197
He's waiting for you right now.

178
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,887
-I'm glad you could make it.
-What's this about?

179
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,305
Please, have a seat.

180
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,605
I enjoyed reading
the National Reconstruction Proposal.

181
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,773
How'd you get a copy?

182
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,108
I get anything I want from Home Affairs.

183
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,238
I always dreamed

184
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,742
of eating a red bean bun.
So much so that…

185
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,828
that at 16…

186
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,417
I killed a person for the first time.

187
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,879
But now I eat as many as I want.

188
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,298
I bought this little bakery.

189
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,175
So what's the point of telling me this?

190
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,262
The point is that…

191
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,183
I tend to get…

192
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,103
everything I want from people.

193
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,233
I happen to have a special skill.

194
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,736
I can tell just by looking
into someone's eyes

195
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,238
whether they'll make it or not.

196
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,447
You, Manager Kim,

197
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,201
have potential to become president.

198
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,496
Well, at least minister, for sure.

199
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,791
-Yeah, maybe I'll call you Minister.
-Sure.

200
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,669
I can see it with my own eyes.

201
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,629
You've got strong ambition.

202
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,048
We met
for the first time yesterday, right?

203
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,216
Yes.

204
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,010
And what a fateful encounter it was.

205
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,389
Minister, do you know
the principles that govern this world?

206
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,310
Spring arrives, then summer.
Flowers bloom, then wilt.

207
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,480
They're what make the world go around,
the sun rise and set.

208
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,149
Are you referencing
the rotation of the Earth?

209
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,194
That's right.
The Earth's rotation and revolution.

210
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,447
Can you feel it right now?
The rotation and revolution?

211
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,620
Yeah.

212
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,875
That is precisely the kind of man I am.

213
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,836
The Earth's rotation and revolution.

214
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,506
Minister, we're both dreaming
the same dream.

215
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,592
But why me?

216
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,595
There's a lot of qualified people
out there.

217
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,055
Those kinds of people
aren't prepared to do

218
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,391
what needs to be done
in order to help others.

219
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,272
You said you read the proposal I wrote?

220
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,317
How long would it take to get it running?

221
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,236
We at least need to foster talent

222
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,947
and complete the industrial complex
in five years

223
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,074
to establish an export-led industry
within 10 years.

224
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,868
Five years, seven at most. If we don't…

225
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,204
other countries will leave us behind.

226
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,499
That's the dream that I have.

227
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,253
Can you make this happen?

228
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,338
I knew it.

229
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,883
How is it that you and I think
so much alike?

230
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,260
Can you make it work?
Give me a straight answer here.

231
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
A straight answer?

232
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,848
I've got a straight answer for you.

233
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,767
What is it?

234
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,145
Stop seeing Choo Yeojin.

235
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
What'd you say?

236
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,983
You and Choo Intae's daughter
can't be dating.

237
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,908
You don't even know me, all right?
That's crossing the line.

238
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,495
You said we both had the same dream.

239
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,663
Exactly right.

240
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,541
And if you're Choo Intae's son-in-law,
the dream will never be fulfilled.

241
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,965
Have you had pizza?

242
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,552
Yes, of course.

243
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,179
What's pizza taste like?

244
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
What?

245
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,392
Taste?

246
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,936
How do you even explain taste with words?

247
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,938
What does it taste like?

248
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,483
It's something that can't be explained.

249
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,445
Sounds like you don't know
what it tastes like.

250
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,326
So then,

251
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,620
did you break up with Choo Yeojin?

252
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,127
Hmm. No, I didn't.

253
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,630
Then, when was it
that you saw Samsik again?

254
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,756
After that night…

255
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,137
he visited me every single day.

256
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,601
<i>President Rhee began
his day by greeting various visitors.</i>

257
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,188
<i>First to arrive were key figures
in the legislation,</i>

258
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,399
<i>the judiciary, and the administration.</i>

259
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,818
<i>He urged the government and the people</i>

260
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,864
<i>to work together in the coming year
toward a better future for South Korea.</i>

261
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,920
I'll be there when he announces.

262
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,133
Are you sure you'll be okay?

263
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,928
I'll be fine.

264
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,723
They drove you to the Audit Bureau
because of your speech, didn't they?

265
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,560
Sure, but the Audit Bureau…
could be interesting.

266
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,859
Just a minute, Yeojin.

267
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,985
Excuse me.

268
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,905
Yes?

269
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,615
Why are you following us?

270
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,825
Me? No. I wasn't.

271
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,702
Yeah, you have been since the theater.

272
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,246
- Why are you following us?
- You're mistaken.

273
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,041
Did Uncle Samsik put you up to this?

274
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,125
Yes.

275
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,967
What's that?
Who on Earth left this here?

276
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,178
Mom, Uncle Samsik? Who's that?

277
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,389
Soojin.

278
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,392
Is there an "Uncle Samsik"
in our neighborhood?

279
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,520
Uncle Samsik?

280
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,855
I've never heard of him.

281
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,608
Someone left us these bags of rice.

282
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,235
Rice?

283
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm home.

284
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,072
Uncle.

285
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,157
Who's Uncle Samsik?

286
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,325
Hmm?

287
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,868
Hey, where'd this come from?

288
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,287
Do you think it's all right
if we keep this though?

289
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,214
I know who this is from,
so we can keep it.

290
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,845
Jina, I'm gonna make some for you.

291
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,101
Oh, my.
It's pretty chilly today.

292
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,770
This is for your niece.

293
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,524
How did you know we were out of rice?

294
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,193
Well, I could hear your stomach growling
from miles away.

295
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,739
Yeojin and I are gonna keep dating.

296
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,824
So you can leave.

297
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,619
Choo Intae. Isn't that guy a communist?

298
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,497
No, and I wouldn't break up with her
even if her father was a communist.

299
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,833
Why ruin the big picture
with something trivial?

300
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,210
So you think our love is trivial?

301
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,005
Guess you don't know much about love.

302
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,089
Love, huh?

303
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,425
There's a lot of women,
but opportunities are rare.

304
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,677
Opportunities, huh?

305
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,347
I have a great plan in mind.
One that's just for you, Minister.

306
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,935
So what is this plan of yours?

307
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,481
That'll all be revealed to you
when you're ready to receive it.

308
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,609
Here, share these with your niece.

309
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,569
A full stomach tends to open one's mind.

310
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,489
Pick Choo Intae and I promise you,

311
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,116
you'll be hungry forever.

312
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,118
No… Wait a second.

313
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,545
When your stomach's full,
your mind really does tend to open.

314
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,838
He was right about that.

315
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,051
I'd never had such delicious
rice or snacks in my whole life.

316
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,931
And the reality in this country was…

317
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,437
you couldn't afford those things
with the salary of a Home Affairs manager.

318
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,317
DECEMBER 15, 1959
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

319
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,653
{\an8}INNOVATION PARTY

320
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,448
Ah, goodness.

321
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,243
-Must be a lot of work for you, huh?
-Not at all.

322
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,078
-It's good to see you again.
-Of course.

323
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,121
-Have a seat inside.
-All right, keep up the good work.

324
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,207
- Congratulations.
- Have you set a date?

325
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,417
We will, after the election.

326
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,170
- You're doing such great work.
- Thank you.

327
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,465
Just gonna be a housewife
after you're married?

328
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,883
Hmm?

329
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,885
Top of your class in Korean literature.

330
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,679
Come to Aemin Daily with us.

331
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,765
You're here.

332
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,558
How is everything? Where's your father?

333
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,354
Oh Inwoo. Reporter for Aemin Daily
and classmate of Yeojin.

334
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,315
I'm Kim San.

335
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,068
Looks like you've come down here
to celebrate, huh?

336
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,486
- You doing all right?
- Of course.

337
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,030
So you're joining the Democratic Party.

338
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,448
-It's been a while.
-Indeed.

339
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,741
- I'll see you again soon.
- Yes, sir.

340
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,868
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

341
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,372
{\an8}SEONYOOWON

342
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,718
The foreign press is saying
there's no way we can win.

343
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,012
The opposition party's
influence is too strong

344
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,346
in the major cities right now.

345
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,724
What do we do about it?

346
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,892
Increase voter turnout in the provinces.

347
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,519
So how will you achieve that?

348
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,895
Campaign and encourage voting.

349
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,439
That's about all we can do, right?

350
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,525
You won't get anywhere with that attitude.

351
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,485
You're the future party leader.

352
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,279
If you have something in mind,

353
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,823
then let me hear it.

354
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,411
Amend the Local Government Act,

355
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,373
so we can mobilize
local government workers for the campaign.

356
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,586
That's abuse of power and it'll lead
to resistance from the opposition.

357
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,630
Some people will be against it
even within the party. It'll get tense.

358
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,717
Will you be able to handle
something like that?

359
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,178
You know that politics…

360
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,097
is all about beating those against you
and getting them to join you.

361
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,016
It's a chance
to take control of the party.

362
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,810
Perhaps it is.

363
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,187
As you prefer.

364
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,314
I guess I didn't see the big picture.

365
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:51,536
Well, I had no intention of participating
in real politics until now.

366
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,830
But for the sake of the people's desire

367
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:59,127
to prevent the current administration
from regaining power and strength,

368
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,297
I intend to run
in the next presidential election.

369
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,438
Democracy this, democracy that,
we're always busy talking about it,

370
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,732
but we don't know what it actually is.

371
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,943
I'm a novice when it comes to politics.

372
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,194
You're young.

373
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,865
You have time to face the…
the obstacles of reality,

374
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,784
because you're young.

375
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,954
Well, I'm honored, sir.

376
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,039
But I'd like to think about it,
if that's all right.

377
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,505
So what did you discuss with my father?

378
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,716
He wants me to join the Innovation Party.

379
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,010
Did you give him an answer?

380
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,806
Well,

381
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,975
I said I'd think about it.

382
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,562
-Should we postpone our wedding?
-Hmm?

383
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,898
Just a minute, okay?

384
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,235
- Good evening.
- Oh, welcome.

385
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,237
-Can I please have a basket?
-Oh, sure.

386
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,824
Jina likes this one, doesn't she?

387
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,659
Oh, you don't have to do that for Jina.

388
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,412
Uh, I think this is
the one she likes, right?

389
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,039
Uh, it's this one.

390
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,167
- Can we have a bag of these here?
- Oh, sure.

391
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,170
I'd prefer it

392
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,131
if you stayed out of politics, actually.

393
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,927
Is that selfish to ask?

394
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,346
No, it isn't.

395
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,809
-Yes, how much is it?
-Thank you so much.

396
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,186
It's 300 hwan.

397
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,521
It's okay. Let me buy this for Jina.

398
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,526
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you. Enjoy.

399
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,031
DECEMBER 16, 1959
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

400
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,325
{\an8}NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

401
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,701
Good afternoon.

402
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,786
How have you been?

403
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,749
Why did you call me here?

404
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,043
The president is announcing
his candidacy very soon.

405
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,920
The entire world knows that.

406
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,213
Well, what they don't know yet

407
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,674
is he'll be appointing me
as the chairman of the election committee.

408
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,969
We need your influence, Mr. Pak.

409
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,350
And what influence do you think I have?

410
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,523
Don't you control the police?

411
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,485
We need some men
to secretly work for us in the outskirts.

412
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,697
The president must have given him
the chair position for a reason, right?

413
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,874
So what do you need?

414
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,579
The mighty Yoon Palbong…

415
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,290
…taken down by some underling.

416
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,042
Are you serious? If I could've faced
those punks one-on-one,

417
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,044
they'd be dead right now.

418
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,046
You're done with street fights.

419
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,550
We're now in an age
of fighter planes and submarines.

420
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,510
Did you come to make me angry?

421
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:49,232
Kang Seongmin has just put out a hit
on a certain Yoon Palbong.

422
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,949
You're here to kill me?

423
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,162
Oh, I'm here to save Yoon Palbong.

424
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,709
All right. Well then…

425
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,171
tell me what I've got to do.

426
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,799
You gotta win
the Innovation Party's nomination.

427
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,426
The Innovation?

428
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,219
Choo Intae?

429
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,597
But I don't like Choo Intae.

430
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,891
The safest spot's right next to Choo.

431
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,185
Tell Kang you'll get nominated

432
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,021
and you'll spy on Choo Intae
for him from the inside.

433
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,399
He would never kill someone
if he finds them useful.

434
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,986
Hey, how am I supposed to get nominated?

435
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,321
There's always a way.

436
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,823
There's a string attached.

437
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,495
- Come on in.
- Yes, sir.

438
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,414
Hello.

439
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,210
Are you feeling okay?

440
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,420
Hand Dongdaemun over to these guys.

441
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,757
Thanks for your understanding.

442
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,307
{\an8}BANYA HOTEL

443
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,603
Here he comes.
I'll… I'll head inside first.

444
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,729
This way.

445
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,855
Shall we?

446
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,945
What happened with Yoon Palbong?

447
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,739
I will tell you when we're finished here.

448
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,828
KANG SEONGMIN

449
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,247
CHEONGWOO FEDERATION
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

450
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,293
I will be chairing
the election campaign committee

451
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,129
in order to secure
the president's reelection.

452
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,048
Are we certain that he's gonna run?

453
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,175
Yes, the announcement will be made soon.

454
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,886
The Development Bank is giving us
a loan to invest

455
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,389
in the industrial complex facilities
and 30%

456
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,474
will be used to fund the campaign.

457
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,019
What? 30%?
That's out of the question.

458
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,354
Utterly ridiculous.

459
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,814
We cannot accept that--

460
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,819
Think about this.
If our partners were to pull out,

461
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,364
we lose what we've invested.

462
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,700
So what do you say?

463
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,286
It's not feasible for us.

464
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,954
That's way too much, 30%.

465
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,539
We're talking about a debt here.

466
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,458
And for you to use 30% of the loan?

467
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,835
Once I become
the chair of the election campaign,

468
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,212
I will make sure
that our Cheongwoo Federation

469
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,964
takes control of the Liberal Party.

470
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,424
Then we can push for special laws

471
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,801
and see that the industrial complex
is completed.

472
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,513
Lend me your support
and put your trust in me.

473
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,768
Now applaud!

474
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,073
30%, that's totally ridiculous.

475
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,769
Is there really a need
to kill Yoon Palbong right away?

476
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,687
You'll need him for the next election.

477
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,772
I don't need him.

478
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,737
It's not easy these days
to find people to do the dirty work.

479
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,371
I told you, I keep having nightmares.

480
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,251
I'm gonna need some time then.

481
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,880
What's Cha Taemin up to?

482
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:42,966
Taemin?

483
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,595
Well, Taemin, I assume

484
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,807
is at the salt farms
regretting what he did.

485
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,810
Give it to Taemin.

486
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,105
That's a little…

487
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,815
What?

488
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,441
Does that make you uneasy?

489
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,113
Should we just throw you to the fish, or…

490
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,490
should we work together?

491
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,658
Cha Taemin
Leader of the Sineui Alliance

492
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,327
No, it does not.

493
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,454
I will arrange to meet with him.

494
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,332
I'm sure he's got a grudge
against Yoon Palbong.

495
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,461
Tell him I'll send him to Osaka
if he gets the job done right.

496
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,505
Yes.

497
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,465
Do this for me

498
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,926
as quickly as possible.

499
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,979
The Sineui Alliance is worthless.

500
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,399
It's a puppet exploited by your ambitions.

501
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,443
Why should we…

502
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,696
Why should we kill people for you?

503
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,406
Is that why you betrayed me?

504
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,284
<i>So please,
just let Taemin live.</i>

505
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,996
I'll send him off to the salt farms
and keep a close eye on him.

506
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,253
Call the salt farm.

507
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,297
Tell them I'm coming.

508
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,132
Very well, sir.

509
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,314
What's going on here?

510
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,982
- Well…
- Huh?

511
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,277
The Reconstruction Bureau
is being shut down.

512
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,987
Wait, what are you saying?

513
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,489
It's the minister's order.

514
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,702
What now?

515
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,831
What exactly is going on?

516
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,417
Well, we have an election to handle.

517
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,338
Would you just tell me what this is about?

518
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,257
What's going on?

519
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,844
Tell me why.

520
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,140
You and I spent
all those sleepless nights, didn't we?

521
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,267
You missed your children's graduations.

522
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,186
And you put up with delayed payments.

523
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,899
You even rejected decent job offers.

524
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,777
For what?

525
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,570
Tell me, sir.

526
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,824
There were dreams, weren't there?

527
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,577
Dreams that we were planning
on fulfilling, you and I.

528
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,287
Right?

529
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,081
I hear what you're saying.

530
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,333
And I feel the same way.

531
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,796
So then why are they doing this
all of a sudden?

532
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,966
He says that a planned economy
is for communists.

533
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,342
That's complete nonsense.

534
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,513
Each department will send employees
to the election headquarters.

535
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,766
They're using government workers
for the election?

536
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,977
Every non-essential department
is getting disbanded

537
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,395
to focus on the election.

538
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,069
Sir.

539
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,195
Yes?

540
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,865
What have you been doing this whole time?

541
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,119
Were you planning on just riding
our coattails until you got promoted?

542
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,704
Kim San.

543
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,540
How… how dare you?

544
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,001
I owe you nothing from this point on.

545
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,888
The National Reconstruction Project.

546
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,516
I'm not gonna give it up.

547
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,602
-What?
-I will continue working

548
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,479
on the National Reconstruction Project.

549
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,483
So set the materials aside.

550
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,044
What did Samsik propose to you
when you first met him?

551
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,550
<i>He reached out to me
as soon as I left the Ministry.</i>

552
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,097
<i>It turns out
he had been watching me all along.</i>

553
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,517
<i>He also knew
that the National Reconstruction Bureau</i>

554
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,894
<i>had been disbanded.</i>

555
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,190
Mom, is this really gonna work?

556
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,400
I guess we'll see.

557
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,777
Hi, I'm home.

558
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,071
Oh, Uncle, someone sent us a telephone.

559
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,656
A telephone?

560
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,077
Who sent this?

561
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,121
Uh, some people came
to drop it off earlier today.

562
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,673
- Yes, hello?
<i>- Hello, Minister.</i>

563
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,174
Can you hear me all right?

564
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,887
I sent you a telephone,
so that we could chat every now and then.

565
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,722
<i>It's great to hear your voice.</i>

566
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,015
What do you think you're doing?

567
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,559
<i>Minister, I heard they shut down</i>

568
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,352
<i>the National Reconstruction Bureau.</i>

569
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,355
Those poor fools,
they just don't understand.

570
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,232
They don't see what a blessing you are.

571
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,026
In my opinion,

572
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,572
blessings are only blessings if and when
they're placed in the right hands.

573
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,324
For those who are unable
to appreciate them,

574
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,784
they become poison.

575
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,162
And the poison spreads.

576
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,206
<i>I'm confident
that I can make very good use</i>

577
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,250
of the blessing that is Kim San.

578
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,962
Don't defy what's in your destiny.

579
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,843
<i>He told me
not to defy what's in my destiny.</i>

580
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,222
<i>Uncle Samsik is the kind of man
who can forge destiny out of thin air.</i>

581
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,019
<i>So, where was I destined to go next?</i>

582
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,980
<i>Well, of course,</i>

583
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,565
<i>he had the answer to that.</i>

584
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,152
<i>He knew it wasn't
to the place that needed me,</i>

585
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,739
<i>but to the place I needed to be.</i>

586
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,921
Hey, what are you doing here?

587
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,008
Just passing by and wanted to see you.

588
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,429
Can you wait a second?

589
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,889
I'll tell Father that you're here.

590
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,265
Oh, don't.

591
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,060
I came here to see you.

592
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,398
Well then, can you sit down
and wait a little while?

593
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,003
Yeojin, about that speech
scheduled for this weekend.

594
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,340
I think we need to cancel.
We have no campaign vehicles.

595
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,134
Let's wait a little longer.

596
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,638
<i>The place I needed to be.</i>

597
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,225
<i>But where did I have to be
for my own sake?</i>

598
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,698
The foreign press is predicting
Choo Intae will win the election.

599
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,867
Should we just trust
Kang Seongmin and leave it up to him?

600
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,035
No, we can't.

601
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,371
So?

602
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,833
What's the other option?

603
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,418
Well…

604
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,754
I have a great plan for us.

605
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,882
The Cheongwoo Federation will eventually
control the entire country.

606
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,303
So how do we do that?

607
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:29,265
We plan the establishment of a parliament

608
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,311
and we buy off
the entire National Assembly.

609
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,859
Was Samsik involved
in the illegal loan acquired

610
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,569
from the Development Bank?

611
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm not sure about that.

612
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,210
Was Samsik involved

613
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,505
in the election fraud
that took place on March 15th?

614
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,799
I'm not sure about that.

615
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,178
You want the ballot boxes…

616
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,346
Too risky?

617
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,014
You're stealing ballot boxes, aren't you?

618
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,557
You better not be caught this time around.

619
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,184
<i>If it seems even a little dangerous,</i>

620
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,894
<i>leave the ballot boxes
and get out of there.</i>

621
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,645
If you're caught this time,
I can't save you.

622
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,897
Did Samsik

623
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,733
coax and win over key figures

624
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,569
in the military and the government?

625
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,657
I'm not sure about that.

626
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,951
Go and meet Hong Youngki.

627
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,330
<i>Politics.</i>

628
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,791
<i>That's what poisoned the military.
Don't you see it?</i>

629
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,127
<i>The government turned the military
into its puppet.</i>

630
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,297
<i>We need to reform politics
to cleanse the military and if not,</i>

631
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,300
then the military has to cleanse politics.

632
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,844
Was Samsik the one…

633
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,556
who planned coup d'état?

634
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,352
<i>Let's turn the world upside down.</i>

635
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,647
<i>South Korea is too small
of a vessel for us.</i>

636
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,401
<i>A bowl too small
to hold our great potential.</i>

637
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,069
<i>We need to shatter it first</i>

638
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,196
<i>in order to create a bigger one.</i>
