1
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,015
Samsik, aged 16

2
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,683
Hey, Kang Ilsik.

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,351
Kang Ilsik
Kang Seongmin's father

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,603
Did you contact Osaka directly?

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,064
And who said that?

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,151
What are you doing?

7
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,799
Samsik.

8
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,384
Yes?

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,764
You like red bean buns, right?

10
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,766
If you…

11
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,560
do me a favor,

12
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,730
you can have as many as you want.

13
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,220
Uncle Samsik

14
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,445
Uncle Samsik

15
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:02,575
Win Over

16
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,582
Capital Defense Unit, Secret Bunker

17
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,624
Hanmin.

18
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,961
San, is that you?

19
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,130
You're here too?

20
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,383
San, you gotta tell them.

21
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,219
We didn't plan any of this!

22
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,762
This was all Samsik, not us!

23
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,140
San! Tell them, please!

24
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,350
Tell them it was all Samsik!

25
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
San!

26
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,270
Tell them, San!

27
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,023
San!

28
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,625
Captain Lee.

29
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,962
Been a while, Hanmin.

30
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,758
Jeong Hanmin, Lieutenant Colonel
of the Capital Defense Unit

31
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,509
The 55th Howitzer Regiment.

32
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,307
So I guess you're…

33
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,394
with the Second Operations
Commander now, hm?

34
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,645
We ask the questions here.

35
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,022
Lee Sooil
Captain of the 55th Howitzer Regiment

36
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,525
It seems there's been a misunderstanding.

37
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,237
I need to call General Jang Doosik.

38
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,822
Questions, requests…

39
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,824
They're off the table here.

40
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,578
Samsik is here, isn't he?

41
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,165
Where is Samsik?

42
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,167
Tell him to get in here!

43
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,710
Where is he?

44
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,106
Jeong Hanmin.

45
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,775
All you gotta do is answer.

46
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,571
Did Samsik plan this on his own?

47
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,702
How many times I gotta tell you, huh?

48
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,971
If you don't fess up soon, Hanmin,

49
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,932
you're gonna die in here.

50
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,647
When did you first meet Samsik?

51
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,615
Hey, all this food in here is cold.

52
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,034
Get us something hot to eat and hurry.
Come on, come on!

53
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,494
November 30, 1959

58
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,560
I'd been passed over
for a promotion that day,

59
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,563
and I was feeling like shit.

60
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,358
So I had quite a lot to drink.

61
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,989
General Jang talked to me
about the Logistics Command.

62
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:14,202
So, does that mean
he'll fix you up with a job there, huh?

63
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,163
I've had it
with the miserable fucking military.

64
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,668
Here, drink up.

65
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,754
Here. Here, here, here, here.

66
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,256
Come on, fill those glasses up.

67
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,845
The incompetent idiots
are snagging all the star rankings.

68
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,183
And the factions fight
whenever they want, don't they?

69
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,270
Bow down to the government
like we're their fucking slaves.

70
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,022
Now…

71
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,149
you call this the military?

72
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,735
What the fuck's the matter?
Are you insane?

73
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,113
What?

74
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,491
Are you scared, huh?

75
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,202
You pathetic fucks.

76
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,163
It's time for some changes here, huh?

77
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,291
Our country's a total mess

78
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,919
and the soldiers have nothing better
to do than drink all day long!

79
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,743
<i>♪ Waterfowl ♪</i>

80
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,382
So, our captain here seems
to have a fire burning in his soul, huh?

81
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,636
Who's gonna tame all that fiery energy?

82
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,223
What is this, huh?

83
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,019
I guess it's a little unfair.

84
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,229
You're an Albright graduate,
second in your class,

85
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,064
and you didn't get promoted, did you?

86
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,317
And who are you?

87
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,236
You want me to get you a star ranking?

88
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,281
A star…

89
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,741
You must be crazy.

90
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,577
General Jang Doosik left the military.

91
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,079
I wonder how he got his star.

92
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,887
So that was how
Samsik first approached me.

93
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,432
We'd just met,
and he said all sorts of things.

94
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,227
Some are from the Japanese military,
others from the Manchurian.

95
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,606
The factions fight, it's all corrupt.
Why is the military like this?

96
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,274
Because it's been poisoned?

97
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,193
Yes, that's right.
Who poisoned it, though?

98
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,529
Politics.

99
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,491
That's what poisoned the military.
Don't you see it?

100
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,285
The government turned
the military into its puppet.

101
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,746
We need to reform politics
to cleanse the military.

102
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,456
-And if not…
-And if not?

103
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,547
Then the military has to cleanse politics.

104
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,510
You'd just met?

105
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,594
Yes.

106
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,221
Out of the blue?

107
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,139
Out of the blue.

108
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,311
Even the Minister of National Defense
gets his orders from Minister Choi Minkyu.

109
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,523
Every key unit in the military
is packed with Choi Minkyu's guys.

110
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,775
Don't you think that seems a little off?

111
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,152
Yeah, b-but what can we do about it?

112
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,742
You know the head of the CIC,
Hong Youngki?

113
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,453
If we use him,

114
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,498
then we can sever the poisoned parts
of the military.

115
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,714
Hong Youngki is
the most poisoned one of all.

116
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,798
Exactly.

117
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,221
Let's use Youngki for everything we can
and then throw him away in the end.

118
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,695
So this is what Hanmin is saying?

119
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,698
That's the statement he just gave.

120
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,451
Uncle Samsik first met Hong Youngki
on that same day.

121
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,953
How do you know it was the same day?

122
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,538
I heard it later on.

123
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,166
So Hong Youngki wasn't in on it
until after?

124
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,375
Yes, that's right.

125
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,880
What do you mean "heard it later on"?

126
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,007
I heard about the military
supplies business.

127
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,224
Selling off old US Military supplies?

128
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,642
Yes, that's right.

129
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,854
Jeong Hanmin, Kim Kwangmin…

130
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,524
they were also tied up in it,
weren't they?

131
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,239
The younger officers were resorting
to skipping meals.

132
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,826
Well, you must've been aware
of it, Captain Lee.

133
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,578
Everyone was about to explode.

134
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,539
Who suggested
the US Military supplies business?

135
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,625
It was Samsik, of course.

136
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,888
Kim San says Samsik met Youngki
for the first time that day.

137
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,726
Someone who barely knew
Hong Youngki existed…

138
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,813
…came up with this plan?

139
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,899
He planned it the second they met?

140
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,908
Samsik has always been
that kind of person.

141
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,875
Hong Youngki can be talked into taking
control of key units around the capital.

142
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,168
We'll get you promoted soon

143
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,754
and I'll make you Deputy Commander
of the Capital Defense Unit.

144
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,803
Is this really possible?

145
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,389
How many soldiers
have you stripped of their titles?

146
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,684
When Rhee Seungmin's administration
comes to an end,

147
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,229
you think those soldiers
would just leave you alone?

148
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,691
Hong Youngki's easy to get to.

149
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,360
Do you know
what his main weakness is, Hanmin?

150
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,404
I don't.

151
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,698
It's that he has too many enemies.

152
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,410
And the fear that that gives Hong Youngki
is his greatest weakness.

153
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,747
Why did you lock up those petty thieves?

154
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,250
The US Military Command

155
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,419
goes on and on about exploitation.

156
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,423
And it's all nonsense.

157
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,721
They think I captured all those people
and then framed them as communists.

158
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,811
Those fuckers don't know
the first thing about commies.

159
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,108
Anyway, I locked those thieves up
because I had to do something.

160
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,611
To satisfy them.

161
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,657
You should let them go.

162
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,120
Why would I?

163
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,251
We're in business with some
of the US Military Supply officers.

164
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,090
If you grant a few of our requests,

165
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,927
30% of the profits will be yours.

166
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,473
And I'll even provide you
with a few sturdy men for your protection.

167
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,936
<i>And that's how we won over
Commander Hong Youngki.</i>

168
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,105
<i>Yeah, in the end,</i>

169
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,609
the Seodaemun thugs
were released immediately.

170
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,573
- Yeah!
- All right.

171
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,078
That's the way this man called
Uncle Samsik generally likes to operate.

172
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,022
<i>Uncle Samsik never does anything
with just one objective in mind.</i>

173
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>The US Military supply business?</i>

174
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,652
<i>Though I didn't know it at the time,</i>

175
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,821
<i>it wasn't just about money.</i>

176
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,116
Korean people have always had
incredibly robust stomachs.

177
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,368
They can eat canned food
that's two years expired,

178
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,578
-and they'll be completely fine.
-Yeah. Expired food?

179
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,622
- I'd eat that.
- And Koreans are great drivers.

180
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,582
You know that? The best drivers, huh?

181
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,419
We can drive incredibly safely
even with tires that US troops

182
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,920
have been using for 10 years.

183
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,506
Yeah, driving around on worn out tires?

184
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,341
That's okay. We'll drive on 'em.

185
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,592
Without accidents.

186
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,645
<i>Expired products from US Military bases</i>

187
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,647
<i>like used tires…</i>

188
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,899
They're still okay to use, right?

189
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,944
<i>…and worn out vehicles</i>

190
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,948
<i>were sold for 10 times their price
on the black market.</i>

191
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,077
<i>Scrap tires that were 10 years old?</i>

192
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,413
<i>We sold a hundred every day.</i>

193
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,418
<i>Expired canned goods
would get fresh new labels.</i>

194
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,838
<i>And were sold by the hundreds, really.</i>

195
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,761
- <i>Every day, more cash flowed in.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

196
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,097
<i>We packaged our products
in Sail Bakery bread boxes,</i>

197
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,393
<i>and then ship them
everywhere as bribes.</i>

198
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,106
<i>We sent them to the police,
the press, the military.</i>

199
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,817
<i>And 30% of the profits</i>

200
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,903
<i>went to Hong Youngki.</i>

201
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,031
Even so, they still made us a fortune.

202
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,464
He's not as crazy as he might seem.

203
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,758
Samsik…

204
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,677
he isn't like the rest of us.

205
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,180
That's what I thought.

206
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,603
Receipts for army supplies

207
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,648
Were you involved in this
from the very beginning?

208
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,569
I got into it without knowing
the finer details.

209
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,822
Was the Capital Defense Unit
your target from the start?

210
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,365
Not when I first started out.

211
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,370
Who recruited Capital Defense Officers
Pak Wonil and Kim Inho?

212
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,165
I did, sir.

213
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,917
Here are Captains Kim Inho
and Pak Wonil.

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,710
- Mm.
- Nice to meet you.

215
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,546
I heard you were both Albright scholars.

216
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,509
Jeong Hanmin, Kim Kwangmin,

217
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,094
these men are…

218
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,721
also Albright scholars like you?

219
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,223
Yes, that's right.

220
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,685
But you knew they were involved
in the US Military supplies business?

221
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,645
I wasn't sure.

222
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,654
San.

223
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,197
Hey, Kim San!

224
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,077
What brings you here?

225
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,496
Let's chat for a moment.

226
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,747
Kim Kwangmin
CEO of Sanae Corporation

227
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,333
-I should get to work.
-It won't take long. Just a moment.

228
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,465
What is it?

229
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,344
I have a favor to ask you.

230
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,307
All right, tell me what it is.

231
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,518
Oh, San.

232
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,897
We're trying to build
a caustic soda factory.

233
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,773
-A lye factory?
-Yes.

234
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,942
We already have a grant
for five-ton pilot plant.

235
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,863
But apparently, Daemyeon Construction
submitted an identical application.

236
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,533
So they're trying to intercept it.

237
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,703
Well, I've already filed for an appeal.

238
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,706
Is there any way you can help?

239
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,375
I'll look into it.

240
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,044
Thanks, I know you're busy.

241
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,008
So you're saying it was all
Samsik's ploy to win Kim San over?

242
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,927
And the military supply business was bait?

243
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,346
And Kim Kwangmin, Sanae Produce's owner?

244
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,352
He was recommended by Yoo Yeonchul
from Daemyeon Construction.

245
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,361
Did you go and tell them,
the Cheongwoo Federation?

246
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,487
Yes, I did.

247
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,948
I already told them.

248
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,493
Do they know Director Kim Kwangmin
at the Cheongwoo Federation?

249
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,204
Yeah, they did. I told them all about it.

250
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,914
We need to speak with them again today.

251
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,959
Oh, you're here.

252
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,002
This is Kim Kwangmin from Sanae Produce.

253
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,046
-Yes, I've heard good things about you.
-Thank you.

254
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,214
Have a seat.

255
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,508
Hi there. Yoo Yeonchul
from Daemyeon Construction.

256
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,885
I'm Kim Kwangmin.

257
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,345
Mm.

258
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,848
I heard you were withdrawing
your application for the lye factory.

259
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,642
Well, that all depends on you.

260
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,980
You were an Albright scholar, weren't you?

261
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,064
Yes.

262
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,983
Yeah. You really look like it.

263
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,196
I'm prepared
to make you a lucrative offer.

264
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,491
All I need is for you
to withdraw the factory application.

265
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,285
As long as you're not trying to impact
our business--

266
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,369
Hey, kid.

267
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,748
Look, have you heard
of the Cheongwoo Federation?

268
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,334
Yes.

269
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,296
Isn't that a group of businessmen
from the northwest?

270
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,880
Its members are all top businessmen.

271
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,965
That's right.

272
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,093
If you'd like, we could help you
become a part of it.

273
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,138
Well, how would you…

274
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,977
Well, Yoo Yeonchul is just a laborer
and he's in the Cheongwoo Federation now.

275
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,564
Don't let this opportunity pass you by.

276
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,732
Here.

277
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>Why did Daemyeon
Construction apply to build a lye factory?</i>

278
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,577
Withdrawal of application
for caustic soda factory establishment

279
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,996
<i>They were never really
interested in the factory, were they?</i>

280
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,458
<i>No. I don't think they were.</i>

281
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,918
<i>It was just bait to lure me in.</i>

282
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,003
Hello?

283
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,963
Oh, hey, Kwangmin. It's San.

284
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,133
Daemyeon Construction
withdrew its business plan.

285
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,217
Really?

286
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,219
That's good to hear.

287
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,387
You already knew?

288
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,930
No, I didn't know.

289
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,184
<i>I should buy you dinner
as a thanks for looking into it.</i>

290
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,310
Don't worry about it.

291
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,395
Thanks.

292
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,483
<i>They had Jeong Hanmin
with the military supply business</i>

293
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,526
<i>and Kim Kwangmin with the lye factory.</i>

294
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>And that's how they got to your friends?</i>

295
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,868
<i>That's right.</i>

296
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,330
This coffee is cold now.

297
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,876
He needs his friends beside him.

298
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,836
Yes.

299
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,839
They should be there
supporting him during these hard times.

300
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,720
Ministry of Home Affairs

301
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,808
Comprehensive economic policy for
the 5-year National Reconstruction Plan

302
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,029
<i>I couldn't let go
of the National Reconstruction Proposal</i>

303
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,656
<i>even at the Audit Bureau.</i>

304
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,324
<i>I was afraid that my dreams would…</i>

305
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,576
<i>Well, never be realized.</i>

306
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,330
-Yeah, sure, yes. Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

307
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,832
-Great. Have a good day.
-Thank you.

308
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,917
-Oh.
-Hi. How are you?

309
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,169
-What can I get you?
-How much are they?

310
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,296
It's 300 hwan for one bag.

311
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,514
-I'll come back.
-All right. Thank you.

312
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,182
<i>No matter how hard I tried,</i>

313
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,309
<i>it was hopeless.</i>

314
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,483
Hey, when did you get here?

315
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,742
Hey, San.

316
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,748
Jeong Hanmin.

317
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,042
Oh, oh, oh. Okay, you're pretty drunk.

318
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,170
You're making me wanna stop drinking.

319
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,921
Okay. Okay.

320
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,089
Hey, let me introduce you.

321
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,551
These are Captains Kim Inho and Pak Wonil.

322
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,677
Nice to meet you.

323
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,054
I heard you were both Albright scholars.

324
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,931
Long time ago.

325
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,600
Long time…

326
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,066
Get up.

327
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,986
You've had a lot to drink.

328
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,112
Sorry.

329
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,742
I'm not in the military.

330
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,946
Jina.

331
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,117
Jina, your uncle's home.

332
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,372
Jina.

333
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,208
-Uncle.
-Jina.

334
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,584
Come here. Look.

335
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,546
I got you a little treat.

336
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,340
Have some.

337
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,218
Uncle, were you out drinking?

338
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,347
Sorry.

339
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,641
It's cold.

340
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,725
Go back inside.

341
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,727
- Hi, I'm back.
- Are you all right?

342
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,230
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Oh, my.

343
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,608
You should come in and lie down.

344
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,485
-Okay.
-That's it.

345
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,738
Ooh. Goodness, you're quite drunk.

346
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,991
- Come on.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

347
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,909
Come in and rest.

348
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,135
What are you thinking, huh?

349
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,517
Is there something you wanna say?

350
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,771
Even if there is, you can't say it anyway.

351
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,402
You don't have the energy to say anything.

352
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,577
When the US Military
was bombing us nonstop,

353
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,415
you made my brother go out
and beg for scraps to eat.

354
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,712
He left his pregnant wife at home.

355
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,551
You made him go during that…

356
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,056
during that air raid.

357
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,893
And my brother died.

358
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,439
Do you know how hard that was on his wife?

359
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,150
Father.

360
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,155
It shouldn't have been him.

361
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,161
It should've been you that day.

362
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,667
Not him.

363
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,339
It should've been you instead.

364
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,872
Yeah, he just passed by here.

365
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,543
Hmm, he was very well-dressed.

366
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,213
Uh, he's just handsome, is all.
Yeah, bye now.

367
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,108
-Thank you again.
-Of course. Bye now.

368
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,330
Innovation Party

369
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,750
Are you sure he's coming?

370
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,169
Have the guys call up
Uncle Samsik, all right?

371
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:03,259
CEO Pak Doochill

372
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,304
Just wait there.

373
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,847
He'll eventually make his way over.

374
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,141
Just stay on standby and be ready.

375
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,730
He's coming, he's coming.
Kim San, he's on his way.

376
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,815
Let's get ready.

377
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,234
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quick, quick, quick!

378
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,361
He's here, he's here.

379
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,871
He's going in.

380
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,167
Oh, fuck, he's leaving.

381
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,252
Wait.

382
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,556
Just go in.

383
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,849
Go on.

384
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,813
Go inside. That's it.

385
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,151
He's in. He's in.

386
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,462
Can I come in?

387
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,180
Why did you leave like that?

388
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,100
I remembered I had something to do
so I took care of it.

389
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,103
Is Mr. Choo not here?

390
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,106
My father's out at dinner.

391
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,941
Could you just wait a little?

392
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,386
Choo Intae just left.

393
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,890
I think I'll have to come in tomorrow.
Even though it's a Sunday.

394
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,018
Someone has to go through all of this.

395
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,356
So many people wanna be party members.

396
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,192
But we're still short-staffed.

397
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,000
San.

398
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,293
Oh. I'm sorry.

399
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,174
Go and lie down.

400
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:50,969
What?

401
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,721
Lie down.

402
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,770
I'll just take a short break.

403
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,357
And I'll take one with you.

404
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,026
Actually…

405
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,990
I could be taking a long break soon.

406
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,661
Is it true you left
the Ministry of Home Affairs?

407
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,460
Do you think…

408
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,965
there might be a position for me
in the Innovation Party?

409
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,177
So you want to get into politics?

410
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,728
I think the Innovation Party
isn't ready yet.

411
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,232
I have great respect for Mr. Choo Intae.

412
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,277
And I believe…

413
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,864
- What is this? What is this?
- Fire! Fire!

414
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,997
-Get out of here! Get out!
-Yeojin!

415
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,499
Hey.

416
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,876
Get out!

417
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,484
Are you okay?

418
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,153
Police!

419
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,405
Somebody help! Where is everyone?

420
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,909
Mr. Choo. Mr. Choo!

421
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,414
Mr. Choo!

422
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,195
Choo Intae's fleeing!

423
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,906
Hey, Choo Intae!
Look! He's getting away!

424
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,278
Hey, Choo Intae is fleeing!

425
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,405
Hey, Choo Intae!

426
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:15,882
Gyeongmudae

427
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:22,054
Inspired by the encouragement
and strong support of the people,

428
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,559
I hereby announce a decision
I've made out of love for the nation.

429
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,312
<i>I am…</i>

430
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,357
<i>revoking the withdrawal
of my presidential candidacy.</i>

431
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,027
Ministry of Home Affairs

432
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,280
<i>In order to save South Korea
from its current state of crisis.</i>

433
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,157
Democratic Party

434
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,658
<i>I am officially…</i>

435
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,743
Liberal Party

436
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,537
<i>…presenting myself as a candidate</i>

437
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,749
<i>in the upcoming presidential election.</i>

438
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,386
Rhee Seungmin! Rhee Seungmin!

439
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,641
-Rhee Seungmin!
-Rhee Seungmin!

440
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,688
-Rhee Seungmin!
-Rhee Seungmin!

441
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,820
It was the day that the president
announced his candidacy.

442
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,490
All his supporters
were out in the streets.

443
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,371
<i>During the war when our country
was taken from us,</i>

444
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,164
<i>we were defenseless.</i>

445
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,550
An incompetent head of the household.

446
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,222
<i>A coward of a man.
That had always been my idea of a father.</i>

447
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,479
Mr. Choo Intae had been
another father figure to me.

448
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,024
But in the end…

449
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,486
he was no different than my own father.

450
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,949
But I guess I'd always thought that…

451
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,121
fatherhood looked that way.

452
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,901
You finally picked up.

453
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,613
No matter how hard I try…

454
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,702
there's nothing that I can do.

455
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,373
Effort is meaningless in this world.

456
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,166
Why not flip it upside down?

457
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,253
And what if it's wrong?

458
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,713
Then spit it out.

459
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,549
You'll know if it's poison
the minute it touches your lips.

460
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,551
And my proposal?

461
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,346
Can we save it?

462
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,099
Save it, or kill it, we can do anything.

463
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,351
<i>I'm asking if we can make it
happen naturally.</i>

464
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,104
Letting it happen on its own

465
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,189
will also cost you.

466
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,526
Does the Earth's rotation and revolution
just happen?

467
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,153
Is it a coincidence that the Sun
lights up the Earth?

468
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,992
I want more power. Tell me how to get it.

469
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,744
I will give it to you.

470
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,123
I'm the one who can give it to you.

471
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,545
I'll wait to hear from you.

472
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,074
Mr. Hong, my name is Samsik.
