1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,343
It's out of love and respect
that everybody calls me

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:15,432
Samsik, brother Samsik, Uncle Samsik…
and I just love it.

3
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,477
My nickname, I mean.

4
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:29,320
Year 1960
Unknown, South Korea

5
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,458
Capital Defense Unit, Secret Bunker

6
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,133
It's a standard investigation.

7
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,302
If you cooperate,
it shouldn't take too long.

8
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,971
Good to see you here…

9
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,974
Colonel.

10
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,662
Hanmin.

11
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,124
San, is that you? You're here too?

12
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,126
San!

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,004
We didn't plan any of this!

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,923
This was all Samsik, not us!

15
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,174
Tell them, please!

16
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,177
Tell them it was all Samsik! It's not us!

17
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,360
You knew Pak Doochill,
the CEO of Sail Developments?

18
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,238
Yes, I know him.

19
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,492
You called him Samsik, right?

20
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,038
I did.

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,582
What does it mean, Samsik?

22
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,297
He made sure everyone had three meals
even during the war.

23
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,136
"Sam" means three. "Sik" means food.

24
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,596
Three meals.

25
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,893
He doesn't let anyone go hungry.

26
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,480
Uncle Samsik

27
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,538
Uncle Samsik

28
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:30,585
Three Meals a Day

29
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,464
November 26, 1959
Seoul, South Korea

30
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,719
US Army, Oil Storage Facility

31
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,393
- Two?
- Two.

32
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,645
- 20,000 hwan.
- For the oil.

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,605
What's "oil" in English?

34
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,856
That's 10 bills.

35
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,650
Oil. Oil.

36
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,487
That's 20,000 hwan.

37
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,239
That's 20,000 hwan.

38
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,199
A little bit more,
a little bit more.

39
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,283
What the fuck is he saying?

40
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,498
-Get out! Get out of here!
-Run!

41
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,056
What was that?

42
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,226
Gu Haejun and Han Soo
Seodaemun Gang

43
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,310
Shit.

44
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,979
November 30, 1959
Seoul, South Korea

45
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,522
Rhee Seungmin to run for reelection

46
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,691
We must protect our president!

47
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,237
That's the thing about Samsik, you know,
he's got connections everywhere.

48
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,198
And those guys in Gunsan
got caught smuggling Japanese radios,

49
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,201
-Samsik got them all out there too.
-Yeah, you said that already.

50
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,327
Oh, did I?

51
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,205
Hey, don't talk back to me,
you little brat.

52
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,042
I heard everyone got turned over
to the CIC.

53
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
How much longer we got to wait?

54
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,545
Hey, keep it down!

55
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,088
Hey, don't, I'm serious.

56
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,802
He will see you now.

57
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,473
Our hope! Our hope!

58
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,809
We want Rhee! We want Rhee!

59
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,853
Retract it! Retract it!

60
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,192
President Rhee is our only hope!

61
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,194
Our hope! Our hope!

62
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,413
Yes, in here. Come in.

63
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,750
We want Rhee! We want Rhee!

64
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,209
Uncle Samsik?

65
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,295
We support the president's reelection!

66
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,255
We support! We support!

67
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,007
Come in, come in. Here.

68
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,351
So, you're with the Soedaemun gang?

69
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,770
-Yes.
-You stole oil from US troops?

70
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,106
Yeah, now,
our boys are being held at the CIC.

71
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,524
Why the CIC?

72
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,985
I'm not sure,
the Counter Intelligence Corps…

73
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,947
Over in Osaka, thugs don't have to hide,
they drive around freely.

74
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,034
And then we have you two
who are doing nothing more

75
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,952
than just a little petty theft.

76
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,622
Don't you think you should try
something a bit more decent?

77
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,873
Just tell us.

78
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,792
Can you get our guys out of there or not?

79
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,377
And if I can?

80
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,045
We'll pay you well.

81
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,507
You're pretty cocky
for someone trying to ask a favor.

82
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,759
Let's go.

83
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,094
Hey, come on, man!

84
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,178
Let's go!

85
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,388
- Hey, Han Soo!
- Let's go!

86
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,514
Look at you.

87
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,307
Leaving just like that?

88
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,396
Hey, how about you try
calling me Uncle Samsik?

89
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,064
Call you what?

90
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,983
Try it, try calling me Uncle Samsik.

91
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,485
Why should I?

92
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,112
Because I'll feed you.

93
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,406
I won't pretend you're family
just to get fed.

94
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,950
All right.

95
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,202
You know Yoon Palbong
with the Dongdaemun gang?

96
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,286
I can give you his turf.

97
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,580
But Yoon Palbong
is with the Liberal Party.

98
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,999
-How could we…
-I'm saying I could give it to you.

99
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,838
-Miss Kim, bring me 10 envelopes.
-Yes?

100
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,300
I'm giving you this money

101
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,261
and you're going to break
Yoon Palbong's legs.

102
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,850
<i>Protests continue throughout the country</i>

103
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,269
<i>expressing opposition
to President Rhee's withdrawal</i>

104
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,062
<i>of his candidacy for reelection.</i>

105
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,690
<i>Political circles
are closely following the protests</i>

106
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,317
<i>and are waiting to see
whether President Rhee…</i>

107
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,903
- Let's go, Jina.
<i>- …and run for reelection.</i>

108
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,498
Jina.

109
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,468
Uncle, is your report going to help
our country get better?

110
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,221
You just focus on your studies, hmm?

111
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,389
Put your shoes on.

112
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,269
We're off. See you later.

113
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,146
- Have a nice day.
- Let's go.

114
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,565
- Bye, Jina. Study hard.
- Okay.

115
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,153
Ministry of Home Affairs

116
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,743
National Reconstruction Bureau.
Oh, hello.

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,161
Mr. Kim.

118
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,704
- Mr. Kim?
- Yes?

119
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,955
Phone call, sir.

120
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,958
Who is it?

121
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,294
Hello, this is Manager Kim.

122
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,546
- <i>Hello, San.</i>
- Yeojin.

123
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,175
Hi, are you free to talk?

124
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,718
<i>Yes, I'm free.</i>

125
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,846
Listen, I don't want you to come today.

126
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,140
I've been noticing
a lot of suspicious people lurking around.

127
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,266
<i>Wait, what do you mean?</i>

128
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,019
I'll come right after work.
Don't worry about it.

129
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,063
I'll see you later.

130
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,068
-Oh, Mr. Kim, the minister's here. Hurry.
-Great.

131
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,402
-Be right there.
-Come on. Hurry!

132
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,412
Miss Kim.

133
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,705
Site for Seohae Oil Factory

134
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,790
Yes?

135
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,961
Can you see…
the Seohae Oil factory from there?

136
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,797
-I can.
-Mm.

137
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,924
Once that's in place,

138
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,760
I'll be an official member
of the Cheongwoo Federation.

139
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,512
You understand what that means, right?

140
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,473
You'll be
a South Korean nobility?

141
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,351
South Korean nobility? Please.

142
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,687
I'll be the one
reigning over the nobility.

143
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,146
Huh?

144
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,901
Hurry. Let's go.

145
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,987
San, hurry!

146
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,364
- They're almost here! Let's go, come on!
- Okay, I'm coming.

147
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,043
General Jang Doosik is heading
to Taepyeonggak.

148
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,255
Why does he insist to calling me over?

149
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,840
To watch him pig out?

150
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,474
Boy, you sure did a fine job
with those shoes.

151
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,229
Yoon Palbong's coming.

152
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,441
- Let's go, just go. Don't look.
- Hey, Samsik!

153
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,401
Damn it, Samsik!

154
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,779
Well, well, well.
Well, if it isn't Yoon Palbong.

155
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,072
Good day to you.

156
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,993
I've called up 25 of my men for later.

157
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,121
Ah, good. How reassuring. Huh?

158
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,416
Did you talk to Kang Seongmin?

159
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,876
Oh, of course.

160
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,713
-Hey.
-Hey now, people are watching.

161
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,798
-Hey, just give me a straight answer.
-Come on, they're looking.

162
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,926
If what we did in Busan ever comes out,
the three of us are dead.

163
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,264
If I don't get the Dongdaemun nomination,
I won't take it lying down.

164
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,932
Have you gone insane?

165
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,060
I told you to stop bringing up Busan.

166
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,895
I'll stop when Kang Seongmin
keeps his promise.

167
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,980
And why are you being so impatient?

168
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,360
Listen, he surely has everything handled.
So, don't worry.

169
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,613
-Then why is he avoiding me?
-You keep visiting him uninvited.

170
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,867
Listen, don't forget
what we did for Kang Seongmin, okay?

171
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,244
Were we ever rewarded for it?

172
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,247
I'll be at the Innovation Party's speech
to show you what I'm made of.

173
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,084
So you tell him
that this is his last warning.

174
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,055
That bastard's stepping out of line.

175
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,474
You told the police to pull out, right?

176
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,976
Yes, I made the call.

177
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,979
Get ready to be humiliated today.

178
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,119
Let's begin.

179
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,458
The unemployment rate has sharply
increased due to the collapse of farms,

180
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,419
small manufacturers, and traders.

181
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,839
The agricultural surpluses
from USAID are fueling farming debt.

182
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,966
80% of which is in private loans

183
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,759
with annual interest rates of over 6%.

184
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,095
The agricultural economy
is on the brink of collapse.

185
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,389
Now with South Korea's
abundant young workforce…

186
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,563
The president is asking for you.

187
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,981
Is he running for reelection?

188
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,691
He said he's not sure yet.

189
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,569
- That's all for today.
- Sir,

190
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,446
-we've barely started the briefing.
-It can wait.

191
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,531
Our team spent all night
putting it together.

192
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,951
Who is that guy?

193
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,120
He's manager Kim San
from the National Reconstruction Bureau.

194
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,329
Minister Choi.

195
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,083
The way forward for South Korea…
is laid out here.

196
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,502
Why is he so cocky?

197
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,130
Well, he studied economics in the US.

198
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,258
He was also an Albright scholar, sir.

199
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,718
-Albright?
-Yes.

200
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,889
-Were you in the military?
-Yes, that's right.

201
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,975
What's a military academy grad doing here?
You couldn't adjust to it?

202
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,604
Minister Choi,
the president is waiting for you.

203
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,774
Submit the report again.

204
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,859
We've already submitted several.

205
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,695
-But… we'll resubmit it.
-We've been doing that for two years.

206
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,615
Right now, the president's reelection
is our top priority.

207
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,325
Why is that your priority?

208
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,203
Unemployment is through the roof,
agriculture is falling apart,

209
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,830
this country can't do anything
without American aid.

210
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,333
-Is he out of his mind or what?
-Hey, hey.

211
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,918
Minister, please just give us an hour.

212
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,628
Minister Choi.

213
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,464
Minister Choi!
Please just give us one hour!

214
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,092
Oh, God.

215
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,470
We've been running reports for two years.

216
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,434

222
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,667
Why did he bring the whole flock here?

223
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,252
I wonder.

224
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,676

Hey, Samsik.

227
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,936
How strange. This bottle's gone lower.

228
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,145
It was up to here.

229
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,730
Are you all right?

230
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,650
Why is a general hanging around
with a bunch of rookies, huh?

231
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,403
A general should treat his men
to food and booze

232
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,072
in order to gain their respect,
ain't that right?

233
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,658
But I pay for their booze, don't I?

234
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,288
Are you close with Hong Youngki,
the head of CIC?

235
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,876
Hong Youngki? Why?

236
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,589
Uh, my nephew got caught stealing oil
from US troops and the CIC detained him.

237
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,798
You want me to get him out?

238
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,174
Yes, I do.

239
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,011
You're making a general
do menial task, huh?

240
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,097
I made you a general precisely
so you could do such task.

241
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,354
Don't you know what Hong Youngki is like?

242
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,441
If he would get a hold of you,
it doesn't matter what rank you are.

243
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,109
Just last year…

244
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,779
he got a third of all our generals
stripped of their badges.

245
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,698
How's that? On what grounds?

246
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,702
Well, you're a commie
if Hong Youngki says you're a commie.

247
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,371
He goes and cooks up some evidence
and you're behind bars.

248
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,878
-I guess he and I are similar then.
-How so?

249
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,339
Well, you just said
he can get generals dismissed.

250
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,592
Why would someone like that
bother with petty thieves?

251
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,094
-He wants to use them as bait.
-Bait?

252
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,638
Go and meet Hong Youngki.

253
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,853
Are you insane?

254
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,981
Why would you argue with the minister?
Might as well punch the guy in the face!

255
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,651
If you want to go rogue,
then get into politics!

256
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,653
Go and be a politician like Choo Intae!

257
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,322
Go and run a campaign, give speeches!

258
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,949
-I'm going to.
-What?

259
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,660
I'm giving a speech
at the current affairs talk later.

260
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,746
A civil servant,
speaking in front of the Innovation Party?

261
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,499
Mr. Choo Intae is like a father to me.

262
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,417
Well, he's not your real father, kid.

263
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,252
- So stay out of there. Hey!
- I'm heading out.

264
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,338
You're still on the clock!

265
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,426
I'm done writing reports.

266
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,053
Stop writing them.

267
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,104
Office of the President

268
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,104
Office of the President

269
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,398
I've served three terms

270
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,900
as president of this country.

271
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,612
Well, it is what the people want, sir.

272
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,656
I already withdrew my candidacy.

273
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,783
If I go back on my word…

274
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,909
"President"

275
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,287
…they'll surely criticize me.

276
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,250
Have you seen
Choo Intae's approval rating?

277
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,545
So, do you actually think
I could beat him?

278
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,964
Yes, sir. I'm certain.

279
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,843
I'll use any means necessary
to get you elected.

280
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,637
You'll use any means necessary?

281
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,805
Yes.

282
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,557
You can count on me.

283
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:10,612
Banya Hotel

284
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,866
Right. The Cheongwoo Federation…

285
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,950
Hello.

286
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,829
Ah, right. Keep it up. Here.

287
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,289
For you.

288
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,251
"Thanks to the guidance
of the Cheongwoo Federation members.

289
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:28,422
I… I'm here
at this distinguished event today.

290
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,468
This honorable…" How corny.

291
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,596
So? Are you ready?

292
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,514
Honestly, I'm nervous.

293
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,683
Well, congratulations.

294
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,519
Not everyone gets inducted
into the Cheongwoo Federation.

295
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,064
You're one of the top businessmen
in the whole country.

296
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,985
"Thanks to An Yosub's guidance,
I have the honor of…"

297
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,406
I now have the honor
of standing here before you. Yes.

298
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,618
As soon as our industrial complex
is finished…

299
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,415
we all will be eating pizza
like the Americans.

300
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,919
Pizza. I'm sure
that none of you have heard of it.

301
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,588
Ah, it's extraordinary.

302
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,132
Come on, this is taking too long.

303
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,764
So, since he's acquired us
60% stake in Seohae Oil,

304
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,017
I believe we can officially welcome
our new member Samsik.

305
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,853
No, Mr. Pak Doochill, I mean.

306
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,356
All in favor of accepting our new member?

307
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,666
Petron Harvest,
Sierra Union, Hassel Chemistry…

308
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,918
All eight companies
that agreed to the partnership

309
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,628
have given the same response.

310
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,839
Payment guarantees
from the Korean government,

311
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,590
the right to use port facilities,

312
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,551
the right to manage railways,

313
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,929
and they want diplomatic status
for their staff at the complex?

314
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,306
It's like they want to call off the deal!

315
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,558
An Kichul
An Yosub's youngest son

316
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,396
Hey, do you know what pizza is?
I doubt it.

317
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,191
They use an oven
that's wider than your bedroom

318
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,110
to bake bread bigger than you are.

319
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:17,281
And you add meat, cheese, vegetables. Ah…

320
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,699
You take one bite, and…

321
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,410
Ah, you probably
haven't heard of cheese either.

322
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,829
Cheese? Cheese is like bread, right?

323
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,331
Man, oh, man, oh, man!
Look at you, it's so obvious

324
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,791
you're a blue-collar worker.

325
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,295
Yoo Yeonchul, how are you
in the Cheongwoo Federation, huh?

326
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,673
People in America,
they eat that bread daily.

327
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,467
- And most of them don't even eat it all.
- Uh-huh.

328
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,511
Once the industrial complex is complete,

329
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,306
then we'll have bread like theirs
and we'll throw out the rest.

330
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,310
There must be some reason
they're suddenly doing this.

331
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,229
Think about all the money
we poured into this!

332
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,193
Isn't that a bit strange that all at once,
all eight are making the same demand?

333
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,113
I'll look into possible motives
right away, sir.

334
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,281
Kang Seongmin.

335
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,159
Bring him right now.

336
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,536
Yes, sir.

337
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,876
Yeah, the day is coming soon.

338
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,544
Hey, how'd it go?

339
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,171
What's going on?

340
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,173
Petron Harvest is now…

341
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,925
making certain demands.

342
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,927
Huh? What demands?

343
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,015
I don't understand all this.
What does it say?

344
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,059
A payment guarantee from the government,

345
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,936
the right to use port facilities,

346
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,687
and the right to audit government grants.

347
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,606
Uh, but why all of a sudden?

348
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,151
Well, these bastards, they just
can't trust the Korean government.

349
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,528
Unbelievable.

350
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,780
Well then, what's next?

351
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,699
I have no idea.
It could mean it's the end.

352
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,701
Am I…

353
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,287
I'm still a Cheongwoo Federation member,
aren't I?

354
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,040
If there's no Seohae Oil,
then it sounds like the show is over.

355
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,836
Oh.

356
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,974
Hey, hey, get out, get out, get out.

357
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,187
Kang Seongmin.

358
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,982
Why is it so hard to reach you?

359
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,818
I thought I told you to stay away.

360
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,154
You heard about
the Innovation Party speech today?

361
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,991
We're about to send 25 of our men.

362
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,119
So I'm asking you
to acknowledge what we've done.

363
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,954
Fine.

364
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,914
We'll speak after the election.

365
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,460
The Dongdaemun nomination,

366
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,463
there's a rumor
it's going to some other guy.

367
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,050
Keep your promises
and don't just use people.

368
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,969
Yosub will be there, won't he?

369
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,098
I wonder how he'll react

370
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,226
if he finds out
who killed An Minchul in Busan.

371
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,520
Should I tell him who killed his son?

372
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,031
Kang Seongmin
Liberal Party Assemblyman

373
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,035
We've come all this way
with a single goal in mind.

374
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,037
So we have to think of something fast.

375
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,830
Oh, welcome.

376
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,667
Samsik, a word.

377
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,639
Hey, what's the matter? What's going on?

378
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,893
Yoon Palbong approached me again
just a second ago.

379
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,061
Huh?

380
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,979
That idiot showed up again?

381
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,150
I thought
I'd gotten through to him earlier.

382
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,781
I will have to teach him a proper lesson
at the Innovation Party speech later.

383
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,741
-Don't you worry about him.
-Kill him.

384
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,078
Huh?

385
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,208
Kill Yoon Palbong.

386
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,959
Quickly.

387
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,629
I'm so afraid.

388
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,965
I keep seeing An Minchul in my dreams.

389
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,889
Assemblyman, that brat Yoon Palbong,

390
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,309
all he's ever wanted
is a national assembly badge.

391
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,396
-Can't you just give it to him?
-Please kill him.

392
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,439
Do you want to watch me
worry myself to death?

393
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,070
Right.

394
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,780
As you wish.

395
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,330
Uncle Samsik,
you're the only one I can count on.

396
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,542
Please help me get some sleep at night.

397
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,655
The eight partnering companies
sent us these demands all at once.

398
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,865
Why all of a sudden?

399
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,077
They distrust the Korean government.

400
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,705
Why on earth…

401
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,208
did I let you join the national assembly?

402
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,713
If Minchul was still alive right now…

403
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,175
he would be sitting there instead of you.

404
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,637
He would've done well far better than you.

405
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,391
<i>Kang Seongmin</i>

406
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
has ordered me to kill Yoon Palbong.

407
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,521
Why?

408
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,901
He keeps mentioning what we did
in Busan together. That lunatic.

409
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,614
And how we killed An Yosub's son.

410
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,995
Do you think
the president will run for reelection?

411
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,584
-It's not certain just yet.
-He definitely will.

412
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,213
He even went so far
as to hire those filthy protesters.

413
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,380
I will look into it.

414
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,090
You're always one step behind.

415
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,012
Our industrial complex
is slipping away from us here.

416
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,600
<i>That bastard Kang Seongmin
is another coward.</i>

417
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,355
He's not satisfied
until the people he fears are killed.

418
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,981
He wants you to do it?

419
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,317
I'll be the next one.

420
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,820
Those with power and with money

421
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,699
will do everything they can to stay out
of the mud while wearing their best shoes.

422
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,662
Why do you think
he's asked me to kill Yoon Palbong?

423
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,626
I've known Kang Seongmin a long time
since he was born.

424
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,462
He gets this look

425
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,839
as if he could murder somebody
without batting an eye.

426
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,510
He had it when he told us
to kill An Minchul.

427
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,680
And he had it again just now.

428
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,431
Just wait.

429
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,143
I'm all but certain
that he'll try to kill me next.

430
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,232
Petron Harvest apparently sent
an inspection team to the Philippines.

431
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,858
They're trying to take our business there?

432
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,819
Are they out of their minds?

433
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,364
They sent an inspection team,
it's not out of the question.

434
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,783
We can't let someone else
reap our rewards.

435
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,746
Choi Minkyu has been dragging his feet
too long and now it's all ruined!

436
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,165
I'll meet with Mr. Choi Minkyu, sir.

437
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,085
Go now!
Tell him we'll give him whatever he wants.

438
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,154
Yeojin.

439
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,450
San, why are you here so early?

440
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,076
The preparations are going well?

441
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,621
Well, I'm doing my best,
but I'm not so sure.

442
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,999
This is the first time
Father will be speaking to a large crowd.

443
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,751
Don't worry about it.

444
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,878
I'm sure he'll do great.

445
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,173
Allow me to escort you, Minister.

446
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,227
Seonyoowon

447
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,621
Seonyoowon here.

448
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,706
<i>Minister Choi Minkyu has just arrived.</i>

449
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,251
He's arrived at Seonyoowon.

450
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,218
Yoon Palbong is sending 25 of his guys
to the Innovation Party event.

451
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,512
So he can cause a scene
and ruin the speech.

452
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,848
<i>It's what Yoon Palbong
has been doing for the past decade.</i>

453
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,851
<i>He always targets
opposition party politicians</i>

454
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,020
<i>under someone else's orders.</i>

455
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,648
How many men do you have?

456
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,192
Right, we have around 15 men, sir.

457
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,569
You think they are able to hold back 25?

458
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,657
Haejun, Heesung, and I
will be inside the hall.

459
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,118
And Jongsol, you look out,
when the Dongdaemun guys arrive,

460
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,619
just run them down with the truck.

461
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,663
Add more chili powder.

462
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,543
<i>I'm not worried about taking on 25 men,</i>

463
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,253
but what happens after that, sir?

464
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,005
What will happen
is we'll be the ones to get arrested,

465
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,465
not the Dongdaemun guys.

466
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,426
I guess we'll need
to get rid of the police.

467
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,219
<i>Can you keep the police away?</i>

468
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,470
Retreat.

469
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,639
Of course I can.

470
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,184
Han Soo, hey, look,
the police are all retreating.

471
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,103
- All of them?
- Yeah.

472
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,992
Yeah, good, we can handle those 25 men.

473
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,327
Yoon Palbong is our prime target.

474
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,789
You better make damn sure
to break that bastard's legs, huh?

475
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,002
<i>There will be a lot of people
attending Choo Intae's speech.</i>

476
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,671
<i>A lot of politicians.</i>

477
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,966
<i>All kinds of people will be there.</i>

478
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,177
<i>They're all trying to befriend Choo Intae.</i>

479
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,056
<i>He's more popular
than the president right now.</i>

480
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,434
<i>If he runs for office, he's sure to win.</i>

481
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,228
<i>No wonder he's being targeted.</i>

482
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,314
Choo Intae
Innovation Party Leader

483
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,149
Innovation Party's Speech

484
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,611
Peaceful reunification
and our nation's path by Choo Intae

485
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,698
Now, let us begin

486
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:30,328
the current affairs address,
hosted by the Innovation Party.

487
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,255
Choo Intae!

488
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,424
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

489
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,720
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

490
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,848
Thank you.

491
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,641
I am Choo Intae.

492
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,271
A question.
What is the way forward for our country?

493
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,606
The answer,

494
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:04,153
first of all, peaceful unification,
and second of all, peaceful unification.

495
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,866
It is the peaceful coexistence
of South and North Korea.

496
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,117
Hear, hear!

497
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,948
What has the current administration

498
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,243
done for the people of South Korea?

499
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,873
<i>Nothing. All the president's done
is impoverish our country,</i>

500
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,791
<i>bringing suffering to farmers and workers.</i>

501
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,210
Hear, hear!

502
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,138
Hey!

503
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,556
Get in there, you fucker.

504
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,601
Good fucking luck.

505
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,027
The incumbent president

506
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,949
has been putting on a little show
by withdrawing his candidacy.

507
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,702
Who on earth could possibly
fall for his tricks?

508
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,870
That's right!

509
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>There will still be
five or six Dongdaemun guys in the hall.</i>

510
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,418
<i>Can you stop them on your own?</i>

511
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,879
<i>Of course.</i>

512
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,048
<i>As long as you give me their turf…</i>

513
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,926
Uncle Samsik.

514
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,560
<i>This incumbent is shameless enough…</i>

515
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,812
Let's go.

516
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,356
…to ask for yet another term as president.

517
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,196
<i>It is his goal to wage another war</i>

518
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,615
and reach unification with violence!

519
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:17,370
Once again flooding these lands
with the blood of innocent people.

520
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,372
You'll take on 100 each, each of you.

521
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,082
If you go down, take three with you!

522
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,589
We cannot wage yet another war
on these lands.

523
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,801
Never again, everyone!

524
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,513
Choo Intae! Choo Intae!

525
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,266
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

526
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,893
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

527
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,525
Choo Intae is a commie!

528
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,903
Hey!

529
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,323
Get outta here,
you punks!

530
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,122
You motherfuckers!

531
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,169
Hey, you!

532
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,630
Let's go.

533
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,099
Someone get the police in here!

534
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,562
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

535
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,065
Call the cops. Huh?

536
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,948
Hey! Call the fucking cops right now.

537
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,404
Shit or get off the pot, alright?

538
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,574
I got it done, huh?

539
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,576
Let's go.

540
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,834
Wait a minute,
has Mr. Choo Intae already run away?

541
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,423
That lilly-liver little commie.
Can't handle politics, huh?

542
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,342
No, he can't.

543
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,760
Excuse me.

544
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,055
-Are you talking to me?
-Who are you?

545
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,641
That's Pak Jiwook of the Liberal Party.
You should stop.

546
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,476
Ah, calm down, Assemblyman.

547
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,561
Calm down.

548
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,356
Who do you think you are
interrupting an assemblyman?

549
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,066
Mr. Choo Intae is not a commie.

550
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,069
- Apologize right now.
- What?

551
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,573
He aspires to bring the people
peaceful coexistence and prosperity.

552
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,576
Well, that's precisely
what we call a commie, boy.

553
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,246
Do you have any idea
what kind of man he is?

554
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,831
Do you?

555
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,250
Have you read
<i>Co-prosperity on the Korean Peninsula?</i>

556
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,087
It's a detailed exploration
of the prosperity of a nation.

557
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,756
Do you know it, sir? I bet you don't.

558
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,216
-No, you punk.
-Well…

559
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,512
may I explain it to you?

560
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,223
-Be my guest.
-Thank you, sir.

561
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,978
Let's hear what he has to say.

562
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,654
This is where I come

563
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,365
when I want to relax, think,
or just be alone.

564
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,078
Feel free to come here, have a drink.

565
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,748
Whenever you need a moment to yourself.

566
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,708
Is this about the Cheongwoo complex?

567
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,960
I can't help you.

568
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,879
The president's opposed to it.

569
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,715
He thinks a planned economy
is something only commies do.

570
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,510
Hello, everyone.

571
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,888
I work at the Reconstruction Bureau.

572
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,099
Prior to this,
I received a doctorate in economics.

573
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,228
I was an Albright scholar
at an American university.

574
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,856
During my time in America,

575
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,652
there was beauty and abundance
everywhere I'd look.

576
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,655
Meanwhile, my countrymen
were stripped bare and starving.

577
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,910
Do you know what pizza is?

578
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,829
Has anyone tried it?

579
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,748
Mr. Pak, have you tried it, sir?

580
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,917
No, I haven't, boy.

581
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,336
During my time abroad,
I lived above a pizza shop

582
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,880
and couldn't afford
a single proper meal a day.

583
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,968
Every day, I smelled pizzas baking.

584
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,428
Every night, it kept me up.

585
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,224
Listen, the economy
matters more than guns.

586
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,144
I saw a country
where no one worried about food,

587
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,397
where you can have
three decent meals every day.

588
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,316
What I envied during my studies abroad

589
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,861
wasn't their fighter jets
or aircraft carriers. It was pi…

590
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,490
it was pizza.

591
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,158
What is the point

592
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,122
of winning a war when the entire nation
is starving to death?

593
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,252
That's why Mr. Choo Intae said

594
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,380
that I should study economics.

595
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,468
Steel, shipbuilding,
transport, chemical, oil, and textiles.

596
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,846
All the key industries a country needs.

597
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,433
They're each putting their life
on the line for this complex.

598
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,811
If we don't act quickly,
the overseas partners

599
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,022
we'll go do business
with the Philippines and Taiwan.

600
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,442
We can't afford
any further investments in facilities.

601
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,986
We poured everything we have
into this industrial complex.

602
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,863
If we can't secure foreign capital,

603
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,490
all the money we've put down…

604
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,036
it all goes down the drain.

605
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,747
So if the government
were to help us out here…

606
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,165
What?

607
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,335
You'll help us
with the presidential election?

608
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,544
Yes.

609
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,048
The president and Mr. An Yosub
are well into their eighties now.

610
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,843
How much longer do you think
they'll hold on to power?

611
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,308
My time will come soon. After that…

612
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,226
yours could too.

613
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,270
You understand?

614
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,899
With your wealth and background

615
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,901
and my political power,

616
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,738
imagine what we could do
if we share what we have?

617
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,241
I believe…

618
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,702
we'd be invincible.

619
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,913
Right.

620
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,831
I think so too.

621
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,381
Use this election to your advantage
and take control of the party.

622
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,385
Become the chairman
of the campaign committee.

623
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,720
All I need to do
is speak to the president.

624
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,515
And I could give you

625
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,184
the chance to reign
over the Liberal Party.

626
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,188
So…

627
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,359
what are you asking for in return?

628
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,405
Do you have anything…

629
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,949
aside from the Cheongwoo Federation?

630
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,415
Now take a look.

631
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,294
Seoul and Busan will be connected
by a new expressway

632
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,130
and we'll build
industrial complexes and ports.

633
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,215
Seoul and Incheon could connect too,

634
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,843
and we'd ship our goods
all the way to China.

635
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,178
If the 700 million people in China

636
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,474
each buy one pair of shoes,
we can sell 1.4 billion shoes to them.

637
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,019
Hey, smart-ass.

638
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,440
Why on earth would we sell shoes
to the damn Chinese?

639
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,984
That's the kind of ideal
only a commie would have.

640
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,152
- Exactly, yeah!
- That's right!

641
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,736
Don't commies wear shoes too?

642
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,083
The Republic of Korea

643
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,172
can use its young and abundant workforce
to become an industrialized nation.

644
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:14,180
With our peninsular position,
we could become the next center of trade.

645
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,892
That is exactly the kind of nation…

646
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,562
that Mr. Choo Intae dreams of.

647
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,032
Choo Intae! Choo Intae!

648
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,368
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!

649
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,371
-Choo Intae!
-Choo Intae!
