1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,427
Sir, we will deal
with the Busan district electorates.

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,304
Why don't we change the subject?

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,727
What are you reading?

4
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,693
{\an8}AN MINCHUL, LIBERAL PARTY ASSEMBLYMAN
AN YOSUB'S ELDEST SON

5
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,944
{\an8}You like history books?

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,904
Kang Seongmin, aged 16

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,241
Why bother reading about kings?

8
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,328
A prince only has two options in life.

9
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,874
He either becomes his father's lackey,

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,294
or he kills his father
so he can take the throne.

11
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,671
Which would you choose?

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,385
I don't like either option.

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,597
Hey.

14
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,934
Yes?

15
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,853
Come here.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,652
Weren't you taught
to respect your elders, you punk?

17
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,326
If you don't want to be king,
you've got to be someone's servant.

18
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,410
You…

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,162
You brat!

20
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,122
What do you think you're doing?

21
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,668
I'm sorry, Mr. An.

22
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,004
Your son's quite a feisty one.

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,217
He's the one who hit me first!

24
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,136
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,099
He hit me first though, I swear.

26
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,733
Oh, you're hilarious!

27
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,363
Daddy, where are you going?

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,158
Oh, my goodness! Who are you, darling?

29
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,911
Oh, that depressing
little bastard. He's… he's…

30
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,371
Is he your son, <i>oppa</i>?

31
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,664
He's quite the cutie.

32
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,792
Ah, so depressing!

33
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,766
I heard this is
where your mom killed herself.

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,104
Don't glare if you're going to look away.

35
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,029
All right…

36
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
Huh?

37
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,658
What the hell?

38
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,536
Mr. Kang, your son almost killed you.

39
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,882
You little shit. Come here.

40
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,343
Come with me, you bastard.

41
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,053
Goddammit! Come here!

42
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,679
You dirty bastard!

43
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,973
You still don't get it, do you?

44
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,516
You're a worthless piece of shit!

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,601
Just like your mother!

46
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,689
The Sineui Alliance
opposes the authorities and powers

47
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,483
that oppress our people and our nation.

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,443
"The Sineui Alliance

49
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,570

that oppress our people and our nation."

51
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,283
The Sineui Alliance
fights against injustice.

52
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,410
Our violence is a necessary evil.

53
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,497
"The Sineui Alliance
fights against injustice.

54
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,334
Our violence is a necessary evil."

55
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,962
Our first target is…

56
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,090
Mr. Kang Ilsik.

57
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,761

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,592

00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,470
{\an8}Choo Intae! Choo Intae!

66
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,098
{\an8}Choo Intae! Choo Intae!

67
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,351
{\an8}- Choo Intae!
Thank you, everyone!

68
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,145

69

00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,612
{\an8}Please, excuse me.

73
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,030
{\an8}Yeojin.

74
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,034
We will win the election!

75
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,834
- Why are you here?
- I'm sorry for intruding like this.

76
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,128
Can you please give me a moment?

77
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,671
We'll do this later.

78
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,388
What is it?

79
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,601
I intend to do whatever it takes
to support Mr. Choo Intae.

80
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,771
And being with the Democratic Party
won't change that.

81
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,691
Is that what you came here to say?

82
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,277
I admire and support Mr. Choo Intae.

83
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,862
So can you go out there

84
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,073
and declare
that you're Choo Intae's son-in-law?

85
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,494
Can you say
that you support the Innovation Party?

86
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,121
That you're done
with the Democratic Party?

87
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,335
Yes, of course.

88
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,046
Of course.

89
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
Yeojin.

90
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,092
I love you very much,
and I'm sure you know that.

91
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,847
I have this dream.

92
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,726
What dream is that?

93
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,357
There's a version of South Korea…

94
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,193
that I want to create.

95
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,490
Except that's not a real dream.

96
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,993
That's hypocrisy.

97
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,497
Hypocrisy dressed as a dream.

98
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,629
Thank you!

99
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,511
Choo Intae!

100
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,054
Choo Intae!

101
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,472
Choo Intae!

102
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,061
Yeah! You get that area!

103
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,861
Hey, you sons of bitches!

104
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,113
Hey, what the hell?

105
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,115
Yeojin!

106
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,534
- Yeojin!
- Why are you doing this?

107
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,954
Hey…

108
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,706
Oh, please stop!

109
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,634
Yeojin!

110
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,861
Are you all right?

111
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,446
Bring him some water.

112
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,954
Why'd you come back here?

113
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,415
To see Choo Yeojin?

114
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,419
- You said you'd date in secret.
- Yeah, but I still need to explain to her…

115
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,090
why I joined
the Democratic Party, don't I?

116
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,178
You came here to tell her that
with all these people around to see you?

117
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,307
I'm going to stop, starting now.

118
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,060
I've just…

119
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,563
promised Yeojin so many things
that I need to keep my word to her.

120
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,690
Yeah, and what about the promises
you made to me?

121
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,318
What, 'cause Choo is like your father,

122
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,570
and Samsik is just an uncle?

123
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,658
Who is he to you?

124
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,618
Who is he to you?

125
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,037
What has that man ever done for you?

126
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,124
Noble politicians. Yeah.

127
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,294
Were they able to feed their children
during the war?

128
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,548
Choo Yeojin isn't going to be
some politician's wife.

129
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,218
Why aren't you smart enough to get that?

130
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,638
It's still not enough to break things off
with her like this.

131
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,764
Why not?

132
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,018
- Because it's cowardly.
- Ah!

133
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,688
I refuse to let her see me as a coward!

134
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,942
So you want more money,
and you want more power,

135
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,695
and you want all this respect,
and you want to be the good guy.

136
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,738
That's not how it works,
you can't have it all.

137
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,741
Yeah, well, I quit.

138
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,493
You're clearly not ready for this yet.

139
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,790
I can give you
all the money and power you'd like.

140
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,459
But if you want to have
honor, love, and respect,

141
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,294
- then you're out of your mind.
- No.

142
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,505
I don't need any of that crap.

143
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,135
Will you just let me show you my plan now?

144
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,720
No, I don't care!

145
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,557
100 from the Liberals,
30 from the Democrats,

146
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,684
and 20 more to win over individually.

147
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,562
There'll be 20 newly-appointed assemblymen
in the next election.

148
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,523
Including you.
How many does that make? A 170.

149
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,191
- I said I don't care.
- With 170 assemblymen,

150
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,943
we could reform parliament.

151
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,403
Then regardless of who's elected,

152
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,989
the National Assembly
will be under Cheongwoo control.

153
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,741
We will appoint a prime minister

154
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,576
and that person will be you, son.

155
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,702
Who the hell…

156
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,206
in the Liberal Party would be
crazy enough to support me?

157
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,751
They wouldn't support you,
they would support Kang Seongmin.

158
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,837
Kang will push to reform parliament
in hopes of being Prime Minister.

159
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,132
Meanwhile, we'll make you
an assemblyman in three years.

160
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,552
And once the reforms have gone through,
we'll make you Prime Minister instead.

161
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,345
Now, think of what you really want.

162
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,097
The Reconstruction Project?

163
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,058
Do you want to be an assemblyman
or the Prime Minister?

164
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,478
Answer the question.

165
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
Huh?

166
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,449
The Prime Minister.

167
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,244
Then focus only on what you want
from now on! Focus!

168
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,122
I want to revive it!

169
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,959
I want the National Reconstruction Project
to go forward!

170
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,431
I'll break up with her.

171
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,316
In life…

172
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,695
when you gain something…

173
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,241
you're bound to lose something else.

174
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,120
You know that, don't you?

175
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,889
Please stay here.

176
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,943
Mr. Yoon.

177
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,737
Wouldn't we be safer
with the rest of the party?

178
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,365
Please… please, just wait a minute.

179
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,743
Let me just… let me go check it out first.

180
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,776
- Hey, who the hell are you?
- Stop right there!

181
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,321
Goddamn it!

182
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,365
I'm the boss, you idiot!

183
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,749
You piece of shit!
What do you think you're doing?

184
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,543
Hey! Actually,
we don't answer to you anymore.

185
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,670
What?

186
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,380
If you touch me, I'll kill you right here.

187
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,216
What are you going to do, huh? Hmm?

188
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,301
Are you crazy?

189
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,011
Go ahead, go ahead and try me.

190
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,057
- Go ahead.
- Yeah?

191
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,391
Just go.

192
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,518
I can do it.

193
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,605
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

194
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,066
Who the hell are you?

195
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,318
- Get out of my way, you dirtbag!
- Wait-- Ah, shit!

196
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,242
Snap out of it.

197
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,661
I'll finish it, get out of here.

198
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,846
Fuck!

199
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,239
Mr. Yoon.

200
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,224
- Were you hit?
- Yeah…

201
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,518
You're okay, Haejun.

202
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,936
Jongchul!

203
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,689
Haejun's just been shot! Jongchul!

204
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,067
Haejun, hey, it's okay.

205
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,777
We just got to get to the hospital.

206
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,032
Haejun.

207
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,284
Hey, Haejun!

208
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,453
Goddamn it!

209
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,539
Oh, Haejun!

210
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,249
Oh, fuck!

211
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,845
Please wait outside, ma'am.

212
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,974
Just a moment.

213
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,559
Oh, minister!

214
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,937
Choo Intae, he's just been attacked.

215
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,065
What?

216
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,900
Who's just been attacked?

217
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,823
He's in critical condition.

218
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,492
- Really?
- Yeah.

219
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,253
Critical condition.

220
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,589
What about Yoon Palbong?

221
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,883
He was found dead at the scene, sir.

222
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,809
Stupid fucking idiots.

223
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,861
<i>A witness says he saw Cha Taemin</i>

224
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,780
<i>from the Sineui Alliance.</i>

225
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,282
Yes. Ah, yes, sir.

226
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,284
We are currently investigating the matter.

227
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,954
The deceased
was a gangster named Gu Haejun.

228
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,498
Hey, look at this.

229
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,377
Hey, hey!

230
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,257
THE 4TH SAIL SALT FARM ASSOCIATION
MANAGER CHA TAEMIN

231
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,946
Hey, I'm your <i>hyung</i>.

232
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,116
I got it done.

233
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,453
Shit or get off the pot, all right?

234
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,664
<i>Hyung</i>, my ass.

235
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,585
Let's go.

236
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,170
Ah, jeez.

237
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,510
Goodbye, <i>hyung</i>.

238
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:44,808
AEMIN DAILY

239
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,643
Hi, good morning.

240
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,478
Oh, pardon me, sir.

241
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,113
POLITICS DEPARTMENT

242
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:21,470
Mr. Minchul, the son of Segang Textiles
CEO An Yosub, died in an explosion.

243
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,513
He'd been gaining notoriety
as the potential new leader

244
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,681
of the Liberal Party.

245
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,974
Who do you think is behind it?

246
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,187
Who stands to benefit the most
from An Minchul's death?

247
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,696
Kang Seongmin?

248
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,868
Ah.

249
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,079
Is this Taemin of the Sineui Alliance?

250
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,752
If this gets out,
it's over for Kang Seongmin.

251
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,644
Questions arise about Sineui Alliance,
the anarchist terrorist group

252
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,771
Unraveling Sineui Alliance,
the force behind Choo Intae's shooting

253
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,609
"The Sineui Alliance
does not solely target

254
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,195
leftist groups
in their terror attacks. In fact,

255
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,698
- there are also certain political--"
- They're implicating me.

256
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,366
They haven't named anyone.

257
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,246
"The power struggle
between this generation's politicians."

258
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,664
They're implying it.

259
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,835
- They printed this to attack you?
- It's Cha Taemin.

260
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,129
He's the only one who had this photo.

261
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,967
"The explosion in Busan is also linked
to the Sineui Allia--"

262
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,345
That's enough.

263
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,725
MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS

264
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,520
We will move
within each department and region

265
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,273
in order to amend
the Local Government Act.

266
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,775
Here's an outline of the voting process.

267
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,902
40 percent will vote early.

268
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,322
Groups of three, five, and nine--

269
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,949
- What is it?
- Take a look at this.

270
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,210
I'm sure you all saw the articles.

271
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,546
The situation is very serious.

272
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,883
But is it… even true?

273
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,595
You saw the picture.
Kang Seongmin did it. Can we agree?

274
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,639
Yes, it had to be Kang Seongmin.

275
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,726
Why would we have this meeting
if it wasn't Kang Seongmin?

276
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,020
In the event that…

277
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,731
Kang turns out to be a member
of the Sineui Alliance,

278
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,232
we need a contingency plan.

279
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,400
We need one now?

280
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,819
Mm, why make a big fuss over this?

281
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,696
If Kang Seongmin gets wind of it,

282
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,531
we'll find ourselves
in an awkward position.

283
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,701
True or not,
we ought to have a plan ready.

284
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,827
Listen.

285
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,247
I think we should look into this matter
more thoroughly.

286
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,000
Wouldn't it be
rather rash for us to suspect

287
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,170
another Cheongwoo Federation member
without knowing all the details?

288
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,631
I will investigate this
and do it discreetly.

289
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,343
Yes, sir. We have just confirmed
that it's a false rumor.

290
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,761
And the press fabricated the story.

291
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,516
Yes, Minister. Yes, sir, we'll be taking
the appropriate actions. Yes.

292
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,270
As for the party, sir,

293
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,439
they will take action
as quickly as possible.

294
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,066
True or false?

295
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,904
Is it true or false?

296
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,614
It's false.

297
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,367
Somebody's trying to defame me.

298
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,745
- Who?
- We're looking into it.

299
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,248
Is the Sineui Alliance
behind An Minchul's death?

300
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,751
I wouldn't know.

301
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,756
That's what it said… in the article.

302
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,300
That's all just speculation.

303
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:55,475
I expect Mr. An Yosub also would make
the same speculation.

304
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,565
What use are you
if the Federation… doesn't support you?

305
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,821
That arrogant bastard,
I can't wait to kill him someday.

306
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,992
Someone will overhear you.

307
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,918
Call Mr. Pak Jiwook for me.

308
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,649
Oh. Hello, sir.

309
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,860
S… Sir.

310
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,615
Hello, sir.

311
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,080
What brings you here unannounced?

312
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,292
So Cha Taemin, you haven't found him?

313
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,376
{\an8}JEON SOYONG
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY BUREAU

314
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,961
{\an8}He won't be easy to find.

315
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,796
What about the other Sineui punks?

316
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,258
Those guys have been inactive
for over 10 years.

317
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,553
You still got a list? Show me then.

318
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,806
And why does the National Assembly
need that?

319
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,183
Just show me.

320
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,786
10 years ago, we established
all of their whereabouts.

321
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,037
But we let them go.

322
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,206
- Why?
- No idea.

323
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,000
The director at the time told us to,
so that was it.

324
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,461
Our boys just pretend to look for them.

325
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,088
They're hard to catch.

326
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,298
And if we do get them,
we have to let them go.

327
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,141
Samsik.

328
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,768
Yes, sir.

329
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,149
Wait outside, Professor Hwang.

330
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,455
Kang Seongmin
and the Sineui Alliance, huh…

331
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,458
That true?

332
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,797
He and Cha Taemin did spend
some time together back in Busan.

333
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,591
Uh…

334
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,305
Did Cha Taemin kill him
or did Kang Seongmin do it?

335
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,518
I can't say I'm sure about that.

336
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,857
What are the campaign expenses
looking like this month?

337
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,528
Two million hwan
to the National Security Bureau,

338
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,697
three million
to the Ministry of Home Affairs,

339
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,782
and five million to the Liberal Party.

340
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,201
Let's stop all the transfers for now.

341
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,578
Yes, sir.

342
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,121
You go find Cha Taemin…

343
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,125
and you figure out who killed my son.

344
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,794
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

345
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,005
I'll look for him right away.

346
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,552
Mr. Cha Taemin.

347
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,181
Mr. Cha Taemin.

348
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,726
Mr. Cha?

349
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,740
Here, I've brought you some food.

350
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,951
Here's some whiskey too.

351
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,161
Oh, and…

352
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,331
this is for you. Uh…

353
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,585
it's a ticket for a cargo ship
leaving Busan for Shimonoseki in one week.

354
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,003
Make a note of the time.

355
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,798
Choo Intae…

356
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,342
is he dead?

357
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,263
We don't have any information yet.

358
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,723
Choo Intae…

359
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,104
I didn't mean to kill him.

360
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,523
Don't worry about it too much, all right?

361
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,942
Yoon Palbong is responsible for it.

362
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,069
Keep yourself hidden.

363
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,241
Is Samsik coming?

364
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,743
Of course.

365
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,713
What is it? What did An Yosub say?

366
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,384
He was asking
about what happened in Busan.

367
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,762
I'm getting anxious.

368
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,813
Yeah, you.

369
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,787
Where's Cha Taemin hiding out?

370
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,373
Why would you ask me a thing like that?

371
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,293
Kang Seongmin asked me to ask you.

372
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,547
He didn't turn up
at our agreed-upon location.

373
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,259
And where did you agree to meet him next?

374
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,472
And why is a National Assembly member
interested in such things?

375
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,309
Ah, must be a habit from your days
as a Japanese cop, I guess.

376
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,406
You're right.

377
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,074
Back when I was a <i>junsa</i>,

378
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,369
I should have just shot you
and gotten rid of you.

379
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,330
I… uh…

380
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,623
sorry… I'm sorry.

381
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,833
When is Cha leaving for Osaka?

382
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,503
Next week.

383
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,881
From Busan… on a cargo ship.

384
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,883
Where's his ticket?

385
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,637
Cha Taemin has it already.

386
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,889
Has he left for Busan yet?

387
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,641
I don't know.

388
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,684
Shit!

389
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,154
Bastard.

390
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,407
Are you all right?

391
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,327
Yeah.

392
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,332
Yoon Palbong…

393
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,878
got himself killed talking back, huh?

394
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,424
Take a look at the addresses.

395
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,845
I want you to tail each of these punks.

396
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,888
What do we do if we run into Taemin?

397
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,808
If there's a chance he's a threat,

398
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:53,935
shoot the guy.

399
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,981
Where do you think
Cha Taemin's most likely to show up?

400
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,942
I'd start off by searching
Kang Seongmin's property.

401
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,988
Is Taemin really…
that connected to Mr. Kang Seongmin?

402
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,365
Don't ask questions, kid, just go do it.

403
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,159
You know better than to ask about that.

404
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,111
Did you agree to meet Taemin at the villa?

405
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,779
- Yeah.
- Change the location.

406
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,745
Assemblyman, is it true
you were an active member

407
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,121
of the Sineui Alliance?

408
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,289
Can you address the allegations

409
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,124
that you're behind the death
of An Minchul?

410
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,461
You really think it's me in that photo?

411
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,922
I don't see the resemblance.

412
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,007
So, you're saying
the allegations aren't true?

413
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,386
Are you denying
involvement with the Sineui Alliance?

414
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,679
- Mr. Kang Seongmin!
- Didn't you say

415
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,598
you spoke to all the news outlets?

416
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,350
I did, but it didn't seem to do anything.

417
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,894
When I don't answer
one of their questions, it becomes fact.

418
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,690
Why haven't the Cheongwoo Federation

419
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,233
campaign funds come through yet?

420
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,528
Doesn't this mean
that Mr. An Yosub can't trust Mr. Kang?

421
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,030
You can't be serious!

422
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,117
Then explain why the money
they promised hasn't come through yet.

423
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,620
This is why Kang Seongmin
is untrustworthy.

424
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,665
There's no need for the party
to be so suspicious of me!

425
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,375
Sir, please.

426
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,964
Why are you all acting like this?

427
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,716
Just wait a little bit
and you'll get the money.

428
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,432
Those lowlifes, right to my face.

429
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,769
I'd go see Mr. An Yosub now.
We don't want additional rumors.

430
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,854
What do I say to him though?

431
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,359
Well, at the very least,
you need to go and beg him to save you.

432
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,904
If we don't get campaign funds
from the Cheongwoo Federation,

433
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,281
we might not be able to pass
the Local Government Act.

434
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,744
ILMO HOSPITAL

435
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,247
- Here he is now.
- Good afternoon.

436
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,082
We've been doing everything that we can…

437
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:03,041
Yoon Palbong found dead.

438
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,809
- Is Chairman Kim San here?
- Yeah.

439
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,940
San.

440
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,152
I introduced Yoon Palbong
to the Innovation Party.

441
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,322
How did you two know each other?

442
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,075
The army supply business.

443
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,952
It's weighing on me a little.

444
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,794
{\an8}Yes.

445
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,712
{\an8}- Good job. Here.
Yes, sir.

446
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,756
Looks good to me.

447
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,508
- Looks good.
- Okay.

448
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,635
- Okay, thanks.
- All right, it's nothing. Thank you.

449
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,261
- Enjoy the food.
- See you later. Okay.

450
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,764
Yes, right. Uh… thanks.

451
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,099
Oh, thank you.

452
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,226
Well, I didn't put in any extra for you.

453
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,812
Wait, but you're giving me so much here.

454
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,231
Huh? Hey, you need this much
to raise four kids, man.

455
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,524
I'll try to get you more next time.

456
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,109
Put that away.

457
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,486
Thank you.

458
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,738
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

459
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,080
Excuse me, where's Oh Inwoo's desk?

460
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,262
We don't know who sent it.

461
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,768
Is there other evidence

462
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,146
that he was an active member
of the Sineui Alliance?

463
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,774
It's not necessarily proof…

464
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,198
Kang Seongmin's father
also died in an explosives accident.

465
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,576
The Sineui Alliance is known
for using explosives.

466
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,619
And you know what else we found?

467
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,626
Why would Cha Taemin
want to kill Yoon Palbong?

468
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,171
The police report also states

469
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,673
that Yoon Palbong
was the first one to get shot.

470
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,385
It seems that Choo Intae
wasn't their initial target.

471
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,595
So, you're saying…

472
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,556
Yoon Palbong is connected
to Kang Seongmin?

473
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,892
I think so.

474
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,065
- Uncle Samsik.
- Oh.

475
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,358
Phew, you scared me.

476
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,777
Why are you here?

477
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,658
I want to get revenge.

478
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,624
You know who did it, don't you?

479
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,044
You know who killed Haejun?

480
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,296
Have you heard of the Sineui Alliance?

481
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,881
No.

482
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,760
They're known for assassinating
prominent figures,

483
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,303
regardless of their position.

484
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,512
I don't care.

485
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,223
They're incredibly dangerous.

486
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,307
It doesn't matter.

487
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,392
Oh, yeah?

488
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,062
There's something you need to do first.

489
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,481
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

490
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:20,696
Ilmo Hospital

491
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,890
Leave.

492
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,187
You should go and chase your dreams.

493
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,988
Sitting next to me
is the worst kind of hypocrisy.

494
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,791
Leave.

495
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,259
Leave.

496
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,726
Did you see the news?

497
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,271
Yes. Such a tragic turn of events.

498
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,984
Have you made up your mind yet? Finally?

499
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:23,986
Yes.

500
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,905
I don't need nice guys.

501
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,949
And we are waging a war here.

502
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,619
I won't tolerate any tears.

503
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,455
I've already shed all my tears.

504
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,791
I'm done with that.

505
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,668
Do you think you can beat Kang Seongmin?

506
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,629
I know that I have to…

507
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,257
in order to live.

508
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,629
Is the death
of the Seodaemun gang thug, Gu Haejun,

509
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,256
in any way connected to Samsik?

510
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,966
I'm really not sure.

511
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,301
What about the death of Dongdaemun
gang thug, Yoon Palbong?

512
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,554
As far as I know, it was a coincidence.

513
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,013
So it was a coincidence

514
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,224
that a Dongdaemun gang thug
joined the Innovation Party?

515
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,475
Yoon Palbong…

516
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,563
was known to hold
Mr. Choo Intae in high regard.

517
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,861
Samsik had something to do

518
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,113
with Choo Intae's assassination,
didn't he?

519
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,407
No.

520
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,410
It was an accident.

521
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,873
So, you're saying that Choo Intae's death
was an accident?

522
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,418
Choo Intae, Yoon Palbong, and Pak Jiwook.

523
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,753
A coincidence you say?

524
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,009
I'm not entirely sure
if it was meant to be or a coincidence.

525
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,764
I guess…

526
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,101
these are just the cards we're dealt.

527
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,412
Aha.

528
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,458
If it isn't the traitor, Jang Doosik.

529
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,795
Samsik, I'm… here to bail you out.

530
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,798
Your death isn't in the cards yet.

531
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,260
So how exactly
are you going to shuffle my cards?

532
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,221
Huh?

533
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,265
Uncle Samsik doesn't believe
in things like fate and fortune.

534
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,768
He puts his own plans into action

535
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,729
and he's extremely determined
to make the world spin in his favor.

536
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,524
If those plans are foiled,
he makes new ones.

537
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,655
That is the nature of Uncle Samsik.

538
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,411
Did I create the world we're in?

539
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,207
Surely, it's the world that created me.
