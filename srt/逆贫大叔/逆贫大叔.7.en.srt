00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,689
Faster!

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,621
Hey, Kim San!

4
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,958
Can you slow it down a little?

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,126
Kwangmin, hurry up!

6
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,133
Slow down, hey!

7
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,221
-Victory, sir!
-Victory.

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,434
Here you are. Well done.

9
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,939
Victory, sir!

10
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,358
Here. Well done.

11
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,610
Thank you, sir.

12
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,030
- Victory, sir!
- Victory.

13
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,580
Sorry. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,674
What are you doing?

15
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,808
I was gonna take these

16
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,559
for my niece, Jina.

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,816
I'm sure you feel uneasy.

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,901
No, I'm fine.

19
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,238
Don't worry about anything. Just study.

20
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,864
It's one of the perks of being away.

21
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,910
We're sending you off so you can study
without worrying about your family.

22
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,079
I'll keep that in mind.

23
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,292
How is your father's health?
Still very ill?

24
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,421
Yes, he's not doing well.

25
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,094
I'll give you… some money to live on.

26
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,138
That's all right, general.
Don't worry about us.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,642
Just take it and don't say a word.

28
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,855
Thank you, sir.

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,944
-Hey, take the rest of that home.
-Yes, sir.

UNCLE SAMSIK

32
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,984
FATHER VS. UNCLE

33
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,114
He's probably grasping onto Yosub's hands
and sobbing right about now.

34
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,908
Completely unaware he's taken the bait.

35
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,785
<i>I'm sure Kang Seongmin would be grateful.</i>

36
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,286
Yes, of course he would.

37
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,497
{\an8}He would have never imagined this role.

38
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,834
{\an8}That kid has been in the palm of my hand
since the day I bottle-fed him.

39
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,753
{\an8}Why are there so many US soldiers?

40
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,088
{\an8}<i>US soldiers?</i>

41
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,133
{\an8}Something doesn't feel right here.

42
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,640
{\an8}It seems most young officers
are in agreement with this declaration.

43
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,768
{\an8}There's also new intelligence
from the US Army.

44
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,317
{\an8}Uh, I will… be sure
to keep the military under control.

45
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,028
The Assembly can be bought…

46
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,947
but not the military.

47
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,199
The occupation taught us that.

48
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
What other intelligence was there?

49
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,661
The military looks set to appoint

50
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,621
a new First Operations Commander.

51
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,581
A new commander?

52
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,376
General Choi Hanrim is highly regarded
within the military.

53
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,962
He's also very close
with the US Army Commander.

54
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,592
Choi Hanrim?

Did you first meet
First Operations commander, Choi Hanrim,

58
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,858
-at the Albright farewell party?
-Yes, I met him there.

59
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,193
Is that when you discuss the coup d'etat?

60
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,625
General Choi Hanrim was the soldier
that I had the utmost admiration for.

61
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,794
He helped me when I needed it most.

62
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,342
He was just like a father to me.

Kim San.

67
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,698
Hello, sir, how have you been?

68
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,950
Is it true what they are saying?

69
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,244
I have joined the Democratic Party.

70
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,789
The political arena's difficult, huh?

71
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,083
People think
they're different from each other.

72
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,419
Eventually, they figure out
that they're all the same.

73
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,173
When they figure it out, it's too late.

74
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,466
I'll keep that in mind.

75
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,551
Shall we?

76
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,351
We both know too many people
admire General Choi Hanrim.

77
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,605
Do you normally like those
who are… admired?

78
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,399
They're just the worst.

79
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,735
Oh, there he is now.

80
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,489
Kim San is sticking right by his side.

81
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,450
Yeah, of course he is.
That's why we're here tonight.

82
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,452
General Choi Hanrim is here.

83
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,122
Do they look a bit too close to you?

84
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,332
You said that's why you came.

85
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,168
Well, it's not necessary
to appear so close.

86
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,129
He's like a father to Kim San.

87
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,966
Choo Intae is like his father.
Choi Hanrim is like his father.

88
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,677
Every man and his dog
could be like his father.

89
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,429
Is Samsik getting jealous?

90
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,931
Jealous?

91
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,937
Segang Textiles Director An Kichul

92
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,940
is here to deliver their donation
on behalf of the Cheongwoo Federation.

93
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,533
This year, we're sending
12 scholarship recipients to America.

94
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,703
Now please welcome my little sister,
Rachael Jeong…

95
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,538
of the Albright Foundation.

96
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,131
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Rachael Jeong
from the Albright Foundation.

97
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,385
First and foremost,
I'd like to say thank you for your time

98
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,762
and that I truly, deeply appreciate

99
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,639
each and every one of you
here with us today.

100
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,058
It is an honor to do what we do.

101
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,770
But without further ado,
it is my pleasure to introduce to you

102
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,148
the Albright scholarship program students.

103
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,985
Let's congratulate
our scholarship recipients.

104
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,740
Presenting, we have our Albright alumni.

105
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,951
Kim San, Jeong Hanmin,
and Kim Kwangmin to the front, please.

106
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,411
Attention. Salute.

107
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,723
Rachael, have you spoken
with the minister yet?

108
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,183
Long time no see, Colonel.

109
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,643
You told your uncle, right?

110
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,769
When I go back to America--

111
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,146
"Let us not become weary in doing good,

112
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,565
for at the proper time,
we shall reap a harvest

113
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,900
if we don't give up."

114
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,569
Galatians 6:9. Words I live by, Colonel.

115
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,280
As long as you don't give up
and as long as I don't give up,

116
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,575
I feel that all the seeds we've planted
won't go to waste.

117
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,577
You haven't told the minister yet?

118
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,580
I haven't told my uncle yet
because I feel that he'd be…

119
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,124
- disappointed.
- Mm.

120
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,878
Colonel, the Albright Foundation
has its eyes on you

121
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,673
and your level of patience.

122
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,299
Whether you're growing weary or not…

123
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,678
have some faith.
Imagine the harvest we'd soon reap.

124
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,722
I'll send your best
to my father and my uncle.

125
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,474
- Mm-hmm.
- Now if you'll excuse me.

126
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,147
- Uncle Samsik.
- Oh, Michael.

127
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,941
My little sister, Rachael.

128
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,484
Rachael, this is Uncle Samsik.

129
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
-Uncle Samsik.
-You've heard all about him.

130
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,946
It's a pleasure.

131
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,240
I've heard many great things.
It's nice to meet you.

132
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,575
Nice to meet you.

133
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,120
There's something very American about you.

134
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,664
Well, I am American.

135
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,999
Ah.

136
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,459
I'm going to take a moment
'cause of my shoes, okay?

137
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,128
-Ah, okay.
-Excuse me.

138
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,796
My shoes are uncomfortable.

139
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,214
I'll see you next time.

140
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,969
- Ah, Rachael, hi.
- Hello.

141
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,560
SEONYOOWON

142
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,904
Cha Taemin killed three of my men
and then ran away.

143
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,490
I assume you took care of the evidence?

144
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,118
Yes, of course. Burned every bit of it.

145
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,665
Oh, one more thing…

146
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,084
Yes, go on.

147
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,046
Uh, so, you know
how we had that big flood?

148
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,549
Well, a bridge was destroyed
in our district.

149
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,301
We'll discuss district matters later.

150
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,598
All right, well, fine.

151
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,768
I mean, you said, "Go on", so…

152
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,411
Excuse me.

153
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,871
Yes, miss?

154
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,748
Can you help me fix my shoe?

155
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,501
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

156
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,419
You want me to fix your shoe?

157
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,421
Yes, please.

158
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,719
Okay.

159
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,306
Actually… never mind.

160
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,100
I'll figure it out myself.

161
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,061
As you wish.

162
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,558
Excuse me.

163
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,935
Can I get a light?

164
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,482
Do you remember
the Battle of Nakdong River?

165
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,652
Ah, of course, I remember.

166
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,280
Oh, we were bombarded
for 28 hours straight.

167
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,823
What should I say?

168
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,958
I thought you were dead then.

169
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,168
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

170
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,044
And I thought to myself,

171
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:38,090
"What are these communists
doing here? Huh?"

172
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,634
I don't…

173
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,678
What is it?

174
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,556
Sir, you mentioned earlier
I should meet some of the Americans.

175
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,100
Of course, we're sharing war stories.

176
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,978
The commander here
thought I died at Nakdong.

177
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,731
Excuse me, sir.

178
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,066
-I hope I'm not interrupting.
-Nah.

179
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,902
Nice to meet you, sir.

180
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,321
Uh… you thought he died?

181
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,323
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, but you came back,

182
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,992
because… you saw some communist in heaven.

183
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,788
-Hey, that's a good one.
-Yeah.

184
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,500
As you said,

185
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,503
I thought I was a goner but I'm here.

186
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,171
Oh, yeah.

187
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,048
He is a funny one.

188
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,394
Sineui Alliance Charter

189
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,695
Who knew that Cuba would fall
under a communist regime, right?

190
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,489
Surprised everyone, I would say, sir.

191
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,868
It's people like you, General Choi,
who should be in politics.

192
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
-Are you thinking of running, sir?
-I'm not doing that.

193
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,248
That's foreign interference.

194
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,584
To bring up politics
to a military officer? Hey.

195
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,295
In the event

196
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,757
that South Korea really does become
a communist country…

197
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,176
Well, mm…

198
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,180
Uh… the general feels like
you shouldn't talk about politics,

199
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,224
considering his position.

200
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,810
And although he doesn't think that…

201
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,812
…South Korea could become a comm--

202
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,107
I believe that you're in my seat, sir.

203
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,109
And who are you?

204
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,737
Jason Arrent.
I'm a political officer at the US embassy.

205
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,906
Embassy?

206
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,867
Okay. Embassy.

207
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,536
Right.

208
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,506
What is it? Why'd you come back?

209
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,260
Well, a guy from the embassy said
that I was in his seat.

210
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,220
Yeah, but you could have
stood your ground.

211
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,597
Why'd you walk away?

212
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,098
What were they saying?

213
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,601
Is he getting into politics?

214
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,311
Is he?

215
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,064
Uh, well, he had said that…

216
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,859
in the extremely unlikely event

217
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,944
that South Korea becomes
a communist nation…

218
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,572
If it does, what?

219
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,491
Well, that's when
the embassy guy interrupted.

220
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,786
At the most critical second,

221
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,079
you got pushed out.

222
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,424
Do you remember me?

223
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,304
I do.

224
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,222
From the scholarship ceremony.

225
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,683
-Right?
-Right.

226
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,185
Lovely.

227
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,937
Very good memory.

228
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,232
I remember everything about that day.

229
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,693
Your National Reconstruction Plan.

230
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,946
I found it interesting.

231
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,906
Eye-opening, actually.

232
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,075
Thank you.

233
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,119
Do you really think it's possible?

234
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,454
Maybe.

235
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,459
Only if we open it up
and pull everything apart

236
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,127
to rebuild it from the ground up.

237
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,839
What's funny?

238
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,925
You couldn't fix a shoe.

239
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,635
You got to give it to me to fix it.

240
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,096
And if I do,

241
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,431
can you fix it?

242
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,523
A lot of people have lost money
from making investments in Cuba.

243
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,442
Why would anyone want to invest in Korea

244
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,403
if things are even worse here?

245
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,991
Um, South Korea is different from Cuba.

246
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,410
I can't trust the Korean government
just yet.

247
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,203
So…

248
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:41,667
are you saying that you're not going
to invest in our… industrial complex?

249
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,836
What more do you need?

250
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,505
Guarantee of payment
from the Korean government.

251
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,384
Right, yeah.

252
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,559
Are you… really getting into politics?

253
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,227
Yes, I am, sir.

254
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,187
Think you can beat seasoned politicians?

255
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,605
I will do my best.

256
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,486
Come and see me sometime soon.

257
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,322
-I got something to tell you.
-Yes, sir.

258
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,633
You're bowing to the rear end of a car.

259
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,094
What did Petron Harvest say?

260
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,346
They want a guarantee of payment
from our side.

261
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,182
Come on, we can't guarantee that.

262
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,851
- What a mess.
- Hop in. I'll give you a ride home.

263
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,102
- Stay in touch.
- Bye.

264
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,228
See you later.

265
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,030
Hey, you did all right.

266
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,120
Well, was it worth it
spending time with your father, Mr. Choi?

267
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,206
Wow, how childish.

268
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,751
You've got a father in every town, huh?

269
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,586
Not as many
as the nephews you have, Uncle.

270
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,796
Okay.

271
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,631
So what, you've been counting my nephews?

272
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,134
General Choi Hanrim is best left alone.

273
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,178
Why? Because he's your father?

274
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,597
Will you kill him if he is?

275
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,182
You act like I'm a horrible person.

276
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,642
Well, you said it yourself.

277
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,020
I guess so. I guess I did.

278
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,772
But that was just…

279
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,776
That was only in certain circumstances,

280
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,444
for certain reasons,
when there was no other way.

281
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,696
In each time,
didn't you get Cha Taemin to kill them?

282
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,118
I won't kill Hanrim.
I'll strip him of his rank.

283
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,120
Could you do that?

284
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,997
I've spent my whole life
doing that type of thing.

285
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,916
What's the plan?

286
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,421
I plan to go after Pak Jiwook
and use Han Soo as bait.

287
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,841
Then what?

288
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,928
Then Pak Jiwook could be the bait
to get Choi Hanrim, that's what.

289
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,639
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!

290
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,684
Kang Seongmin's ambition behind his push
for the Local Government Act amendment

291
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,768
Extra, extra!

292
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,937
<i>There will be an article
about the Local Government Act</i>

293
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>in tomorrow's paper.</i>

294
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,983
<i>Choi Minkyu will start hassling
Kang Seongmin,</i>

295
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,776
<i>trying to rush the election.</i>

296
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,029
I think the assemblymen
who are against the bill leaked it.

297
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,574
<i>How is it you still haven't
taken control of the party?</i>

298
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,576
I need this bill passed now!

299
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,662
-We still have time to get control.
-There's no more time left. Get on it!

300
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,788
<i>If we don't have the numbers…</i>

301
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,999
then forge the votes we need.

302
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,792
Get it done now!

303
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,216
What'd he say?

304
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,177
He said to get the bill passed now.

305
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,554
Right now, huh?

306
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,556
Can we do that?

307
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,936
{\an8}NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

308
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,939
This is just…
such a blatant abuse of power.

309
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,443
Why would you get
government workers involved in elections?

310
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,777
Because they're needed.

311
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,239
We simply can't agree
to such a ridiculous proposal.

312
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,741
It's just out of the question.

313
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,285
Hey, this is all for the president.

314
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,120
You say it's for the president's sake?

315
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,747
It's clearly for Kang Seongmin's sake.

316
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,304
I spent over 20 years of my life
serving in the police force…

317
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,390
and I realized…

318
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,272
everyone has got
skeletons in their closest.

319
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,149
And…

320
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
if you look hard enough,

321
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,199
you'll be shocked…

322
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,493
…of what you'd find in there.

323
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,083
I have records of the assets
you keep under different names,

324
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,253
records of the bribes from businesses
in your district and documents

325
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,047
regarding your kids
and the schools they got into.

326
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,177
I've got all the dirt, yeah.
Got it from the National Security Bureau.

327
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,306
When we serve Kang Seongmin,
we serve the party itself.

328
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,850
And of course, the president, yeah?

329
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,939
Kang Seongmin in the Sineui Alliance?

330
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,024
Are you insane, huh?

331
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:22,030
Each of you could be brought down
in a second, you idiots!

332
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,746
{\an8}SEONYOOWON

333
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,021
So, I've summoned all those assemblymen,

334
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,230
the ones who ran away.

335
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,775
-Well done.
-By tomorrow evening,

336
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,111
we could have up to a 180.

337
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,992
List of assemblymen in favor
of the Local Government Act amendment

338
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,076
Oh,

339
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,787
and those articles
that keep getting published…

340
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,376
I think that Samsik
is leaking information.

341
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,464
Who else could get
those documents from Cha Taemin?

342
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,258
<i>The Sineui Alliance ones
that were on the paper?</i>

343
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,719
<i>Let's just focus
on the Local Government Act.</i>

344
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,430
I'm suspicious of that Samsik guy.

345
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,058
I had someone follow that kid.

346
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,144
<i>Kim San, Choo Intae's son-in-law.</i>

347
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,562
<i>They spend a lot of time together.</i>

348
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,693
They even met with An Yosub.

349
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,905
You can't trust that guy, Samsik.

350
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,491
Where does Kim work?

351
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,951
He was
at the National Reconstruction Bureau.

352
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,912
Sir, I need to speak with you.

353
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,083
This man looks familiar.

354
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,168
Didn't you read today's paper?

355
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,714
Oh, I remember. I've seen him before.

356
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,605
What do you think?

357
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,981
Should I keep digging?

358
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,118
Hello?

359
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,245
Yes, he's here.

360
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,705
The call's for you, sir.

361
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,300
-This is Kang Seongmin.
-Assemblyman.

362
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,095
Ah, good, you're there.

363
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,974
Well, I've got something
to pass along to you. It's pretty urgent.

364
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,477
Ah, what should I do?
I make I could meet you there, I suppose.

365
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,814
-All right. I'll wait here.
-<i>Okay.</i>

366
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,903
Who was that?

367
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,698
Take good care of the assemblymen
who come back to the city.

368
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,199
Hey, who was on the phone?

369
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,785
Was it Samsik?

370
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,746
-That piece of shit.
-I'll take care of it myself.

371
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,458
You know what Samsik does, right?

372
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,710
Do you know
what Samsik is up to right now?

373
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,339
I said I'll take care of it.

374
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,133
Now go.

375
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,723
Goddammit.

376
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,163
What are you doing?
Get the car started, kid.

377
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,248
- Yes, sir.
- Watch it!

378
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,006
Here.

379
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,678
Résumé:
Kim San

380
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,807
So, An Yosub is…

381
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,060
is replacing me with Kim San?

382
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,773
Right, well, uh… it's absurd, you know.

383
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,858
This caught me off guard.

384
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,611
So, An Yosub
is still suspicious of me then?

385
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,785
Do you think that perhaps getting close
to Kim San would be useful here?

386
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:41,414
Just in case. That way,
if things get out of hand, I mean, I can…

387
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,709
you know, I can take certain actions.

388
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,173
Thank you.

389
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,342
Not at all. I feel like…

390
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,219
Well, isn't that what my role is?

391
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,516
Even if everyone in the world told me
I should not trust Uncle Samsik,

392
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,561
I'd still put my trust in you.

393
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,066
Then work on the Local Government Act.
You have to get it passed.

394
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,028
Yes, we need it passed
before 11 p.m. tomorrow.

395
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll make sure those opposed
stay completely out of your way.

396
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,416
Oh, be careful.

397
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,168
Uncle Samsik always got me out of trouble.

398
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,590
I'll work twice as hard
to make up for Yoon Palbong too.

399
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,425
Uh, have a good night.

400
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,802
Wait.

401
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,888
I need to relieve myself first.
You go ahead.

402
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,390
No, no, let me walk with you.

403
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,517
No, just go. Just go ahead.

404
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,775
Well done, sir.

405
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,154
Tell Han Soo to make sure
the guys are ready.

406
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,799
-Taemin?
-"The Sineui Alliance

407
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,510
opposes all authorities and powers

408
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,638
that are oppressing
the people and the nation.

409
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,556
The Sineui Alliance

410
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,310
does not hold power over others
for personal gain."

411
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,229
-<i>Hyung…</i>
-"We condemn philosophies,

412
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,899
people, and groups
who monopolize authority and power.

413
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,860
We'll prepare the weapons
and violence needed to enact this.

414
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,821
Proponents of suppression and persecution…

415
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,284
will feel the wrath
of the Sineui Alliance."

416
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,122
It's the Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct
that 16-year-old Kang Seongmin wrote.

417
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,333
You remember it?

418
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,503
Uh…

419
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,797
It was all Choi Minkyu.

420
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,715
I never sent people after you.

421
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,841
Kang…

422
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,886
Seongmin…

423
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,476
is the Sineui Alliance's final target.

424
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,853
No, wait! Just wait!

425
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,146
Give me a chance.

426
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,107
-What kind of chance?
-Whatever it is.

427
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,317
I'll do it well.

428
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,319
Whatever it is, I'll do a good job, <i>hyung.</i>

429
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,071
I can't…

430
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,615
I can't just die here.

431
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,034
Why should I?

432
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,995
Taemin, please!

433
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,210
You've got one chance.

434
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,338
I have my eye on you.

435
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,543
Oh, what brings you here?

436
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,086
I have something to tell you.

437
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,132
Over here.

438
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,099
Listen.

439
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,394
Are you in touch with Yeojin?

440
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,898
Why? You don't care about her.

441
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,114
Kang Seongmin's backed into a corner
and acting out.

442
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,742
He's trying to force
government employees to…

443
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,244
-to work the elections.
-Is that why you're here?

444
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,371
The articles are out already.

445
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,506
Why are you attacking Kang Seongmin?

446
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,634
There's going to be
a serious political reform soon.

447
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,636
After the election, that is.

448
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,139
And Kang Seongmin
will become Prime Minister.

449
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,141
And you want to stop that from happening?

450
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,810
I'll give you an even bigger scoop.

451
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,020
Oh, yeah, what scoop?

452
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,023
An exclusive front-page photo…

453
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,777
of an assemblyman hitting someone.

454
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,029
Kang Seongmin will now try to pass

455
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,323
the Local Government Act
under everyone's noses.

456
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,451
And when he does, you have to make sure
your presence is known.

457
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,453
You mean go up against Kang Seongmin?

458
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,914
Just as I thought, you catch on quickly.

459
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,958
We need him to get it passed.

460
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,043
His reputation
can't be changed with the Liberals.

461
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,629
That's it.
I have nothing else to teach you now.

462
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,089
And I will get in his way

463
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,925
and be thought of
as a champion for democracy, right?

464
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,887
FEBRUARY 24, 1960
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

465
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,889
{\an8}NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

466
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,140
Yeah. Are the Liberal Party members
on their way?

467
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,725
<i>Yes, sir. I have confirmed</i>

468
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,060
<i>with the ones coming back
from the smaller towns.</i>

469
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,562
All right.

470
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,316
Of course. Yes, okay.

471
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,574
I have gathered
10 of the strongest assemblymen.

472
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,035
One of them is even a former wrestler.

473
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,829
All right, I call you.
Just have them ready.

474
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,289
Oh, all right.

475
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,625
You think 10 is going to be enough?

476
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,627
The other side probably has over 100.

477
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,922
Sir, listen.
There's nothing to worry about.

478
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,840
It'll be fine.

479
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,276
All right, use that to block the door.

480
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,202
-Let's go inside.
-In there?

481
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,303
Two more rice wines.

482
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,683
Here, ma'am.

483
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,733
Oh, here it is.

484
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,318
This is great.

485
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,324
- All right.
- Cheers.

486
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,004
Thank you for making time, huh?

487
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,171
I'm actually very curious about

488
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,716
the National Reconstruction Plan details.

489
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,718
If you're offering to explain it
to us independents,

490
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,302
we would be very grateful.

491
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,304
Kim San, Economic Policy Committee Chair.

492
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,140
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

493
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,017
Great to meet you.

494
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,769
- Go ahead. Take a seat.
- Thank you.

495
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,355
Oh, no!

496
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,441
There's an important document
that I forgot.

497
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,694
-I'll start the presentation then.
-All right, all right. I'll be right back.

498
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,654
Okay? Stay where you are. Stay!

499
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,538
- Sir, what brings you here?
- Huh?

500
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,333
Uh… I seem to have forgotten something.

501
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,505
- Hello.
- Sir, you're here.

502
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,007
Ah!

503
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,552
You came. Oh, good to see you.

504
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,262
We can stay here, relax, have some tea

505
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,056
before we go to the National Assembly,
all right?

506
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,850
-That'd be nice.
-Oh, well. It's nothing too serious.

507
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,143
I just want to see you all

508
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,438
somewhere, uh, more quiet.

509
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,981
Oh, assemblyman Kim!

510
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,655
We partner with companies
who can transfer technology.

511
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,990
Within five years,

512
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,493
we project up to a million dollars
in exports.

513
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,455
He seems to be taking a while.

514
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,539
You're right.

515
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,541
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

516
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,170
- Let's get over there.
- We should hurry.

517
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,505
Yes, you're right, let's go.

518
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,801
- What is this?
- We're locked in.

519
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,302
Open the door!

520
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,930
Open up, fuckers!
Fucking assholes!

521
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,122
All right.
Assemblyman Lee Chungwon, are you here?

522
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,207
- Yes, I'm here.
- Ah, there you are, right.

523
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,252
Yes, sir.

524
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,295
What did he say? Come now?

525
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,588
Stand by for a moment.

526
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,673
Gosh…

527
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,800
Look at the time already.

528
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,137
Goodness, why is it taking so long?

529
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,055
Well then, bring me some whiskey.

530
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,141
He told me no drinks for you.

531
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,143
Who did? Samsik?

532
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,062
Hey, I'll deal with him.
Bring the whiskey over.

533
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,399
Come on, don't be like that.

534
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,319
Assemblyman Moon Kyungju?

535
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,446
- Oh, I'm here.
- Oh, right, yes.

536
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,448
Welcome, Assemblyman Moon.

537
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,451
- Come on, sir, that's dangerous.
- Hey, you. Get us out!

538
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,828
- Please get back down.
- What are you doing?

539
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,996
- Let us out!
- Just hurry up and climb back down.

540
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,831
Hurry up and open the door!

541
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,208
- Come on, you bastard!
- Open up!

542
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,463
Assemblymen.

543
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,216
What's going on over here?

544
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,595
Time to head home. You can't stay, right?

545
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,764
The Liberal Party is out there
trying to steal the election.

546
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,474
-Are you serious?
-What for?

547
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,643
The Local Government Act.

548
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,061
We need to block them now!

549
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,523
How can 4 people block 100?
It's not like we're Admiral Yi Sunsin.

550
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,150
That's abuse of power!

551
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,776
This is a fraudulent vote!

552
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,321
Wait, Assemblyman Kim!

553
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,947
We got to do something.

554
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,166
We can't stop these guys.

555
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,251
We need to call the Democratic Party.

556
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,920
- You're right, I'll make the call.
- Okay.

557
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,225
Assemblymen, to the National Assembly now.

558
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,563
Assemblymen, you all need to hurry!

559
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,066
You need to get to the National Assembly!

560
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,194
Hey, we got to go. Let's go, let's go!

561
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,035
Hurry. Come on, let's get moving.
Go. Let's go!

562
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,329
Ah! You're supposed to be
at the National Assembly!

563
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,580
You can't even stand up.

564
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,666
You thought this was a time
to have a little whiskey?

565
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,750
-You crazy old man!
-I'm going! I'm going!

566
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,835
What if Kim San ends up getting hurt
because of this?

567
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,128
Get out! Hurry up!

568
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,797
What's going on with you?

569
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,470
How dare you? I'm an assemblyman!

570
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,807
I told you not to…

571
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,074
Are we supposed to just watch this happen?

572
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,535
There are over a 100
Liberal Party assembly members!

573
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,495
Let's head in to vote on the amendments

574
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,080
to the Local Government Act.

575
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,499
I trust that no one has come all this way
to vote against it?

576
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,918
Let us proceed.

577
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,132
We need to stop them
from entering the hall.

578
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,219
-What do you think you're doing?
-How dare you try to steal the vote?

579
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,762
Just push through them.

580
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,431
Link arms now! Link arms!

581
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,474
-Hey, hey! Block them!
-This vote is invalid!

582
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,102
We are here to reject
the fraudulent votes!

583
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,229
We reject the fraudulent votes!

584
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,564
This vote is invalid!

585
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,691
What are you doing? Let go of me!

586
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,027
I'm rejecting this fraudulent vote,
Kang Seongmin.

587
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,155
How dare you touch an assemblyman?
Are you insane?

588
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,740
Yeah? Well, you're no assemblyman.

589
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,450
You're just Choi Minkyu's lackey.

590
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,993
Bastard!

591
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,786
Oh! Mr. Kang!

592
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,062
This vote is invalid!

593
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,523
We reject fraudulent votes!

594
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,110
This vote is invalid!

595
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,364
We reject abuse of power!

596
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,326
We reject fraudulent votes!

597
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,957
This vote is invalid!

598
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,555
What's all this? What happened?
Who did this to your handsome face?

599
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,599
Who else would it be?

600
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,018
Kang Seongmin of course.

601
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,357
You did very well.

602
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,984
I got it.

603
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,280
You're not seriously worried about Kang,
are you?

604
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,700
Of course not.

605
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,500
The rushed passing
of the Local Government Act…

606
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,044
I see you were very involved in it.

607
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,842
So, should we discuss the stolen election
of March 15th now?

608
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,928
Can we at least have a smoke first?
