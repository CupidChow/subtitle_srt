1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,800
I know.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Okay.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,040
Don't worry.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,570
It will definitely be fine.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,240
Boss lady,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,450
a bottle of vinegar.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,320
Rice vinegar or aged vinegar?

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,920
Aged vinegar.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,640
For dumplings.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,440
Okay.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,400
Boss lady,

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,600
your needlework

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
is really exquisite.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,320
I'm making it for my daughter.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,800
Good.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,200
Three fifty.

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,720
Okay.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,120
Coming right up.

20
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,440
Your bag.

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,930
You forgot your bag.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,170
What are you doing here?

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,800
What are you holding?

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,040
None of your business.

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,160
Let me see.

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,800
Come here.

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,360
Let go.

28
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,400
Hand it over.

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,200
What's inside?

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,920
Why hold it so tight?

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,000
Give it to me.

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,560
Give it to me.

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,440
US dollars.

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
Where did you get this?

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,560
A woman

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,050
left her bag in the shop.

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
She works at a bank.

38
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,330
My mom asked me to return it.

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,770
I'm warning you.

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,320
Don't get any ideas about this money.

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,240
Why return it?

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,120
Lend me some

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,039
to invest.

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,080
I recently

45
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,700
found a way to get rich.

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,600
With your incompetence,

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,920
you want to get rich?

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,170
Do you even know the exchange rate?

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,130
Who are you looking down on?

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,400
Let go.

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,490
I'm telling you,

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,400
if you talk to me like that again,

53
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,520
I'll tell your mom about

54
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,320
us stealing money

55
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,520
the year before last.

56
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,720
Do you hear me?

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,919
Here.

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,320
How can you say that?

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,840
I returned your money out of kindness.

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,500
Why are you pinning this on me?

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,640
I have records of my withdrawal.

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,280
Ma'am,

63
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,010
when you returned the bag to me,

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,860
it was short by five bills.

65
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Impossible.

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,890
I didn't even know there was money in your bag.

67
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,460
Let me tell you,

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,120
US dollars

69
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,320
must be taken to a bank

70
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,640
to be exchanged for RMB.

71
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,760
You deny it now,

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,920
but when you go to exchange it,

73
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,200
I'll still be able to find you.

74
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,840
I never touched the money in your bag.

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,770
I even had my daughter take the bag to the bank for you.

76
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,240
Ma'am,

77
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,100
let me tell you.

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Theft

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
is punishable by prison.

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,880
How about this?

81
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,010
If you return it now,

82
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,460
I won't press charges.

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,079
Fine.

84
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,160
How about this?

85
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,000
However many dollars you're missing,

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,530
I'll make it up to you in RMB.

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,850
Is that okay?

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,120
Fine, fine.

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,720
Xie Tong.

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
Feng Youning?

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,840
Why are you here?

92
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,640
I...

93
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm looking for my mom.

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,520
How about you?

95
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,860
Is this your house?

96
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Tongtong,

97
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,690
let's go.

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
My mom's here.

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,040
I'll hang out with you in a couple of days.

100
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,640
Bye-bye.

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
What are you doing?

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
You don't have to do this.

103
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,640
I really didn't know that was your mom's bag.

104
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,280
I beg you,

105
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,740
please don't tell anyone.

106
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,160
I really didn't mean to steal the money.

107
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't your parents usually

108
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,880
give you an allowance?

109
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,240
Look.

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to a competition soon.

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
I passed the preliminary round.

112
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,360
I plan to go to Guangzhou for the next round.

113
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,890
But my parents don't agree.

114
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Besides,

115
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400
the allowance they give me

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,240
isn't even enough for the travel expenses.

117
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,120
That's why I...

118
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,840
Forget it.

119
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,420
The money you took,

120
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,840
your mother has already paid it back.

121
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,640
My family didn't lose anything.

122
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't worry,

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,730
I won't tell anyone about this.

124
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,760
But you must never do this again.

125
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,240
So...

126
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,960
are we

127
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,320
still friends?

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
Thank you so much for forgiving me.

129
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm going to Guangzhou the day after tomorrow.

130
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,130
Did your parents agree?

131
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,970
I borrowed money from a friend.

132
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,400
Once I leave,

133
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,040
I might not come back.

134
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Not coming back?

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Won't you miss your parents?

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,159
My dad has never liked me since I was little.

137
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:50,720
Besides,

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm already this old,

139
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,320
but they still want a son.

140
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,280
Once the baby is born,

141
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,880
I'll be even less important.

142
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,170
I'm better off leaving now.

143
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
But you're only a freshman.

144
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,640
You're quitting school?

145
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,440
I don't like my major anyway.

146
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
And being a star is great.

147
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,720
It's so glamorous.

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,360
Better than being a doctor.

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Actually,

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,210
in this year of college,

151
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,440
the best thing was meeting you.

152
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,960
Me too.

153
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,120
Look at me.

154
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,720
Stop walking.

155
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,360
Come here.

156
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,780
If you had 500,000,

157
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,700
how would you spend it?

158
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,820
Buy the championship, of course.

159
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,040
What are you laughing at?

160
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,440
How do you plan to spend it?

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,240
Me?

162
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,480
I'd save it.

163
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,240
Spend it slowly.

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,700
You have to buy something.

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,930
I'll buy a tricycle.

166
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,940
You're unbelievable.

167
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,260
Yang Guang,

168
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
how would you spend it?

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,400
I'd take 30,000 or 50,000 first,

170
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,560
and have a blast.

171
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,440
Guang,

172
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,400
how?

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
Wherever the rich spend money,

174
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,450
that's where I'll spend it.

175
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,380
However the rich have fun,

176
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,240
that's how I'll have fun.

177
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
It's getting cold.

178
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,840
My mom knitted these gloves for you.

179
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,240
You're afraid of the cold, aren't you?

180
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,500
Remember to take them.

181
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,640
If she was indeed strangled,

182
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
then the suspect must be

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,680
left-handed.

184
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,640
Then who else

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,730
could gain Li Xueqiong's trust

186
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,960
and get the key?

187
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,240
Who is it?

188
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,890
Looking for something?

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,520
Dr.

190
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,920
Dai.

191
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,600
What are you looking for?

192
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,080
Dr.

193
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,520
Dai.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,330
Why is the stitching on this scarf and the gloves so similar?

195
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,360
Mom,

196
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,560
I'm here.

197
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
Time is almost up.

198
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,960
We're still short so much money.

199
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,490
Where are we going to get it?

200
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,850
There's still time.

201
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,050
Think of something.

202
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,040
It's 500,000.

203
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,480
We've tried everything.

204
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
Keep trying.

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,260
The police.

206
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,320
Maybe we should call the police.

207
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
They have both girls.

208
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,560
Even if we get the money,

209
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
who knows what they'll do?

210
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,050
Absolutely not.

211
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,200
If we call the police,

212
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,260
they'll kill them.

213
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
But in just a few hours,

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,860
we really can't borrow that much.

215
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,400
The phone.

216
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,720
The phone.

217
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Answer it.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,440
Hurry.

219
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,840
When will the money be here?

220
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,120
Do you want me to send you

221
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,600
one of your daughter's hands?

222
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,200
No, don't!

223
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,720
You...

224
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,960
Don't hurt her!

225
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,380
I...

226
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,320
I...

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,320
will get the money to you on time.

228
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,040
Don't try anything funny.

229
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,400
I want every penny.

230
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Do you hear me?

231
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,770
You'll get every penny.

232
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,240
Faster.

233
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,320
Faster.

234
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,730
The police station.

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,720
The road ahead leads to the police station.

236
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,800
Let's go to the police station.

237
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Why go to the police station?

238
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,640
We're going to the police station.

239
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,700
What are you doing?

240
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,920
Don't grab it.

241
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,720
Don't grab it.

242
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,920
Captain Zheng,

243
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,040
the bar's surveillance captured

244
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,360
the man Feng Tingye mentioned.

245
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,960
Actually, it's a woman dressed as a man.

246
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,290
She looks like Xie Tong,

247
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,680
but we can't confirm it yet.

248
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,540
Captain Zheng.

249
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,320
The pair of shoes at Li Xueqiong's place,

250
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
the killer must have

251
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,800
put them in her shoe cabinet.

252
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,600
All her shoes

253
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
show more wear on the outside than the inside.

254
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,480
But only that pair

255
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,800
is worn more on the inside than the outside.

256
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,860
It doesn't match her walking habits.

257
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,600
Where are you?

258
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,960
Where are you?

259
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
Where Feng Youning died.

260
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,640
Come alone.

261
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,730
I'll be waiting for you.

262
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,580
Auntie.

263
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,280
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,860
Captain Zheng.

265
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,600
Qingyang Mountain Warehouse.

266
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,480
Notify everyone.

267
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,600
Get ready to move out.

268
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Target location:

269
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,170
Qingyang Mountain Warehouse.

270
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
I never thought

271
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,050
the killer would be you.

272
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,600
Four cards.

273
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,880
Four victims.

274
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,840
You are the one who caused Yang Guang's death by the bowl.

275
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,000
You are the one who set the fire outside Ma Xiaoquan's tent.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
You are the one who led Feng Tingye to the warehouse

277
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,440
and strangled Li Xueqiong with your own hands.

278
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,280
It was all you.

279
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,290
If I hadn't seen with my own eyes

280
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,500
that you draw your eyebrows with your left hand,

281
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,660
if I hadn't noticed

282
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,760
that the scarf around Li Xueqiong's neck

283
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,020
had the same stitching as the gloves Auntie knitted for me,

284
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,100
and if I hadn't discovered

285
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,160
the secret of the cards

286
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,200
representing the license plate from Auntie's car accident,

287
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,900
I would never have imagined even if I died

288
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,050
that the one behind all this

289
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,280
would be you.

290
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,380
That it would be the one

291
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,700
who performed magic tricks for me

292
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,920
and grew up with me.

293
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,050
I certainly never expected

294
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,920
that our reunion

295
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
would turn out like this.

296
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,840
I wanted to kill them.

297
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,920
They deserved to die.

298
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,800
How could you use the scarf Auntie knitted herself

299
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,040
to kill them?

300
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,800
My mom didn't knit that.

301
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,330
I knitted it myself.

302
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,370
I wanted to give it to you eleven years ago.

303
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,970
But because of them,

304
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,380
I never got the chance.

305
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,400
But I still received it.

306
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,440
In this way.

307
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,640
Tell me.

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,930
Auntie's death,

309
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,319
the June 1st Case,

310
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
and them,

311
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,480
what exactly is the connection?

312
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,480
Every card I left behind

313
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,040
is telling you

314
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,680
what they did.

315
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,780
Yang Guang.

316
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,480
King of Clubs.

317
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,200
The mastermind of the June 1st Case.

318
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
He was the first one I wanted to kill.

319
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,450
Diamonds represent money.

320
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,880
Ma Xiaoquan took my mom's money.

321
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,720
He deserved to die for greed.

322
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,700
Spades represents violence.

323
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,530
Feng Tingye and his wife

324
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,800
burned my mother to death.

325
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,920
Hearts represents love.

326
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,930
Li Xueqiong loved Feng Tingye,

327
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,480
so she hid the truth for 11 years.

328
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,560
The killer who got away.

329
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,800
My mother who was burned alive,

330
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,720
and me, who survived.

331
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,780
For these 11 years,

332
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,160
I haven't gone a day without thinking about killing them.

333
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,880
Yes.

334
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,480
I am the murderer.

335
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,120
But on June 1, 2007.

336
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,680
Here,

337
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,240
in this warehouse.

338
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,000
I...

339
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm the victim here.

340
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
Before I go,

341
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,130
I want to give you a present.

342
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,520
Tomorrow afternoon,

343
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
can I take you somewhere?

344
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,120
Okay.

345
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,400
Youning,

346
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
what is this place?
