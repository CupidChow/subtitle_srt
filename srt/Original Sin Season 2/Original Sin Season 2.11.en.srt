1
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,640
How did you find the body?

2
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,320
Our factory is closing down.

3
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,240
My boss told me to go to the cold storage today

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,570
to check the inventory.

5
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,720
I was checking the boxes one by one.

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,020
I didn't expect

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,720
that inside that big box,

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,090
there was a body hidden.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,560
Among your cold storage staff,

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,920
has anyone suddenly disappeared

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,200
or taken leave recently?

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,760
No.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,720
Please leave your contact information.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,850
Then come back to the station with us to give a statement.

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Captain Zheng.

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,880
Over here,

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,160
there is a surveillance camera.

18
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,020
Go check it out.

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm on it.

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
Okay.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,090
How is it?

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,400
There are cracks on the surface of the body,

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,160
and

24
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,440
it has a waxy texture.

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
However, the specific cause and time of death

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
still need further verification.

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,560
There are no bloodstains in the cardboard box.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,240
The body's posture

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,440
doesn't suggest it was placed inside

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,900
immediately after death.

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
And his livor mortis

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,600
likely formed outside

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,260
before he was put into the box.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,760
Right.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,720
We suspect that

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,640
when he died,

37
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,960
he was in a low-temperature environment.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,200
It could be this cold storage,

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
or somewhere else.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,240
But I can be sure of one thing.

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,440
His body must have been frozen

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,920
before being put in the box.

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,560
Frozen?

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,680
Why?

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
First, his body is curled up.

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
This is a typical reaction

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,000
to low temperatures.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,920
And the most important point

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,440
is that there are no bloodstains in the box.

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
Normally,

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,500
even if the body was put in after rigor mortis set in,

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
there should still be blood smears.

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
But I checked the box carefully,

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
and there isn't a drop of blood.

55
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Dumping the body in the storage.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,730
And hiding the body for so long.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,800
It shows that the suspect

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,060
is very familiar with this cold storage.

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,760
And

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,250
their access wouldn't arouse suspicion.

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,480
Is it possible

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
that it was an inside job?

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,560
Captain Zheng.

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,120
Dr. Dai.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
I checked the surveillance footage

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,840
at the cold storage entrance for that day.

67
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,400
What the informant said is true.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,760
But the surveillance

69
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
only keeps records

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
for fifteen days.

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,160
Gao.

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Go and pull up

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
all the information

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,079
on the staff working

75
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,120
at this cold storage.

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,480
Also,

77
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,840
focus on checking who had the key

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,560
to this cold storage in March 2016.

79
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,360
And who was in charge

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,120
of this batch of goods at the time.

81
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,850
Understood.

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,040
Dai Yu,

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,160
you and Chu Mitang identify the body as soon as possible.

84
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,820
Chen Yishi.

85
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,940
Chen Yishi!

86
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,650
Here.

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,650
Once the body is identified...

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,320
Check the victim's network.

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,400
Also,

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
check if anyone

91
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,450
is connected to this cold storage.

92
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,050
Sun Quan,

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,740
Jin Jin,

94
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,880
you two,

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
come with me to canvas the area

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
around the cold storage.

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,280
He has abrasions on his upper limbs.

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
There are wounds from every angle

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,600
and every direction.

100
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,200
And there are ice crystals inside the wound walls.

101
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
It seems that while the victim was alive,

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,040
he rubbed against ice multiple times.

103
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Not necessarily.

104
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,399
Although there are ice crystals in the wound walls,

105
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,760
we can't rule out the possibility

106
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,480
that after he died,

107
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
they formed when he was frozen.

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,400
Look at these

109
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,040
abrasions and impact wounds.

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
They look like they were formed at the same time.

111
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,760
Then it looks more like he was

112
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,420
repeatedly hit by something.

113
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,250
And these injuries on his lower limbs.

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
It looks more like they were caused by repeated falls.

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,840
In other words,

116
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
he was likely struck by something,

117
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,130
hit repeatedly,

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,320
fell down,

119
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,300
got back up,

120
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
and did it all over again.

121
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Then why didn't he fight back?

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,010
He doesn't have a single defensive wound.

123
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:59,040
The corpse's lips and fingernails have already dried out.

124
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,600
It looks more like

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,060
excessive carbon dioxide

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
or nitrite poisoning.

127
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,690
Let's check the internal changes.

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,200
Dr. Dai,

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,060
should we take a break?

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,480
Dr. Dai,

131
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,880
are you okay?

132
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,440
Why don't we take a break?

133
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,040
I'll take the test report to Captain Zheng.

134
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,640
Okay.

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
Good work, everyone.

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,960
I ordered coffee for you.

137
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,720
Thank you,

138
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,580
Captain Zheng.

139
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,760
The body has been identified.

140
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,159
The deceased is Yin Haohan.

141
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,760
On July 10, 2016,

142
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,840
his wife, Liu Rong,

143
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,100
reported him missing.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,060
After the meeting,

145
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,360
let's go to the police station

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,490
that handled this missing person case

147
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
to find out what happened before he disappeared.

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,920
I've checked the cold storage staff

149
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,800
one by one.

150
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
Let alone holding a grudge against Yin Haohan,

151
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
they have absolutely no connection to him.

152
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,800
I also checked the staff on duty the week before Yin Haohan disappeared

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
and the delivery personnel.

154
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,840
I investigated them,

155
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,800
and ruled them out.

156
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
Based on the box the body was hidden in,

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
I checked that batch of goods.

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,840
The exact time that batch entered the cold storage

159
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,560
was March 8, 2016.

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,640
Three workers were in charge of moving the goods,

161
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,120
and none of them had any connection to Yin Haohan.

162
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,920
It wasn't until the recent

163
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,850
inventory check

164
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,560
that Yin Haohan's body was discovered.

165
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,820
On that cardboard box,

166
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,760
we only found

167
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,640
the fingerprints of the person who reported the case.

168
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,770
I suspect the killer

169
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,200
took the box

170
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,720
out of the cold storage first.

171
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
After putting the body inside,

172
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,920
they put the box back.

173
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,440
That explains why

174
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
there were such traces on the bottom of the box.

175
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,320
If the suspect went in and out with a box,

176
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
they would be less likely to be noticed.

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,800
Do many people have access to the cold storage key?

178
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,400
Yes, many.

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,159
The key is usually

180
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,600
kept in the security room.

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,800
And no registration is needed to use it.

182
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,080
When the guard goes to eat,

183
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
uses the restroom,

184
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,760
or goes on patrol,

185
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,040
the security room is empty.

186
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,240
So for anyone who wants the key,

187
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,700
it would be a piece of cake.

188
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,890
Understood.

189
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
I'll go see Dr. Dai.

190
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,360
Dai Yu,

191
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,120
the victim's family reported them missing.

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,640
There was an anomaly in the freezer

193
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
at that exact time.

194
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,920
Following this lead,

195
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,600
we confirmed the approximate time of death.

196
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,860
Don't feel pressured.

197
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,580
We'll find a way to solve the case.

198
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,040
But I...

199
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
can't determine the cause of death.

200
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,000
So I don't know

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
what happened during the death.

202
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,560
The truth is right in front of me,

203
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,920
but I can't figure it out.

204
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,800
I know.

205
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,360
I know.

206
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I miss my dad.

207
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
I feel like...

208
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm back

209
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
in that nightmare from the past.

210
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,960
Watching my dad...

211
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,250
Aunt Yun,

212
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,720
Xu Haishan,

213
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Lin Zhixiao,

214
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
and Xie...

215
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,080
I watched them, one by one,

216
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,810
die right in front of me.

217
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,970
But I couldn't do anything.

218
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,300
Their deaths have nothing to do with you.

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,760
Tell me.

220
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,280
Even if my hands

221
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,240
can feel so much,

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
what's the point?

223
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,130
I can't save anyone.

224
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Who said

225
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,980
you can't save anyone?

226
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,840
You said it yourself.

227
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,860
For the sake of the living,

228
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,020
speak for the dead.

229
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,160
It was you who ensured countless criminals

230
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,640
got the punishment they deserved.

231
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,120
And it was you

232
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
who gave countless broken families

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
hope for redemption.

234
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,560
I know

235
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
this is a really hard moment for you.

236
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,520
But we've been through such hard times before.

237
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,050
Didn't we survive them all?

238
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,520
I also know

239
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,980
it's easy for me to say.

240
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,040
But I want to tell you,

241
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,760
no matter what,

242
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,570
we will all be here with you.

243
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,090
Don't overthink it.

244
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,720
Give yourself some time.

245
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
We believe in you.

246
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,040
Everyone's here.

247
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Captain Zheng.

248
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,440
Have a seat.

249
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,640
You're finally here.

250
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,900
Have a seat.

251
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Everyone's worked hard lately.

252
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Let's have a small get-together today.

253
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,000
It's rare for Captain Zheng to treat us.

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Why don't you take a look

255
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,520
and add a few more dishes?

256
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,040
Captain Zheng is treating.

257
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,800
Let's toast with tea.

258
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Cheers.

259
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,400
Come on.

260
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
Cheers.

261
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
I have something to tell you all.

262
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,000
Dr. Dai

263
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,250
needs some rest.

264
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,560
She won't be back at the bureau for a while.

265
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,360
If there's any work to hand over,

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,530
Forensic Doctor Chu Mitang will be in charge.

267
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,460
When will you be back, Dr. Dai?

268
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,700
No matter when you return,

269
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,360
we'll be waiting for you.

270
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,240
Right. We'll wait for you.

271
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,840
We'll wait for you.

272
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,400
We'll wait.

273
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,960
Cheers.

274
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,320
Cheers.

275
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,480
The person who reported the missing person case

276
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,240
was his wife,

277
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,920
Liu Rong.

278
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,920
The couple

279
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
had been married for two years

280
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,800
and had no children.

281
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,920
They both worked

282
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,200
at the same real estate company.

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Yin Haohan

284
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,920
was in charge of engineering,

285
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,580
and Liu Rong

286
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,760
was in charge of sales.

287
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
On the night of July 10, 2016,

288
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Liu Rong suddenly came to the police station

289
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,240
to report Yin Haohan missing.

290
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,200
Don't worry.

291
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,460
I have a few questions.

292
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay.

293
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
When was the last time

294
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
he contacted you?

295
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,680
The 6th.

296
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,680
No,

297
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,640
the 7th.

298
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,840
I went on a business trip on the morning of the 7th.

299
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,970
He called me several times that night,

300
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
but I missed them all.

301
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,170
Did you call him back later?

302
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,000
I was out of town for those two days

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
for closed training.

304
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,720
It wasn't until the 9th

305
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,050
that I saw he had called.

306
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,680
But when I called back,

307
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
he didn't answer.

308
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,080
He usually texts me every day.

309
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,560
But

310
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,520
starting from the 8th,

311
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,440
he never texted me again.

312
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,720
I thought it was strange,

313
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,560
so I took leave and went home.

314
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,560
But

315
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
no one was home.

316
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,700
Were his things still at home?

317
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,080
Yes,

318
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,460
everything was there.

319
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,720
Before your trip,

320
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,250
did anything unpleasant happen between you?

321
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,920
No.

322
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
The 6th

323
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,460
was our wedding anniversary.

324
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,980
We went out for dinner together that day.

325
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,900
I even bought him new clothes.

326
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,130
Before I left on the morning of the 7th,

327
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,120
I ironed the clothes for him.

328
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,040
I told him,

329
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
"Wear this to work today."

330
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,840
Who would have thought?

331
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,760
When I got home,

332
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
the clothes were gone,

333
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
he was gone,

334
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
he wouldn't answer calls,

335
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
or reply to texts.

336
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,720
I looked everywhere for him,

337
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,980
but no one had seen him.

338
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
So,

339
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,960
the only thing missing is that outfit?

340
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,280
Yes.

341
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,060
Everything else is there.

342
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,250
So when he went to work that day,

343
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,040
he must have been wearing it.

344
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,170
Understood.

345
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,700
Do you have a photo?

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,060
Of that outfit.

347
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,840
Yes.

348
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,560
Look.

349
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,480
This outfit...

350
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,290
isn't it the one on his body?

351
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,240
What were Yin Haohan's social connections like?

352
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,400
Did he have any enemies,

353
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,760
or other romantic relationships?

354
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,080
No.

355
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,450
We looked into that.

356
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,160
His friends, family, and colleagues

357
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,800
all say that he

358
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,060
was a very kind person.

359
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
No one heard of him

360
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
having a grudge against anyone.

361
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,600
Also,

362
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,360
he was known for

363
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
being a family man

364
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,280
who loved his wife.

365
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,200
He just went to work

366
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,530
and came straight home.

367
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,290
He had no other relationships.

368
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120
Where was Yin Haohan's

369
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,440
last known phone signal?

370
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,520
Near Wenjing Road.

371
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,440
That's where he called his wife.

372
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,560
Wenjing Road?

373
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
That's about ten kilometers

374
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,640
from his home and office.

375
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,800
Did he have

376
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,840
any friends or family

377
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,300
or clients living nearby?

378
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,040
No, none.

379
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,240
We asked around back then.

380
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
We went to Wenjing Road too,

381
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
but no one saw Yin Haohan.

382
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,480
Plus,

383
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
his phone has never been found.

384
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
Did Liu Rong come to the station

385
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,960
to ask about Yin Haohan later?

386
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,600
Yes, she did.

387
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
She kept coming until last year.

388
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,720
But...

389
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,240
she's probably prepared for the worst.

390
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
A perfectly healthy man

391
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
disappearing for so long...

392
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,660
Anyone would guess

393
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,370
something happened to him.

394
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Yeah.

395
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,440
Captain Zheng,

396
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,900
should we ask Liu Rong to come to the station?

397
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
Jin Jin and I will go see her.

398
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
We'll fill her in on the situation first.

399
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,440
Once the autopsy results are out,

400
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
we'll ask her to come to the station.

401
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,580
Jin Jin,

402
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
have you contacted Liu Rong?

403
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,580
Yes, I have.

404
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,800
She's at Bailu Restaurant.

405
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,130
Okay.

406
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
We'll head over there now.

407
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,440
Okay.

408
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,840
Yishi,

409
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,680
you head back to the station.

410
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,120
Okay.

411
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,240
The cranium,

412
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,960
internal organs,

413
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,680
trachea,

414
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,480
these key areas.

415
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Also,

416
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,200
abrasions, frostbite,

417
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,440
and any parts you're unsure about.

418
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,200
In short, for anything you're unsure or doubtful about,

419
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,730
remember

420
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
to take samples of everything.

421
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,000
Then run pathological and toxicological analyses.

422
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,800
Dr. Dai.

423
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,200
I...

424
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,170
I'm afraid I might make mistakes on my own.

425
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Have confidence.

426
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,120
One day,

427
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,120
you'll be standing at the autopsy table on your own.

428
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
Call me if you need anything.

429
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,200
All right.

430
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,640
Hello.

431
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm Jin Jin from the Criminal Investigation Detachment of the Public Security Bureau.

432
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,090
You're Liu Rong, right?

433
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,370
We spoke earlier today.

434
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,600
Yes,

435
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm Liu Rong.

436
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I had a dinner appointment

437
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,860
and couldn't get away,

438
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
so I asked you to come here first.

439
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,780
What do you want

440
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,300
to see me about?

441
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,690
Yin Haohan is your husband, right?

442
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,720
Yes.

443
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,420
Why are the police looking for me?

444
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,050
Is there news about him?

445
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,880
Yes.

446
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,600
But...

447
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,200
It's okay.

448
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,880
Just tell me.

449
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,640
He's been missing for two years.

450
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,370
I'm prepared for the worst.

451
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,800
He...

452
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,100
he passed away.

453
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,280
Yesterday,

454
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
we found his body

455
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,620
in a cold storage unit.

456
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,840
I'm very sorry.

457
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,560
Ms. Liu,

458
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,180
the case is urgent.

459
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,370
To solve it quickly,

460
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,359
we need you to confirm his identity.

461
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,319
Is it Yin Haohan?

462
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
It's been two years.

463
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,840
I've been looking for you for two years.

464
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,160
Honey.

465
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,520
How is it?

466
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,840
It's practically made for you.

467
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,240
Honey,

468
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,080
you look so handsome.

469
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,760
Do you like it?

470
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,800
I do.

471
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Then,

472
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,440
trying it on is enough.

473
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,570
I'll go change back.

474
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,040
No way.

475
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,000
You have so many business dinners.

476
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,330
Clothes are your image.

477
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,000
My husband

478
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
must look handsome.

479
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,760
But their clothes are too expensive.

480
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,360
I'm a man.

481
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,960
Why do I need so many clothes?

482
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,280
But you,

483
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
my wife.

484
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,240
For this family,

485
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,400
you've sacrificed so much.

486
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,260
In this family,

487
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
the one who should dress the best

488
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,840
is definitely you.

489
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,560
In a bit,

490
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,400
let's go next door

491
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,280
and pick a few things for you.

492
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,960
Okay?

493
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,800
I know you're good to me.

494
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,880
But this time,

495
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,970
listen to me.

496
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,480
Okay?

497
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,400
Look how dressed up I am.

498
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,320
You have to match my level.

499
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,240
Okay.

500
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,400
I'll do as you say.

501
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,200
I need to match

502
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,040
my beautiful wife.

503
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,040
Okay?

504
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,400
Okay.

505
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,240
Hurry up.

506
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
I'll wait for you.

507
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:24,920
Sis,

508
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,960
you're so happy.

509
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,360
Thanks.

510
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,960
That's right.

511
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
He is my husband,

512
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,600
Yin Haohan.
