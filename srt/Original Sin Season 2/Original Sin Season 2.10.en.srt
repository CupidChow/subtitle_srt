1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,240
Why are you here

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,840
It's not him. It's him. It's him.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,200
You hit her with a brick.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,570
What if you kill her?

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,800
Guang

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,600
That's too much

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,640
Good for you.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,960
Five hundred thousand is not enough for years.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,720
Besides,

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,400
the more I invest, the more I earn.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
Just 500,000.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,720
Wait.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,400
What is it? What is it?

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,560
No.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,760
You can't just write it.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,560
If the police see this,

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,280
we can find out

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,240
we can definitely find out that we did it.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,970
I can tell by writing two words.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,240
You don't know

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,320
You've never been in there.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,960
They have many ways.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
What should we do?

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,530
Who can write it?

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,120
We can find characters to write on it.

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,440
It'll be fine then.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,440
If we can't find the characters,

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,240
we can't write it in a proper way.

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
It will be fine.

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,760
No wonder you're smart.

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
I'll do as you say.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
You're awake.

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,759
How is it?

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,759
Bricks won't kill you.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,330
Why did you tie me up?

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,800
Let go of me!

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Didn't we agree to tie her up?

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,800
I've brought her here.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,960
What do you mean?

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
I have an idea.

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,320
500,000.

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
It's not enough for the three of us.

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,880
We'll take care of your dad.

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,840
Another 500,000.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,170
Once we get one million,

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,840
Let's go to Guangzhou together.

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,600
I won't do it.

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
50,000.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,880
I want 50,000.

50
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,560
Since we've done this,

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,170
let's do something big.

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,600
A few hundred thousand each.

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,640
Where do you want to go?

54
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,600
I can do whatever I want.

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,320
Besides,

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
only 50,000 yuan.

57
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,240
If we are exposed,

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,500
you're going in just for a few thousand yuan?

59
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,039
It doesn't matter if we go in.

60
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,360
Can't we come out and do something?

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,520
But you're different.

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,980
You want to be a superstar?

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
How are you going to be responsible for this?

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,090
Get lost!

65
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Why don't you ask your parents for 500,000?

66
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,970
Why don't you ask his parents for 500,000?

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,890
Feng Youlee.

68
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,160
If you ask your dad for money,

69
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,220
you are the victim.

70
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,400
If you don't want her,

71
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
You tricked her here.

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,720
You're on our side.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
The police will arrest you too.

74
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,640
We've thought about

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,320
where to go.

76
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,450
He won't get caught.

77
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,280
What about you?

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
You have a competition in Guangzhou?

79
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,400
You haven't started yet.

80
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,160
You'll get caught.

81
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
That's right.

82
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,240
Think about it.

83
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,600
Guang.

84
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,840
Feng Youlee's father sent the money.

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,200
But

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,970
I can't get in touch with Xie Yun's family.

87
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,840
Did she call the police?

88
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,400
No way.

89
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,720
If I call the police, I won't be able to come back.

90
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
I waited there for over half an hour.

91
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Her mother didn't come.

92
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,130
The police didn't come either.

93
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,780
What does she mean?

94
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,240
Is she your daughter?

95
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,620
Let go of me when the money is here.

96
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,800
I said 50,000.

97
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,800
You...

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
take out my portion.

99
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Yours is here.

100
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,160
No.

101
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,079
Ma Xiao Quan.

102
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,200
Let's go out and take a look.

103
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,120
Wait ten more minutes.

104
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,650
If you don't come back soon,

105
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,460
Yang Guang.

106
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm talking to you.

107
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,600
Untie me now!

108
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,520
Untie me now!

109
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,200
Do you hear me?

110
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,520
Hurry up!

111
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,400
So annoying.

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,140
What are you doing?

113
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,079
Help!

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
Bomb!

115
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,240
Retreat 26588

116
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,920
Let's retreat 226588 first.

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,720
Inform the Explosion Team immediately.

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,850
I'll go find Dai Dai.

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,920
This is the truth you've always wanted to know.

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,160
If you knew from the beginning,

121
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
would you still be on my side?

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,040
I will.

123
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
If I had known

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,780
I wouldn't have let you suffer so much alone,

125
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,040
I won't let you

126
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,880
in the dark for so long.

127
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
I won't

128
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,400
see you risk your life.

129
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,400
I hate myself.

130
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,370
I hate myself for not becoming a police officer earlier.

131
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
That way,

132
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
help you

133
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,760
one by one.

134
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,360
one by one.

135
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,880
But I can't wait.

136
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,880
My death notice told me

137
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,090
I can't wait any longer.

138
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,880
If I die,

139
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,680
no one can tell my mom's grievances.

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
Xie Tan.

141
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,250
Let's go home first.

142
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,820
Let's cure the disease first.

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
Go home.

144
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,320
I don't have a home.

145
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,920
And are you going to use this handcuff

146
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,050
with this handcuff?

147
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,320
Dai Dai.

148
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,720
When I needed

149
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
and helpless,

150
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,640
Where were you?

151
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,720
All these years,

152
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
All these years,

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
after all these years?

154
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,760
Xie Tan.

155
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
Listen to me.

156
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,440
Calm down.

157
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,080
Dai Dai.

158
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
What you care about

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,360
is the truth.

160
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,720
And that uniform.

161
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,280
What about me?

162
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
Have you ever cared about me?

163
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,620
The one standing in front of me now

164
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,900
doesn't feel sorry for me.

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,600
who wants to take me home.

166
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,020
but the police who wanted to take me away.

167
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,640
Xie Tan.

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,880
Calm down.

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,409
Listen to us.

170
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Come back with us.

171
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,820
Living is more important than anything.

172
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,220
It doesn't matter.

173
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
My mom died on this road.

174
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,800
My life was ruined here too.

175
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,400
Get back!

176
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,040
Xie Tan.

177
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
I beg you.

178
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Please.

179
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,540
Stay alive.

180
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
Live, okay?

181
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,960
But I'm so tired.

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm really tired.

183
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,400
Mom.

184
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,500
I'm here to accompany you.

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,450
What you want

186
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,530
are all here.

187
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:57,960
Mom.

188
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,250
I'm here.

189
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,080
Guang

190
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,680
Guang

191
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,250
Someone's here.

192
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,320
Let's go.

193
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,920
Then...

194
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,850
What about them?

195
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,490
Let's go.

196
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,800
Xie Yun.

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,160
Xie Yun.

198
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
Say something.

199
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Xie Tan.

200
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,000
Untie me first.

201
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Xie Yun.

202
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,530
Did you hear that, Jing?

203
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,160
Xie Tong.

204
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,200
Xie Tan.

205
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Untie me.

206
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,540
Right here.

207
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,240
Xie Yun.

208
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,320
No!

209
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,160
No!

210
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,520
No.

211
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Thank you for the memory card in his pocket.

212
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,060
is Ma Xiao Quan.

213
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
in the ink box.

214
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,320
Don't let Dr. Dai know

215
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,250
Don't let Dr. Dai know about it.

216
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,800
I think

217
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,080
Xie Tan still wants us to know the truth.

218
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,240
Otherwise,

219
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,100
she would have put it in the warehouse and blew it up.

220
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,520
I just didn't expect

221
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,700
she would sacrifice her life.

222
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,560
Xie Tan fulfilled his revenge.

223
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,170
He must be desperate to die.

224
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,720
226. Yes.

225
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,520
Yes.

226
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,160
Dr. Dai.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,760
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,640
It's a magic about time.

229
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,320
A plastic bag.

230
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,000
Remember to come back to me.

231
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,319
Bye.

232
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,920
Mom.

233
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,760
I'm here.
