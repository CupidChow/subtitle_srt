1
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,400
No need to count.

2
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,920
It's 60,000.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,930
Where did you get so much money?

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,660
I exchanged it.

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,400
It's okay.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,290
Almost done.

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,560
Take this.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,370
I will definitely pay you back.

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,440
The surveillance camera picked a great time to break.

10
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,770
It's just making things difficult for us.

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,200
If we can't check outside, we'll check inside.

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,360
Even if there are clues in the house,

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,039
we won't know when they were left.

14
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,900
Captain Zheng.

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,320
Regarding Li Xueqiong's shoes,

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,039
the comparison results are in.

17
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,720
On her soles,

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,360
we detected substances identical

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,720
to those at Ma Xiaoquan's crime scene.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,320
From that small fire pit.

21
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,680
Plus,

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,400
the tread pattern on her soles

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,200
matches the footprint from Ma Xiaoquan's hometown

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,160
perfectly.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,960
Could Ma Xiaoquan's death

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,370
really be Li Xueqiong's doing?

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
Dr. Dai calculated

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,800
the distance between the body and the bed,

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,039
and the body's vertical distance from the ground.

30
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,440
Including the length of the scarf,

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,960
the numbers don't match at all.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,759
So,

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,759
the possibility that she stood on the bed to hang herself

34
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,690
can be ruled out.

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,759
So,

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,440
it's very likely Li Xueqiong died

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,640
before being hung up.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,160
The suspect killed her,

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,170
then staged it as a suicide.

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,680
Sun Quan,

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,700
what about the fingerprints?

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,360
We found three sets of fingerprints at the scene.

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,880
The victim's.

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,440
Feng Tingye's.

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Cheng Kangren's.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,920
Feng Tingye and Cheng Kangren's prints

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,560
were only found in the living room.

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,000
But in the bedroom,

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,840
nothing was left behind.

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,360
Gao.

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,200
Who did the victim contact yesterday?

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Li Xueqiong called Feng Tingye

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,240
just past 6 PM last night.

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,040
She didn't contact anyone else after that.

55
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,200
Cheng Kangren texted Li Xueqiong last night,

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
saying he'd go to her place this morning.

57
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,160
Cheng Kangren claims

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,640
he was home all night.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
But no one can verify that.

60
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,800
Have you reached Feng Tingye?

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
His phone is off.

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,320
But I contacted his lover, Guan Miao.

63
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,360
Guan Miao said he

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,000
left after 7:00 last night.

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,000
He said

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
he had business at the factory,

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
but we haven't heard from him since.

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,520
Okay.

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
Call the factory

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
and see if Feng Tingye went back.

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,440
Also,

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,240
contact the traffic management department.

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,300
Ask them to assist.

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,720
See if we can use surveillance

75
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,720
to find Feng Tingye's vehicle info.

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,160
Okay.

77
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm on it.

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm on it.

79
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,440
The results from the crime scene are in.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,330
There were no traces on the edge of the bed.

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,760
Hanging by standing on the bed

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,690
can be ruled out.

83
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,440
Although Li Xueqiong has only one ligature mark on her neck,

84
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,040
and it looks very much like a suicidal hanging,

85
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,400
I still think

86
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,200
she was murdered.

87
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,120
But if it was a staged hanging suicide,

88
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
shouldn't the ligature mark

89
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,040
show a clear difference?

90
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,840
But the current ligature mark on the victim

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,900
is consistent with death by hanging.

92
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,130
There is another possibility.

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,000
If you take a wet towel

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,660
and strangle someone with it,

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
it won't leave any marks

96
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,640
on the neck.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,560
And if after strangling them,

98
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,320
you quickly hang the body up,

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
the marks left behind

100
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
will look very similar to a suicide.

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Both methods of death

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,560
cause fractures to the thyroid cartilage

103
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,120
and the greater horn of the hyoid bone.

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,240
However, there is a subtle difference.

105
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
If the victim was strangled,

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,240
then the fracture on

107
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
one side of the hyoid's greater horn

108
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,600
will be more severe.

109
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,600
And in Li Xueqiong's case,

110
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,480
the fracture on the left greater horn

111
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,560
is more severe.

112
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
That means,

113
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,720
if she was indeed strangled,

114
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
the suspect must be

115
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,840
left-handed,

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,980
or someone with

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,529
limited mobility in their right hand.

118
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,040
Right.

119
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,760
There's another interesting phenomenon.

120
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,120
What do you think?

121
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,279
22. What do you think?

122
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,839
Do you think Li Xueqiong

123
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,040
and Feng Tingye

124
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
have a sex life?

125
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Feng Tingye doesn't even come home.

126
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,040
How can they have a sex life?

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Male semen was extracted

128
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,560
from Li Xueqiong's body.

129
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
The sperm motility is relatively low.

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,200
It was likely left by a male around fifty years old.

131
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,659
Could it be Cheng Kangren?

132
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're still running comparisons.

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,960
That day, Li Xueqiong

134
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,240
only contacted Cheng Kangren and Feng Tingye.

135
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
Could it really be Feng Tingye?

136
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,760
I just can't figure it out.

137
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,000
I really can't figure it out.

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Why would a man who wants to divorce his wife

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
have sex with her

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,520
while committing the murder?

141
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,640
So I think

142
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
Cheng Kangren is the more likely suspect.

143
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Judging by the traces on the body,

144
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,840
he fits perfectly with

145
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,960
our profile of the suspect

146
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,440
having limited mobility

147
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
in the right hand.

148
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,440
I think Feng Tingye has a motive, too.

149
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,160
His relationship with Li Xueqiong had broken down.

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,760
And there was conflict between Guan Miao and Li Xueqiong.

151
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,080
It's highly likely that after

152
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
conspiring to commit the crime,

153
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
he killed her to silence her.

154
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,800
If Feng Tingye planned all of this,

155
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,040
then whether for her dead daughter

156
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,370
or her beloved husband,

157
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,320
Li Xueqiong would definitely be involved.

158
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,240
You mean...

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Feng Tingye instigated Li Xueqiong

160
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
to commit murder,

161
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,600
while keeping himself out of it.

162
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,320
After Ma Xiaoquan and Yang Guang died,

163
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,800
he wanted to get rid of Li Xueqiong.

164
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,360
But Li Xueqiong wouldn't agree to a divorce.

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
So Feng Tingye killed her.

166
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,480
So their enemy

167
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,240
was their only emotional bond.

168
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,440
They didn't act like a married couple.

169
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,640
They were more like...

170
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,400
Teammates.

171
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,920
United against the world when there's an enemy.

172
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,840
But once the enemy is dead,

173
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,320
the bond disappears.

174
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,560
That is so cruel.

175
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,120
I don't think Feng Tingye had any feelings for her anyway.

176
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,180
He probably just saw Li Xueqiong as an ally for revenge.

177
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
If he really loved her,

178
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,900
he wouldn't want her doing anything dangerous.

179
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,040
But the fact is,

180
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Feng Tingye's mistress is pregnant.

181
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,520
He didn't want his upcoming new life

182
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,840
to be threatened in the slightest.

183
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,300
I think what you are saying

184
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
makes sense.

185
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,040
Okay.

186
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Xueqiong,

187
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,800
you need to prepare yourself.

188
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,120
Ningning...

189
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,280
is gone.

190
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,240
If you want your daughter alive,

191
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,920
leave the money here.

192
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
Don't call the police.

193
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,520
500,000.

194
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
If it's a cent short,

195
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,840
Feng Youning loses an organ.

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,760
Call the police,

197
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,240
and I'll kill her.

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,050
Is anyone there?

199
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Is anyone there?

200
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,540
The pattern is only missing one piece in the middle.

201
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
The arc.

202
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
What does it represent?

203
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,520
Cycle.

204
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
Reincarnation.

205
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,120
Fate.

206
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,090
What do the numbers represent?

207
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,760
Identity.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,160
What about the suits?

209
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,220
What do they imply?

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,240
Is the order of appearance the key?

211
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,520
No.

212
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,520
The pattern on the back is missing a quarter.

213
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,850
Of the four suits, only Spades is missing.

214
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,210
The suits must have a special meaning,

215
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,360
and there will definitely be a fourth victim.

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,220
Captain Zheng.

217
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,680
The semen found inside Li Xueqiong

218
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,160
belongs to Feng Tingye.

219
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
Also, we found traces of sleeping pills in her stomach.

220
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,880
We can confirm that

221
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,760
when she was attacked,

222
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,960
she was unconscious.

223
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,060
Captain Zheng.

224
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
The Traffic Department sent word.

225
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,800
They found Feng Tingye's car.

226
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
It's near the Qingyang Mountain Fireworks Factory.

227
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,880
Everyone,

228
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,140
change into plain clothes and follow me.

229
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,540
Captain Zheng.

230
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,400
I think I know what the cards mean.

231
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
Every victim's death

232
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
is related to the mistakes they made.

233
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,880
Clubs represent power.

234
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,480
Yang Guang masterminded the entire June 1st Case.

235
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,080
Diamonds represent wealth.

236
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,130
Ma Xiaoquan's mistakes were all money-related.

237
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,170
Hearts represent emotion.

238
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,640
Throughout the case, Li Xueqiong

239
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,170
was driven by her emotions.

240
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,480
And the corresponding Spade

241
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
that hasn't appeared yet.

242
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,760
Feng Tingye

243
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,840
has been subjecting Li Xueqiong to emotional abuse.

244
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
In other words,

245
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
Feng Tingye might not be the suspect,

246
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
but the next victim.

247
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,560
We just found traces of Feng Tingye.

248
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,820
I'm heading there now.

249
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,840
He's awake.

250
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,640
Cheng Kangren.

251
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
What the hell are you doing?

252
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,440
Last night,

253
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
what did you do to her?

254
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,680
What do you mean?

255
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
Why did she hang herself in the bedroom?

256
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,720
You owe me an explanation.

257
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,040
She's dead.

258
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,840
Feng Tingye,

259
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,280
stop acting.

260
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,000
I didn't do anything.

261
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,960
I was just discussing

262
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,280
our divorce with her.

263
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,960
Why didn't you cherish her?

264
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Why did you cheat on her?

265
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,880
Why did you get that woman pregnant?

266
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,840
What does that have to do with you?

267
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,160
Don't you enjoy

268
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,220
swooping in while she's vulnerable?

269
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,410
All these years,

270
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,000
have you started thinking she's actually your wife?

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Since I'm divorcing her now,

272
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,920
you should be happy.

273
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,040
Shut up!

274
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,120
Even if she divorces me,

275
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,280
she won't be with you.

276
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,760
You're a hypocrite.

277
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
In reality,

278
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,120
you're just blinded by lust.

279
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,460
What kind of Dao are you cultivating?

280
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
Why did you drive her to her death?

281
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,560
You want to kill her

282
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,520
and frame me, don't you?

283
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,980
Let me tell you something.

284
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,370
No matter how the police investigate,

285
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm innocent.

286
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,240
Innocent?

287
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,200
Do you really think no one knows what you did?

288
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,440
What did I do?

289
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,760
What did I do?

290
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,400
What did I do?

291
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,760
Eleven years ago,

292
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,320
dare you say you're innocent?

293
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,410
Get the fire extinguisher.

294
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,000
Get out of the way.

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,360
Move.

296
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,660
Watch out, Captain Zheng.

297
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Behave yourself.

298
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,900
Captain Zheng.

299
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,300
What are you doing?

300
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,800
Don't touch me.

301
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,040
I'm a patient.

302
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,460
Please cooperate.

303
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,930
Why are you pulling my hair?

304
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,370
What is the meaning of this?

305
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,320
Sun Quan,

306
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,570
when will the results be ready?

307
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,240
Four hours.

308
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,760
What four hours?

309
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,840
Feng Tingye.

310
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,880
You're involved in several murders.

311
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,410
We need to run a comparison.

312
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,500
Results will be out in four hours.

313
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,760
Murders?

314
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,080
What murders?

315
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Cheng Kangren is framing me.

316
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Why are you keeping me here?

317
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,720
Come on.

318
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,540
Let's get acquainted.

319
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,360
Then we'll go through things one by one.

320
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,020
Let's start with the past.

321
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,090
How did you find him?

322
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,360
Who is this?

323
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,620
His name is Yang Guang.

324
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,000
On June 1, 2007,

325
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,560
he called you

326
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,970
demanding 500,000.

327
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,960
Yes.

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,040
It was that bastard.

329
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,040
I've been looking for him for 11 years.

330
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,400
He destroyed my family.

331
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,410
Nice acting.

332
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,080
And him.

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,240
He conspired with Yang Guang back then

334
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,960
to extort that 500,000 from you.

335
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,290
His name is Ma Xiaoquan.

336
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,880
He's been to your shop.

337
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,170
Do you remember?

338
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,260
Where are they now?

339
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,720
I'll kill them.

340
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,000
You managed to find him before we did.

341
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm impressed.

342
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,740
Let's talk about something more recent.

343
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,280
Tell me,

344
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,420
why did you kill your wife?

345
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
I didn't kill her.

346
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
I haven't even been home.

347
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,280
We know that

348
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,200
you usually stay at Guan Miao's place.

349
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Then why was there evidence of you at Li Xueqiong's place?

350
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
You know that's my home, right?

351
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,440
So what if there is?

352
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,880
Do I need to report to you

353
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,360
just for going home?

354
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,280
Feng Tingye.

355
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,480
Watch your attitude.

356
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,360
You're sitting here now,

357
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
so you must answer my questions.

358
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,960
On the night of April 18th,

359
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,820
did you go to Li Xueqiong's place?

360
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,560
I did.

361
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,800
Then after dinner,

362
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
that night,

363
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,480
did you stay with Li Xueqiong

364
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,840
or with Guan Miao?

365
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,800
Neither.

366
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,600
Then where did you go?

367
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
A massage parlor.

368
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,280
Officer,

369
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,960
this is a legitimate establishment.

370
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,400
We don't have that kind of service here.

371
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,200
If you don't believe me,

372
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,280
go ahead and check.

373
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,000
Then could you please

374
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,280
pull up the surveillance footage from last night?

375
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,200
Sorry.

376
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,560
The surveillance system is updating,

377
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,620
so we can't view it.

378
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,960
Then take a look.

379
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,660
Did this person

380
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,640
come here last night?

381
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,640
Maybe.

382
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,080
But

383
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,960
there are too many people coming and going.

384
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,560
We can't remember everyone.

385
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,880
Thank you.

386
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
I didn't argue with her.

387
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,330
I just discussed the divorce with her calmly.

388
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,040
She was the one who got too emotional.

389
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,880
You knew she had mental issues,

390
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
yet you provoked her on purpose.

391
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,600
No.

392
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,160
I talked to her about divorce.

393
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,560
How did that provoke her?

394
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
I've taken such good care of her all these years.

395
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,490
Do you think it's been easy?

396
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm in my 50s.

397
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Do I have to spend the rest of my life

398
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,000
with a psycho?

399
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,480
So you strangled her.

400
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
I didn't kill her.

401
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,880
I just didn't want to live with her anymore.

402
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,200
Do you not want to be with her anymore,

403
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,260
or are you afraid she'll say something incriminating?

404
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,960
My leg hurts.

405
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,500
Get me a doctor.

406
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
A sore leg won't stop you from confessing.

407
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,320
Once you confess,

408
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,360
I'll take you straight to the hospital.

409
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,880
Then hurry up and ask.

410
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,610
You say you didn't kill anyone.

411
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,080
Then where did the videos and recordings on your phone come from?

412
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,640
That's not my phone.

413
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,170
Then why was it in your hand?

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Someone put it in the warehouse on purpose.
