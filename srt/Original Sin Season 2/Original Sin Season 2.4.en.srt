1
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,360
The person who copied the victim's notes

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,000
must have practiced calligraphy.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,800
You're right. You're right.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,040
There's no evidence. There's no evidence.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,520
we didn't find

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,520
who fits this characteristic.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,800
You should know

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,080
the investigation conditions back then

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,920
is not as perfect as now.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,520
All suspects

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,440
is based on interviews.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,480
It's just a rough check. It's not a big deal.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,210
We've searched for a long time.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,200
but there's no clue.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,640
According to the file,

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,760
the environment of the crime scene

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,240
is in a mountain forest.

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,170
This will make the suspect escape easily.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,360
Back then,

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,560
we spent a lot of manpower and resources

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,680
to investigate

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
the whole forest.

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
We also

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
the people around him.

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,640
but still found nothing.

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
The forest is rainy.

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,200
and the terrain is complicated.

28
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,600
It caused a lot of trouble

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,040
to our investigation.

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,600
Almighty.

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,240
Register first.

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,840
You have to write down your address and phone number.

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,240
Why should I register for a billiard?

34
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Who set the rule?

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,440
Our boss said

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,720
there's a thief.

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,320
All guests have to register.

38
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,400
Which school

39
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Which school is she from?

40
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
I don't know.

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,730
Thank you for the medicine.

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,520
Are you blind?

43
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,039
According to the information we have,

44
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,240
we can speculate that

45
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,479
the victims of the recent two cases

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,840
Yang Guang and Ma Xiao Quan

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,680
are most likely

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,520
is the escaped suspect of the Six Case.

49
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,640
Although there were

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,560
at Yang Guang's crime scene,

51
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,700
But he died from excessive bleeding.

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
And he was drunk.

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,039
I prefer

54
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,960
he died in an accident.

55
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,400
But Ma Xiao Quan's death

56
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,680
I think

57
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,440
there's a possibility of murder.

58
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,240
That's right.

59
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,120
Ma Xiao Quan's death was asphyxiation,

60
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,640
there's dust in his respiratory tract.

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,160
The fire outside the tent.

62
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,240
The wind direction that night...

63
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,370
These factors will speed up his death.

64
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,000
So,

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,039
if Ma Xiao Quan didn't light the fire,

66
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,920
but someone set fire at this time,

67
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,040
the possibility of murder is greater.

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,160
Judging from the situation at the scene,

69
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,040
it's a murder case.

70
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
are all possible.

71
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,520
But there is one thing.

72
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,730
the two escaped suspects died on the same day.

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,840
Could this be a coincidence?

74
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,920
If both cases were murders,

75
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
then the murderer

76
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,640
with Yang Guang and Ma Xiao Quan

77
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,520
and Yang Guang and Ma Xiao Quan

78
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,300
there must be a core conflict.

79
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,040
I think

80
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,040
we can start with the case of Six.

81
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,720
We need to figure out

82
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,320
the crime process of the six-one case.

83
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,840
there may be several suspects

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
and some related people.

85
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,800
But the more comprehensive we know,

86
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,600
the closer

87
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,079
the closer Yang Guang and Ma Xiao Quan's death.

88
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,320
Maybe their deaths

89
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
has nothing to do with the case of Six. That's right.

90
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,040
At least,

91
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,360
we can rule out one possibility.

92
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,120
or

93
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,810
You may even crack the cases back then.

94
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,360
It's rare that you treat me to a meal today.

95
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm full.

96
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
If Xie Tan didn't have a seminar today,

97
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,170
Do you think it's your turn?

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
You mean I have to thank Tong?

99
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the chance.

100
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,820
Is that Xie Tan?

101
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,760
Didn't you say she has a seminar today?

102
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,220
Who's that guy over there?

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,440
He's out.

104
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Dr Xie.

105
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Hello.

106
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Dai Dai.

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,130
What a coincidence.

108
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,040
This is...

109
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
This is my childhood friend.

110
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
This is Yuze.

111
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,440
from our department.

112
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,880
You two

113
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,410
We're in the same industry.

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,690
Nice to meet you.

115
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,520
Hello.

116
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,120
Which department are you from?

117
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,720
You're mainly in charge of living people.

118
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,180
I only care about the dead.

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,600
Besides,

120
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm a forensic doctor, right?

121
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,840
I haven't touched a living person's hand for a long time.

122
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
I'm not used to it.

123
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,480
Well...

124
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,000
Xie Tan.

125
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,900
I have to go now.

126
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,760
I know

127
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,690
I know what to do.

128
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,120
Let's make an appointment another day.

129
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,960
Let's talk later.

130
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,320
Okay.

131
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
Jin Il-seok called me.

132
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,640
There might be progress in the case.

133
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm leaving.

134
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,760
Bye.

135
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
What is it?

136
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
Why are you talking so happily?

137
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,400
We're just a colleague who fits each other very well.

138
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
After the seminar,

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
after the seminar.

140
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,360
Anyway, he's here.

141
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,560
I think my assignment

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,860
will be stable.

143
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,330
You start to talk in the afternoon.

144
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,320
Then...

145
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,800
Are you looking for me for dinner?

146
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,260
I've been waiting for you.

147
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,520
I...

148
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,880
I forgot.

149
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,840
Excuse me.

150
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,360
Is the weather changing?

151
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,120
Why do I feel

152
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,159
It's a little cold.

153
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,130
Are you warm?

154
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,320
I've been busy all day.

155
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,200
so I didn't have time to eat.

156
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
How about

157
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
Did you eat a bomb? Yes.

158
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:25,960
Director Fu.

159
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
We've checked the six cases.

160
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
and the current two cases

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
are rearranged.

162
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Sit down.

163
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
Director Fu 26588.

164
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
We seriously suspect that

165
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,320
Yang Guang and Ma Xiao Quan

166
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,440
are the fugitive suspects of the 6th case in 2007.

167
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
In the past 11 years,

168
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,400
in Jianglin for 11 years.

169
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,680
Although we don't

170
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,280
any more powerful evidence,

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,620
But their behavior

172
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
can prove

173
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,800
that he was involved in the crime.

174
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,280
It's only the first step

175
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,520
is only the first step.

176
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,440
We need to recreate

177
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,520
the whole case.

178
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,159
Clear the criminal links.

179
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
The place where the ransom was placed

180
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,650
and the crime scene.

181
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
from the crime scene.

182
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,800
The suspect is carrying so much cash.

183
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
without getting any attention.

184
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,720
It's really unbelievable.

185
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Besides,

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,000
of the suspect

187
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,000
of the suspect.

188
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Indeed.

189
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,040
And the surveillance coverage rate was not as high as now.

190
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,170
And the surveillance time is limited.

191
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
This brings great convenience

192
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,020
for the suspect to escape.

193
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,200
The time Feng Youlee's body was found

194
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,060
was five days after the incident.

195
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
This brings great trouble

196
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,080
to our investigation.

197
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,120
We are under a lot of pressure now.

198
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,400
But I believe

199
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,000
overcome the difficulties.

200
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,320
By the way, Director Yu,

201
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,520
Yang Guang's father, Yang Dayong,

202
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,640
is on a business trip.

203
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,760
We have arranged plain clothes

204
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,840
to guard nearby.

205
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,120
Once we find him,

206
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,780
we'll rush over immediately.

207
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,020
No matter what Yang Guang did,

208
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,800
you have to tell us everything you know

209
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,480
we can give you the truth.

210
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,240
At this point,

211
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
the child is gone.

212
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,160
What are you hiding?

213
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,600
I told you.

214
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,640
Yang Guang

215
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,360
It's my fault.

216
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,320
I didn't teach him well.

217
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,360
250,000.

218
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,360
250,000 yuan.

219
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,120
How many years do you have to work

220
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,159
to get the money?

221
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,320
I'm good, right?

222
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,200
How many days?

223
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,320
Done.

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,520
Son.

225
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
Tell me honestly.

226
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,970
Where did you get the money?

227
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,280
If I tell you,

228
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,240
Don't be scared.

229
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Lower your voice.

230
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,490
You always say I'm useless.

231
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,420
I've made you proud this time.

232
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,360
I kidnapped someone

233
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
I kidnapped someone.

234
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,040
Kidnapped?

235
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
Son.

236
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,600
This is a crime.

237
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,160
The police

238
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,160
will be sentenced to decades.

239
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,159
Is it that serious?

240
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,400
Dad.

241
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,559
What should I do?

242
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,559
Lower your voice.

243
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
From now on,

244
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,320
you have to listen to me.

245
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

246
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,040
Dad.

247
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,240
I'll listen to you this time.

248
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,600
Tell me honestly.

249
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,160
Who did you do it with?

250
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,250
Ma Xiao Quan.

251
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,800
Who is it?

252
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,200
Dae-woong.

253
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
When are you going to the city tomorrow?

254
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,440
Tomorrow morning.

255
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
Call me then.

256
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,440
I can

257
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
to do something in the city.

258
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
Got it.

259
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,920
Put on your brother's shoes.

260
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
If the police come,

261
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,650
I'll tell them you went out to work.

262
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,760
Cut your hair.

263
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
and wash your tattoo.

264
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,460
and get rid of your fingerprints.

265
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
After you get out,

266
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
get a fake ID card.

267
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,840
Let me remind you one last time.

268
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,860
Keep an eye on Ma Xiao Quan.

269
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,680
Okay. Okay.

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,000
I got it.

271
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,000
Yang Dayong,

272
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,800
I don't need to say more about your behaviour.

273
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,920
You should know

274
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,720
you're involved in a crime.

275
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,780
We're taking you back to the station.

276
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,120
As for your attitude,

277
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,940
will be written in the report.

278
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
As for the result,

279
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,890
will be judged by the court.

280
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,640
Sir.

281
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,640
Honey.

282
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,480
I really don't know anything.

283
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
Don't worry.

284
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,720
We will find out

285
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,290
We won’t wrong a good person

286
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,400
or let any criminal go.

287
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,640
It wasn't me.

288
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,080
I ran away

289
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,600
I ran away.

290
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,080
I don't have time to kill.

291
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,560
Is it you?

292
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,280
You were afraid Feng Youlee would tell the police about this,

293
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
so you killed her.

294
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,400
No, Dad.

295
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,560
Don't listen to him.

296
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,320
I...

297
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,680
I'm just thinking.

298
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,440
I just want to make some money.

299
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,920
Didn't you say I'm a loser?

300
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,160
You always say

301
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,560
I spent the money he stole

302
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,960
I just want to prove it to you.

303
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
You can prove it to yourself.

304
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,200
If you can't be sentenced to death,

305
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,130
I'll have to die.

306
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,160
I don't want to go in anymore.

307
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,720
Run.

308
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,920
Let's run.

309
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,520
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

310
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,200
Run.

311
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,560
Go as far as you can.

312
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
Where are you going?

313
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,080
I'll buy the ticket.

314
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,210
I can't buy tickets.

315
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,690
The police will check the station.

316
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,380
Let's take a shortcut.

317
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,360
and get a fake ID card.

318
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,930
We'll listen to him.

319
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
From now on,

320
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
you two are in the same boat.

321
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
No one can say

322
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,800
One was caught.

323
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,600
The other will go in.

324
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,130
Okay, Uncle.

325
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,160
Uncle.

326
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,740
Please take care of my sister.

327
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,560
Say goodbye to your sister.

328
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Pack your things.

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's go tonight.

330
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,400
Quan.

331
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
We'll take good care of your sister.

332
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,720
Don't worry.

333
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,680
I see.

334
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,740
According to Yang Dayong,

335
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,120
Yang Guang and Ma Xiao Quan

336
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,720
admitted their kidnapping,

337
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,760
but he didn't admit he killed someone.

338
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,000
But Yang Dae Yong thinks

339
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,200
even if he was kidnapped,

340
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,480
with the money involved in the case,

341
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,120
he will be sentenced severely.

342
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,800
Besides,

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,460
Ma Xiao Quan was in prison.

344
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,160
and didn't want to enter the palace again.

345
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,200
So the two of them

346
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
decided to run.

347
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
There were only the two of them at the scene.

348
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,960
Who was it?

349
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,090
killed Feng Youlee?

350
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
We can basically lock them up.

351
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,320
These two.

352
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,520
They could have done it together.

353
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,220
We need you to investigate this further.

354
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,680
The suspect

355
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,560
[If they weren't on the phone,] [they wouldn't have been on the phone.]

356
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,840
if they hadn't

357
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,280
in the phone,

358
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
made us believe

359
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,000
the suspect is a foreigner.

360
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,800
Now that I think about it,

361
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,520
They are really cunning.

362
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,680
They deliberately pretended themselves.

363
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,600
the way he talks

364
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,480
confuses the direction of our investigation.

365
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,800
This case

366
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,080
has also

367
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
to the victim's family.

368
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
Dr. Dai.

369
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,060
Ma Xiao Quan's phone data is back.

370
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,800
Maybe...

371
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,610
What a surprise.

372
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,760
This kind of video

373
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
Ma Xiao Quan recorded a lot of

374
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,160
What kind of method is this?

375
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,160
The scarf is tied up with cotton and quilt wrapped with a mummy.

376
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,000
What does that mean?

377
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
This is a special fetish.

378
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
This group often chooses

379
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,360
where no one is around.

380
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,080
Scarf.

381
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Bed sheets.

382
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,160
Cotton blankets and other fabrics to package themselves

383
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
to seek the pleasure of sexual suffocation.

384
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,920
The knot is tied in advance.

385
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,000
With the tape and moving assistance

386
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,880
Cover the bed sheets up layers

387
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,440
It's really done

388
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,320
So

389
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
Ma Xiao Quan died

390
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,360
in this process.

391
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,360
We've been investigating for so long.

392
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,480
How could it be an accident?

393
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,340
Captain Zheng.

394
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
Why are these two cases getting more and more complicated?

395
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,800
Suicide?

396
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,040
Accident.

397
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,210
Murder! Murder!

398
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,730
There's no definition.

399
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,860
Jin Jin.

400
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,010
Are you okay?

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm fine.

402
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,560
It's too slippery.

403
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,490
I didn't notice.

404
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,250
There's oil stain on the elbow.

405
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,080
Do you think

406
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Did Yang Guang fall down by himself?

407
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Did he touch something when he fell?

408
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
I think the injury is in here.

409
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,020
Chu Mi Tang.

410
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,940
Go back to the Inspection Center.

411
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,580
[Multiple bloodstains and murders]

412
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,120
Drunk?

413
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,480
The distance between the two wounds

414
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,000
is exactly the same as the diameter of this bowl.

415
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
The shape of the wound matches the tip of these two.

416
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,880
This bowl

417
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,010
is this bowl.

418
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,240
If the case is determined,

419
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,300
Was it an accident?

420
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,320
The 29th group.

421
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,340
Let's take a break.

422
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,160
We need to get the conclusion as soon as possible.

423
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,240
to settle the case.

424
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,360
Go on.

425
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,760
This time,

426
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,980
is the closest to the crime scene.

427
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,560
And this time,

428
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,280
is similar to Yang Guang's drunk state.

429
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,890
But the probability is too low.

430
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,480
We experimented so many times

431
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,320
to finally succeed this time.

432
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,000
Now we can be sure

433
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,580
the broken bowl

434
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,840
The broken bowl.

435
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,880
He fell on the ground.

436
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,540
And the bowl

437
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,359
stabbed his carotid artery.

438
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,560
If we don't have any new evidence

439
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,920
and a new suspect,

440
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,690
it could be an accident.

441
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,520
The first blood was on the table.

442
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,579
It's a blood stain.

443
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,099
It makes sense.

444
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,119
But if it was an accident,

445
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,359
how do you explain the moving blood?

446
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,880
His carotid artery was pierced,

447
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,280
he won't die immediately.

448
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Yang Guang found out he was injured.

449
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
he would find a way to save himself.

450
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
But because he was weak,

451
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,520
when he stands,

452
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,160
when he stands.

453
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,400
That's why it's on the wall.

454
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,560
on the wall.

455
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,920
Maybe he wanted to go to the window to get his phone.

456
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,980
and accidentally dropped his phone.

457
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
So he had to save himself at the door.

458
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,800
He was exhausted

459
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,760
and didn't open the door.

460
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,720
In a room full of blood,

461
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,000
Without destroying the scene,

462
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,080
without destroying the scene.

463
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,560
The biggest possibility

464
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,360
he was the only one in the room.

465
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
Maybe Yang Guang didn't expect

466
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,160
to escape for so many years.

467
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,360
the one who killed him

468
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
will be a bowl.

469
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,610
Isn't Ma Xiao Quan the same?

470
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,760
He didn't expect

471
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,360
the binding method of mummy

472
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,600
He's dead! He's dead!
