1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,760
At the time of the crime,

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,680
the killer took out a U-shaped sharp weapon

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,540
and stabbed the victim, Liu Ping.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
The victim didn't die immediately.

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,420
He struggled to get up.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,680
Then,

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,760
he rushed towards the curtains.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,560
The suspect approached him step by step.

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
He could only run.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,940
He crashed into the air conditioner.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,380
Then, as he gradually lost his strength,

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,420
he had to lean against the wall

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,460
and move forward step by step.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,740
He tried to open the door to call for help.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,840
But in the end,

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,650
he couldn't open it.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,490
He lost all his strength

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
and died from excessive blood loss.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,440
But there's a problem with that deduction.

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,500
Given the victim's state at the time,

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,640
when he got up,

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,800
he should have immediately lunged for the nearest object.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,130
Why did he rush straight for the curtains?

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,100
Could it be that

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,380
there was something he wanted over by the curtains?

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Dr. Dai,

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,240
you're just in time.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
What's wrong?

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
The phone you and Captain Zheng found at Liu Ping's home,

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
on the AC outdoor unit,

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,520
likely belongs to Liu Ping himself.

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,680
I checked the call records.

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,320
There's a number contacted most frequently,

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,600
and I've already pinpointed its location.

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,880
It was also the last person to contact the deceased before the incident,

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,360
so I was just about to go find him.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,690
Okay.

38
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,960
Where is Captain Zheng?

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,600
He's out on field duty.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
I called him just now.

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,680
He told us to go ahead.

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,079
Okay.

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,420
That's the forest for you.

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,079
The weather changes so suddenly.

45
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,400
Put on your hats.

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,460
So many variables.

47
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,280
The phone signal shows it's right here.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,000
Call it.

49
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,200
Dr. Dai.

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
When will Captain Zheng arrive?

51
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,520
What is it?

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,420
Inside here...

53
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,740
It looks like a person.

54
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,020
Captain Zheng.

55
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,370
The victim's ID.

56
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,770
Thanks, Dr. Dai.

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,640
It's wrapped in seven or eight layers.

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,500
I need to take the body back to the forensics center.

59
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,400
We still have no leads on the one who died at dawn,

60
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
and now there's another one.

61
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,290
And this.

62
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,440
Song Sijun.

63
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,760
Isn't he the guy from Liu Ping's ticket info?

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,080
Yes.

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,700
There must be a connection between them.

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
Alright, I'm heading out.

67
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,720
Thanks.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,400
Liu,

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,330
pack up the tent.

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,840
Okay.

71
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,440
Gao,

72
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,800
how is it?

73
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,659
Captain Zheng.

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,840
To be honest,

75
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
in all my years on the force,

76
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,200
this is the first time I've seen such a complex

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,400
and bizarre death.

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
So, judging by the current situation,

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
is it hard to determine

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,370
whether it's homicide or suicide?

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,840
Everyone,

82
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,200
stop what you're doing

83
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,260
and come over here.

84
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,140
Captain Zheng,

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,020
did you find anything?

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
This motorcycle is pretty beat up.

87
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,560
But as for specific usage traces,

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
we'll have to test it back at the station.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where's Sun Quan?

90
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,720
We found a phone at the scene,

91
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
but the motherboard is damaged.

92
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,960
We just checked, too.

93
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
The route in and out of the woods

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,610
is just this one.

95
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
The heavy rain

96
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,720
washed away

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,640
all traces except for the victim's.

98
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
But I hope you won't get discouraged.

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,720
I believe,

100
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,320
as long as we check carefully

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,880
and don't miss a single detail.

102
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,409
We'll definitely find overlooked evidence.

103
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Pink teeth.

104
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,940
Find anything on your end?

105
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,600
No other external injuries found.

106
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
With the deceased's hands bound

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
behind his back,

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,400
it's impossible to tie such knots.

109
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,159
To make a grown man of 1.8 meters

110
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,120
and 65 kilograms

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,440
submit without a fight,

112
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,120
the best way

113
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,480
is to drug him.

114
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,210
Okay.

115
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,440
Let's check for internal injuries.

116
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,770
Okay.

117
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,600
The thymus and cardiopulmonary serosa

118
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,960
show petechial hemorrhages.

119
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,680
Tardieu spots.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,640
Asphyxia.

121
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Not necessarily.

122
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,720
Arsenic poisoning,

123
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,440
phosphorus poisoning,

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
and acute alcohol poisoning

125
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,540
can all cause this.

126
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,880
Open it wider.

127
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,240
It must be asphyxiation

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,100
that caused his spleen to shrink.

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,160
It's obviously much lighter

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,280
than a normal person's.

131
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,740
The color is lighter, too.

132
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,080
I suspect

133
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,760
the asphyxiation process

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,620
was quite long.

135
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
You didn't go home last night.

136
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,370
Did your wife say anything?

137
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,280
What could she say?

138
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
She just took care of the kid alone.

139
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,530
She's used to it.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,400
By the way,

141
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,930
Sun Quan.

142
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,460
How about that phone from last night?

143
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,600
The motherboard's fried.

144
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,559
The technical department is still working on it.

145
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,820
It will take some time.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,860
Captain Zheng,

147
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,000
the preliminary examination shows

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,480
that the time of death

149
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,880
was around the night of April 5th,

150
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,799
at about 9:00 PM.

151
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,600
Nine o'clock.

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,520
What's wrong?

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I smelled it at the time.

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,480
There was a smoky smell at the tent entrance.

155
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,080
I also checked all the wind directions

156
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
from that night.

157
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,220
Between 8:00 and 10:00 PM,

158
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,440
there was a northwest wind.

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,770
And the tent was exactly

160
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
20 meters southeast of the fire.

161
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Do we have results

162
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
on the preliminary cause of death?

163
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
The victim's cause of death

164
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,680
was asphyxiation caused by

165
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,540
compression of the chest cavity.

166
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,840
He remained in a hypoxic state for a long time.

167
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,200
In addition, in his respiratory tract,

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,520
we found traces of soot.

169
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,320
It is very likely that

170
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,040
the soot accelerated

171
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,640
his death.

172
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Then the clue about the fire pit is very important.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,260
Gao.

174
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,760
Yes.

175
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,600
The clue about the fire pit,

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,560
you found it.

177
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,720
Keep following up.

178
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,400
Be thorough.

179
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,480
See if you can find out

180
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,760
whether the fire was set by the victim

181
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,690
or someone else.

182
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,600
You've all worked hard staying up all night.

183
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I asked Chen Yishi

184
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,500
to bring breakfast for everyone.

185
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,440
Here he is.

186
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,960
Breakfast.

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,120
See what you'd like.

188
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,180
Speak of the devil.

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,240
Hurry up.

190
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,700
Thanks for your hard work.

191
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,960
It's wrapped in so many layers.

192
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
It's quite complicated.

193
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,400
Is it murder

194
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,360
or suicide?

195
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,650
His hands were tied.

196
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,840
Such a complex procedure

197
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,640
doesn't look like something he could do alone.

198
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,080
Look.

199
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,560
This towel

200
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,480
is just like the stockings on the victim,

201
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,010
as well as the curtains.

202
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,700
When these fabrics

203
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,880
were wrapped around the victim,

204
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,600
layer by layer,

205
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,260
getting tighter and tighter,

206
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,200
the victim's internal organs

207
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,400
would be compressed.

208
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,600
Plus, the tent's ventilation

209
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,860
was poor to begin with.

210
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,560
So,

211
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,920
the victim's breathing

212
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,400
became increasingly difficult,

213
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,960
eventually leading to suffocation.

214
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,800
By the way, Sun Quan.

215
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,960
Inside the victim's tent,

216
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,680
did you find

217
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
any biological evidence of a second person?

218
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,600
No.

219
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,680
Inside and out,

220
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
there were only the victim's fingerprints.

221
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,320
That tent

222
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,080
must be the primary crime scene.

223
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,960
But he showed no signs of struggle.

224
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Could he have been poisoned

225
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
or drugged?

226
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,480
Neither.

227
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,840
He was fully conscious

228
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
when his hands were tied.

229
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,640
He went from breathing normally

230
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,900
to a near-death state.

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,730
In that case,

232
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,120
it's very likely a homicide.

233
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,020
Captain Zheng.

234
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,160
We've identified the victim in the tent.

235
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,320
His name isn't Song Sijun.

236
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
His real name is Ma Xiaoquan.

237
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,720
In 2005,

238
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,000
he was sent to a labor camp for theft.

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
The theft took place at Tianwaitian Pool Hall.

240
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,640
The theft took place at Tianwaitian Pool Hall.

241
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,240
The theft took place at Tianwaitian Pool Hall.

242
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Ma Xiaoquan,

243
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,730
from Sheqi Village.

244
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
He also has a sister named Ma Xiaoxi.

245
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,090
His parents died early.

246
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
I found surveillance footage...

247
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,680
...of Ma Xiaoquan's motorcycle.

248
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,440
It drove away from the scene

249
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
of the April 5th Case.

250
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:23,880
So the victims of the two murders...

251
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,520
So the victims of both murders

252
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,440
likely live in the same neighborhood.

253
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,570
Is it a coincidence?

254
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,890
I don't think so.

255
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,520
They appeared in the same neighborhood.

256
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,800
As for the time of death,

257
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,560
one was early morning on April 5th,

258
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,160
and the other was that night.

259
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,930
The two cases happened so close together.

260
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,720
It's not that simple.

261
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,620
Listen.

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Let's go to that neighborhood right now.

263
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,330
Then went to find Ma Xiaoxi.

264
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,690
Have you seen

265
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,800
this motorcycle?

266
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,120
This is an old neighborhood.

267
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,520
People park wherever they want.

268
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,720
I wouldn't remember.

269
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,040
Does Song Sijun

270
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,840
live here too?

271
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,840
Yes,

272
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,040
Officer.

273
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,090
Has something happened again?

274
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,140
Routine check.

275
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
Please open the door.

276
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,040
Oh.

277
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,520
Don't come in.

278
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
Why won't this door open?

279
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,040
The landlord locked it on purpose.

280
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,160
He doesn't want it opened.

281
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,690
I don't have the key either.

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,340
There's so much food stored here.

283
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,120
The dishes,

284
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,120
the bowls,

285
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,810
are identical to the ones at the April 5th Case scene.

286
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,140
Captain Zheng.

287
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,130
They're all train tickets.

288
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
And the destinations Liu Ping was going to

289
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
are exactly the same.

290
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,360
Based on the clues we have so far,

291
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,880
between them,

292
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,320
there is still some connection.

293
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,380
Plus, they live in the same building.

294
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,260
We can't even rule out that

295
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,890
from buying the tickets

296
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,160
to the April 5th Case,

297
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,490
they had contact outside of call logs.

298
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,250
Could it be that Ma Xiaoquan

299
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,050
went on the run after the crime?

300
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,320
To go camping?

301
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
The surveillance shows that

302
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,640
on the day of the April 5th Case,

303
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,120
Ma Xiaoquan left through the main gate

304
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,360
around 5 p.m.

305
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,760
Based on the surroundings of the crime scene

306
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,680
and the distance to Ma Xiaoquan's home,

307
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,610
we can infer that

308
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,360
he likely didn't know

309
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,020
that Liu Ping had been killed.

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,520
Brilliant, Captain Zheng.

311
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,080
Suck-up.

312
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Everyone's gone.

313
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,520
These two are so weird.

314
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,250
They live in the same building.

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Their tableware is the same.

316
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,520
They live upstairs and downstairs,

317
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
yet they talk on the phone every day.

318
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,200
I asked you to make some snacks for the booze,

319
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
and you can't even get that right.

320
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,160
I eat the worst food every day,

321
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
and drink the worst booze.

322
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
You can't even give me a child.

323
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,880
Ma Xiaoxi was often a victim of domestic violence.

324
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,920
The neighbors called the police.

325
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
But Ma Xiaoxi always withdrew the report.

326
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,720
This is Ma Xiaoxi's home.

327
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,690
Okay.

328
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,920
You wait here.

329
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,520
We'll go in first.

330
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:39,850
Okay.

331
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
It pisses me off just looking at you.

332
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,660
Even pigs eat better than I do.

333
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,100
What are you doing?

334
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,420
Who are you?

335
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,440
Who let you in?

336
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,840
Yang Shan,

337
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,450
when are you paying back the money you lost last time?

338
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,000
Are you with Lao Si?

339
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,280
Give me two more days.

340
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,680
I...

341
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,000
There's another game in two days.

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,520
I'll win and pay it all back together.

343
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,120
Sure.

344
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,840
Domestic violence, gambling.

345
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,970
You check every box.

346
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,650
What do you mean?

347
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,610
What do you think I mean?

348
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,640
It's a misunderstanding.

349
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,500
Let me explain.

350
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,440
We'll deal with your business later.

351
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,520
Whatever we ask you in a moment,

352
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,650
think carefully and answer honestly.

353
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Ma Xiaoxi, right?

354
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,450
Yes, I am.

355
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
We're from the Public Security Bureau.

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,880
We have a few questions.

357
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,360
Okay.

358
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,920
How many people are in your family?

359
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,180
Where are they all now?

360
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,370
It's just me and my husband.

361
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,170
Your husband abuses you like this,

362
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,010
does your family just stand by?

363
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,440
I don't have any family.

364
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,170
It's just me.

365
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,320
According to the household registration,

366
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,520
don't you have a younger brother?

367
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,680
He went out of town for work.

368
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,810
I can't count on him.

369
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,700
Out of town?

370
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,860
Where is he?

371
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,250
In...

372
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,240
In Huishan.

373
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,890
Huishan?

374
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
That's not right.

375
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,920
I remember he's been in Jianglin for the past two years.

376
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,480
A while ago,

377
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,610
didn't you two meet?

378
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,360
We haven't met.

379
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,800
This is your brother, right?

380
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,680
Isn't his name Ma Xiaoquan?

381
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,340
Why does the ID say Song Sijun?

382
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,010
I don't know.

383
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,200
I do.

384
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,960
Yang Shan.

385
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,720
Her brother has a record.

386
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
He's not a good person.

387
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,400
What did he do?

388
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,460
Her brother...

389
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,330
...once stole a boss's wallet.

390
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,370
He stole 10,000.

391
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,040
When?

392
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,480
Where?

393
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,480
That...

394
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,340
billiard hall.

395
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,640
That was years ago.

396
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,040
Got any money?

397
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,770
Give it to me.

398
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,800
This time,

399
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,240
I'll definitely win it back.

400
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,280
Where would we have money?

401
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,010
You drink and gamble every day.

402
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,880
Have you ever earned a cent for this family?

403
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,520
You think I don't make money?

404
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,920
Why did I marry you?

405
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,160
You can't bear children.

406
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,560
You can't make money.

407
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,800
Look at your long face every day.

408
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
You're just a jinx.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,560
It's all your fault I lose money.

410
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,290
Give it here.

411
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,740
What are you doing?

412
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,079
Stop it.

413
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,960
Give it back.

414
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,520
Damn!

415
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,839
Sis,

416
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,599
are you okay?

417
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Yang Shan.

418
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,520
If you touch my sister again,

419
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,680
I'll kill you.

420
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Get lost!

421
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,400
Do you hear me?

422
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,920
Get out.

423
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,970
Let's go.

424
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,880
You said your brother

425
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,520
hasn't been back for years, right?

426
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,600
It was just a theft case.

427
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
He's already been reformed.

428
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,540
Why won't he come back?

429
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,480
He's working out of town.

430
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,720
He doesn't have time to come back.

431
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,250
Working?

432
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,720
Does working require a fake ID?

433
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,680
He's in this province today,

434
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,720
and in that province tomorrow.

435
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
He runs around all the time.

436
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,360
Don't you find that strange?

437
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't know anything about a fake ID.

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,260
I...

439
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,000
I only know he's working out of town.

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
Working?

441
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,920
What kind of work is that?

442
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,980
He doesn't send a penny home all year.

443
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,960
Officer.

444
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,600
I knew it all along.

445
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,480
Her brother

446
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,400
is definitely suspicious.

447
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,000
Yang Shan,

448
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
he is still your brother.

449
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,800
My brother?

450
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,760
My surname is Yang, and his is Ma.

451
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,690
He hits me every time he comes back.

452
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,520
Officer.

453
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,040
I swear on my life,

454
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Ma Xiaoquan

455
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,800
is involved in something huge.

456
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,400
Xiaoquan.

457
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Xiaoquan.

458
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,010
What exactly happened?

459
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,880
Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

460
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Sis.

461
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,840
Stop asking.

462
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
From now on, just pretend you don't have a brother.

463
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,360
Did you do something bad again?

464
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,040
Listen to me.

465
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,120
Let's go to the police and explain everything.

466
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,560
You're still young.

467
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,520
You'll be fine.

468
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,680
I can't explain it.

469
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,200
If I tell them,

470
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
I'll never get out of prison.

471
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,260
Sis.

472
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,800
Don't ask questions or ask around.

473
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,240
Yang Guang already bought my ticket.

474
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I'm leaving soon.

475
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,360
By the way.

476
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,880
Once I leave, I'm not coming back.

477
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,560
Sis,

478
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,280
you have to take good care of yourself.

479
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,200
If anyone asks,

480
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,980
just tell them I went out of town for work.

481
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,880
Also,

482
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,620
don't ever contact me.

483
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,160
If I need anything,

484
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,800
I'll get in touch.

485
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,240
Sis.

486
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
Where are you going?

487
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,660
What year was this?

488
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,720
2007.

489
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,360
Who is this Yang Guang you just mentioned?

490
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,560
My sixth uncle's son.

491
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,600
Do you have any news about him?

492
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,480
Where does he live?

493
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,040
Haven't seen him in years.

494
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,000
My sixth uncle said

495
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,730
he's an executive in a big city.

496
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
Talent runs in the Yang family.

497
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,880
Look at your Ma family's

498
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,010
disgraceful trash.

499
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,680
Is that him?
