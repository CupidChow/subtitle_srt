1
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,760
You didn't know who left the note,

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,520
yet you followed instructions?

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,780
You just burned it because he told you to?

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,930
It's about my daughter.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,320
I'd do anything.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,520
Besides,

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,920
it wasn't anything bad.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,840
I've spent eleven years looking for the killer.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
I finally found him today.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,520
I couldn't be happier.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,400
So, after watching the video

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,440
and hearing the recording,

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,370
how did you feel?

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,760
They deserved it.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
It was doing society a favor.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,080
You didn't bring your phone.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,680
Did he tell you to do that too?

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,600
Yes.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,130
Have you ever thought about

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,170
who sent you to Qingyang Mountain?

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,360
I think it was

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,020
Cheng Kangren.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,480
Why?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,520
Because that car belongs to the company.

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,320
Besides me,

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,120
he drives it the most.

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,920
How else would he know where I went?

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,840
I went to Qingyang Mountain,

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,240
but I didn't tell anyone.

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,620
So what do you think

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,080
his motive was?

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
I just want to kill him.

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,250
I want him to die a miserable death.

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,440
Just because you suspect

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,840
he killed Li Xueqiong?

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,760
What's wrong?

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,520
Isn't that enough?

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,920
What makes you so sure he's the murderer?

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,000
He's the only one who wanted Xueqiong dead.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So you deliberately lured him

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,960
to the Qingyang Mountain Warehouse.

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,880
Tie him up,

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,000
then take him to the fireworks factory.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,600
Right?

45
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,200
Lure him.

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,800
I followed him there.

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,530
Why didn't you just do it at the warehouse?

48
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,560
I know the fireworks factory well.

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,479
The video on this phone,

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,340
what device did you use to film it?

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,240
What video?

52
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,800
Do I have to spell it out for you?

53
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
You went to great lengths to help Li Xueqiong take revenge.

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,440
Didn't you know?

55
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,639
Did she record it?

56
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,120
What do you mean?

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,180
What video is this?

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,890
You found the killer of Feng Youning long ago.

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
You didn't think

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,760
your plan was seamless, did you?

61
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,040
When Ma Xiaoquan died,

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,240
didn't you light fireworks by the tent?

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,920
Just like you did for Feng Tingye.

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,730
What are you talking about?

65
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,560
Do I need to be more specific?

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,320
When Ma Xiaoquan died,

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Li Xueqiong was standing right there watching.

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,600
Impossible.

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,560
Li Xueqiong didn't kill anyone.

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800
We checked.

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,280
Your deposits across various banks at the time

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,040
added up to about 100,000.

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
Where did the remaining 400,000 come from?

74
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,120
I borrowed it.

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,400
From whom?

76
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,180
Cheng Kangren?

77
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,000
How much did you borrow from him?

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
60,000.

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,160
Then the remaining 300,000 plus,

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,560
where did that come from?

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Think carefully.

82
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,640
We have time.

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,170
My wife borrowed the money.

84
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,160
I don't know who she borrowed it from.

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,360
Shouldn't you be chasing the murderer?

86
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,980
Why are you pestering me here?

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,200
I will say it again.

88
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,880
I didn't kill anyone.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,730
We understand your situation.

90
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
But I still don't believe

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,840
that you would kill Li Xueqiong.

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Because you have no motive or reason.

93
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,760
For so many years,

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
whether financially

95
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,920
or in daily life,

96
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,560
you've been the one helping her.

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,000
I love her so much.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
How could I possibly hurt her?

99
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,680
Your deep love for her,

100
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,300
I really admire it.

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,120
At the same time, for Li Xueqiong,

102
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,050
I feel relieved.

103
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,480
Because for so many years,

104
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
you were the one saving her,

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
keeping her company,

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
not Feng Tingye.

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,560
You insisted Feng Tingye was the killer from the start.

108
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,490
I want to ask you,

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,400
why do you think that?

110
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,760
He wanted to get rid of

111
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
Li Xueqiong.

112
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,340
Wouldn't a divorce be enough?

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,800
Why did he have to kill?

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Unless...

115
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,530
unless Feng Tingye and Li Xueqiong

116
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,360
killed someone together.

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,240
Impossible.

118
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,920
Li Xueqiong

119
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,560
never killed anyone.

120
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
Never.

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,840
Why are you so certain

122
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,800
that Li Xueqiong has never killed anyone?

123
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
For all these years,

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
I've known her.

125
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,820
She's had such a hard life.

126
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,640
I've always been by her side.

127
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,900
She couldn't have killed anyone.

128
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
She is a victim.

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,800
She is a victim.

130
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,159
She is a victim.

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
But she is also a suspect in our case.

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
We need evidence to verify your story,

133
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,580
to prove her innocence

134
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,260
and clear her name.

135
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
That's impossible.

136
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,640
She is innocent.

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,920
How could Xueqiong kill anyone?

138
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,250
She didn't kill anyone.

139
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,780
It was Feng Tingye who killed her.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
It must be him.

141
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,860
What about the motive?

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
The reason?

143
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,060
Where is the evidence?

144
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,840
Feng Tingye killed someone.

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,760
Li Xueqiong knows it.

146
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,680
Tell us about the night of June 1, 2007,

147
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,610
and Qian Xiangyun's car accident.

148
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,800
2007?

149
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,000
And...

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
A car accident?

151
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
Stop acting.

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
Why keep resisting?

153
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,890
I'm telling you,

154
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,370
Cheng Kangren has confessed everything.

155
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
What a scumbag.

156
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
He stabbed me in the back.

157
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,240
Okay.

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,040
Listen.

159
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,760
Xueqiong.

160
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
Xueqiong.

161
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,640
Xueqiong.

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,920
Xueqiong.

163
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,500
Qian Xiangyun.

164
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,360
Wake up.

165
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,840
Tingye.

166
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,440
My daughter.

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,500
The day they came to borrow money from me,

168
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,180
I didn't ask anything.

169
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
And they didn't say anything.

170
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,720
It wasn't until two years later

171
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,120
that I heard from others

172
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
that Xueqiong's daughter had died.

173
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,720
She had gone mad, too.

174
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,170
I quit the fireworks factory that day.

175
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,720
Feng Tingye happened to be starting a home textile business,

176
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
so I went to apply.

177
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
It wasn't until later,

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,530
when Xueqiong told me everything,

179
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,420
that I realized

180
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,120
Feng Tingye didn't dare to divorce.

181
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,170
He was afraid Xueqiong would expose everything.

182
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
Xueqiong suffered so much.

183
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,220
She never thought of leaving him.

184
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,840
She never thought of betraying him, even until death.

185
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,160
But Feng Tingye killed her.

186
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,600
I hate myself.

187
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,720
I hate myself

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,360
for not killing him sooner.

189
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,840
You loved her so much.

190
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,280
If she had asked

191
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,090
for your help with revenge,

192
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,900
would you have helped her?

193
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,240
Yes.

194
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,160
Would you have betrayed her?

195
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,840
Never.

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
I wouldn't have let Xueqiong

197
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,100
get any blood on her hands.

198
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,000
The accident likely occurred

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
on the night of June 1, 2007.

200
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
It's hard to determine the exact time.

201
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,840
Because

202
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,800
the road was remote,

203
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,040
and there were no surveillance cameras.

204
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,840
By the time we found it,

205
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,040
it was already June 3.

206
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,960
The car was completely burnt out.

207
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,720
According to the files,

208
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
it's speculated that Qian Xiangyun

209
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,760
drove the car down the slope herself.

210
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,920
The traces on the roadside

211
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,980
match this theory.

212
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
She likely swerved

213
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,920
to avoid an oncoming vehicle

214
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
or falling rocks,

215
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,240
and went off the cliff.

216
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,200
Her trunk

217
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,640
contained a lot of fireworks,

218
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,970
so the fire was intense.

219
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,840
We confirmed it wasn't post-mortem burning.

220
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,520
An autopsy was performed at the time.

221
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,120
When someone burns to death,

222
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,240
the body shows vital reactions.

223
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,120
So it wasn't post-mortem burning.

224
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,040
Did you find the victim's phone

225
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,520
or personal items at the scene?

226
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,800
Those were burned to ashes.

227
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
Technology back then wasn't like it is now.

228
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,480
Many substances

229
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,740
couldn't be detected.

230
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,360
After identifying the victim,

231
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,960
we checked her call records.

232
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
She was a bank manager,

233
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,090
so she was on the phone a lot.

234
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,560
But the call logs

235
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,290
didn't show anything unusual.

236
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
However, in the early hours,

237
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,280
she called her daughter.

238
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,330
That's probably when the accident happened.

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Sunday.

240
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,640
Mom said...

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
she'd take me hiking on Sunday.

242
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,320
She...

243
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,040
Why did she...

244
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,600
Why did she go by herself?

245
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,360
It's not Sunday yet.

246
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,530
How could...

247
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,560
How could there be an accident?

248
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,160
It shouldn't be.

249
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,400
It's not Sunday yet.

250
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,880
Miss,

251
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,960
Stop crying.

252
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
We suspect

253
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
your mother went to Qingyang Mountain to buy fireworks.

254
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,640
There are many firework manufacturers on Qingyang Mountain.

255
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,440
Fireworks?

256
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,320
Uncle Dai said he was going to buy fireworks.

257
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,780
Uncle Dai said he would go.

258
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,720
Why did my mom go buy fireworks herself?

259
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Where is Uncle Dai?

260
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,500
Why didn't Uncle Dai come?

261
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,960
It's not Sunday yet, is it?

262
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Why are you here?

263
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,040
To ask about the 6.1 Case.

264
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,880
Ask Xie Tong?

265
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
These two girls were quite close.

266
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,640
I want to ask Xie Tong,

267
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
to see if she knows

268
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,440
who else Feng Youning

269
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
had contact with.

270
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
Let's wait a bit.

271
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,720
Her mother just had an accident.

272
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,960
It's not appropriate to ask now.

273
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,840
We haven't seen hide nor hair of Feng Youning.

274
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,520
How can we wait?

275
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,600
Can we really wait?

276
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,040
If you ask her now,

277
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,440
she won't be able to give you a straight answer.

278
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,840
Her father arrives tomorrow.

279
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,370
Wait until he's here to ask.

280
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,120
Feng Youning?

281
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,650
What happened to Feng Youning?

282
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
How could she go missing?

283
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
She was kidnapped.

284
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,970
Her parents gave all the money to the kidnappers.

285
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,240
Is there still no news of her?

286
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
If they come to you for information,

287
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,780
just tell them whatever you know.

288
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,420
Don't pressure yourself.

289
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,000
Try to stay calm.

290
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,320
Your father knows what happened.

291
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
He's very worried about you.

292
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,400
He's already on his way back.

293
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,530
Don't worry.

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
It'll be okay.

295
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,920
You go in.

296
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,020
I won't talk to her.

297
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,200
Comfort her.

298
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,120
Auntie.

299
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,240
It wasn't an accident.

300
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,920
Why?

301
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
Why them?

302
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,080
Dai Yu,

303
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,600
tell me.

304
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,320
Tell me it isn't true.

305
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,760
I'm going to see Feng Tingye.

306
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,290
Xie Tong,

307
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,240
why is it Li Xueqiong?

308
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,440
Xie Tong,

309
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,280
I've treated Li Xueqiong for two years.

310
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,000
Why?

311
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Xie Tong.

312
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,080
Xie Tong.

313
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
Xie Tong.

314
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
Xie Tong.

315
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,320
The patient has stage 3 glioma.

316
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,450
She doesn't have much lucid time left.

317
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,800
The family should spend more time with her.

318
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,200
Don't leave any regrets.

319
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,000
Dai Yu,

320
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,500
how is Xie Tong?

321
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,240
She's still in the hospital.

322
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,370
She's been in a coma.

323
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,680
The doctor said

324
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,160
she might have stage 3 glioma.

325
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
I actually asked you here

326
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,400
to discuss this with you.

327
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,820
I want to stay with her at the hospital for a few days.

328
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
Her parents are gone.

329
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,640
I feel I should go take care of her.

330
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,440
I understand.

331
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,320
Go ahead.

332
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,200
By the way,

333
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,360
One more thing.

334
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,760
Inside Li Xueqiong's body,

335
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,640
the semen belonging to Feng Tingye

336
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,570
was likely planted deliberately.

337
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
There's a new discovery.

338
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,880
At first,

339
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,740
we thought the low sperm activity

340
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,080
was due to Feng Tingye's age.

341
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,560
But I carefully re-examined

342
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,920
the semen parameters.

343
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,280
I found that

344
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,160
its pH level is acidic,

345
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,970
and the protein degradation is significant.

346
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,180
These changes couldn't have happened within 12 hours.

347
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,599
It must be at least three days old.

348
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,839
You mean

349
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,859
someone collected Feng Tingye's semen in advance?

350
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,400
Yes.

351
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,560
You must tell us clearly,

352
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,650
who you have had sexual relations with recently.

353
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,440
I haven't been with anyone.

354
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,160
No.

355
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,520
Then your semen was found inside Li Xueqiong.

356
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,850
How do you explain that?

357
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,600
I don't know.

358
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,520
I've told you everything.

359
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,720
I didn't kill Li Xueqiong.

360
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm innocent.

361
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,000
It's the only way to clear your name.

362
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,160
Think carefully.

363
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,420
Who exactly did you sleep with recently?

364
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,000
I remember now.

365
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,840
That day,

366
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,450
I drank too much.

367
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Really?

368
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
A man.

369
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes.

370
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,960
That's why he wouldn't talk.

371
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,530
So framing Feng Tingye,

372
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,280
killing Li Xueqiong, Ma Xiaoquan, and Yang Guang...

373
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,360
It was all him.

374
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,130
What exactly is his motive?

375
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,640
The victims and their families,

376
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
he doesn't spare any of them.

377
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,800
Gao Zhuang and the others have gone to the bar to check the surveillance.

378
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,460
As long as we can find this man,

379
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,500
everything will be resolved.

380
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
But I feel like something is missing.

381
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
After all this questioning,

382
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,600
Feng Tingye has no need or reason to hide anything.

383
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,800
Then aside from him,

384
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,720
Cheng Kangren had no motive or time to commit the crime.

385
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,920
So who else

386
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,010
could have gained Li Xueqiong's trust

387
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,800
and gotten the key?
