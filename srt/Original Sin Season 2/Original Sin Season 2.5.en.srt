1
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,920
Why isn't he answering?

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,400
Xueqiong.

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Use your phone.

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,480
Li Xueqiong.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,930
He's not answering.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,730
He's not picking up.

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,520
It's been a day.

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,120
Ningning.

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,960
Do you think something happened to her?

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,920
Impossible.

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,840
We already gave him the money.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,240
Ningning will be fine.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,560
Let's call the police.

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,580
Captain Zheng.

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,440
Ma Xiaoxi called.

16
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,039
She has something to report.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,039
Gao Zhuang, Sun Quan.

18
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:38,840
Carry on.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,280
Chen Yishi.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,009
Come with me.

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,289
This 'Fu' character

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
was written the year Xiaoquan left.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
I put one up every year.

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,600
This year,

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,920
I've put up the very last one.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,960
As long as my brother is here,

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,289
this home is still here.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
Now that he's gone,

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,900
this family has fallen apart.

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Let me do it.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Here.

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,160
This is the blessing your brother left for you.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,120
Keep it safe.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,840
I lied.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,970
I saw him a while ago.

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,800
Xiaoquan,

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,320
please don't go.

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
Sister,

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,520
listen to me.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,520
If the police come,

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,400
give the money to them for me.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,260
What happened?

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
I always feel like

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,450
someone is watching me.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,360
This is the money Xiaoquan gave me back then.

47
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
It's all here.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,890
You can count it.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,490
200,000.

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
I didn't spend a cent.

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,570
My conscience wouldn't let me.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
I didn't dare spend it.

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,130
Did Ma Xiaoquan come back to see you often?

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Actually, these past few years,

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,080
I knew he was in Jianglin,

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,640
but we never met.

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
Every spring,

58
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,440
he sneaks back

59
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,720
and leaves a sapling in the yard.

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,280
I planted them all.

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm afraid to go too far from home.

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm afraid that one day he'll come back,

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
not find me,

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,640
and leave again.

65
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,040
But you knew he came back.

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
Why didn't you persuade him to turn himself in?

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
I tried.

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,329
But later, I didn't dare try again.

69
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,780
After all, he is the only relative

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,640
I have left in this world.

71
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
He is my brother.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,040
He's my own flesh and blood.

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,560
How could I bear to send him to prison?

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,800
Believe me.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,720
He isn't a bastard

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,040
who is rotten to the core.

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,960
The money he stole,

78
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,290
he didn't touch a penny.

79
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
He didn't want to do this.

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,329
But he had no choice.

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,730
But have you considered

82
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,200
that others lost their flesh and blood too?

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
It was a human life.

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,800
That girl was only twenty when she died.

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,040
You kept quiet to protect your brother.

86
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
But do you realize

87
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,920
that the law cannot be trampled on?

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,960
You can go to prison for harboring a criminal.

89
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880
Don't do that.

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,760
Please get up and talk.

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,370
If the family wants my life,

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,300
I'll accept it.

93
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,960
If they want me in prison,

94
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
I can accept that too.

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,610
But I have only one request.

96
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,019
Let me see Xiaoquan one last time.

97
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,000
I beg you.

98
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,360
Where is Ma Xiaoquan's room?

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
It's that one.

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,640
Why is the window open?

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,300
I remember closing it.

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,600
Let me.

103
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,520
Step aside.

104
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,380
Jinjin.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,800
The house...

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,330
Does Ma Xiaoquan have a key?

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,400
Yes.

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Size 37 shoe prints

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,000
lead from the window to the bedroom,

110
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,360
and stop only in front of the desk.

111
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,160
The other party's goal is clear.

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,660
Judging by the extent of the footprints,

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,860
Ma Xiaoquan must have come later.

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,240
His goal in coming

115
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,970
was likely to take what was inside the ink cartridge.

116
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,080
Dr. Dai.

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,840
Magnetic powder was detected on that bowl.

118
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,440
Quite a significant amount.

119
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,720
226 is outside.

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,200
The grease on Yang Guang's elbow matches the table.

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,330
But it's completely different from what was in the food.

122
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,100
Captain Zheng.

123
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,400
There are fingerprints left by Ma Xiaoquan on the ink box.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,120
There's also a set

125
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,240
of glove prints.

126
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
What about the order?

127
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,360
The glove prints are underneath,

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,160
and the fingerprints are on top.

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,160
Look here.

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
The size 37 shoe prints

131
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,960
led from the window

132
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
to the bedroom

133
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
and stopped only at the desk.

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,660
His goal was clear.

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,640
He was after the contents of the ink box.

136
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,840
Judging by how the footprints overlap,

137
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,500
Ma Xiaoquan must have come later.

138
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
If he came back to check

139
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,240
if his money was still there,

140
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,440
I could understand that.

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,840
But why check this thing?

142
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
Maybe inside this ink box,

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,760
there's something more important than money.

144
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Important enough

145
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,050
that someone else wants it too.

146
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,170
I'll go find Dr. Dai.

147
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,320
Even if the bottom of that bowl

148
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
really has iron powder,

149
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,720
can it be located with just this magnet?

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,480
Of course.

151
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,570
This isn't an ordinary magnet.

152
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,000
It's a neodymium magnet.

153
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,920
It's very powerful.

154
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,160
Now that we have the magnet

155
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,890
and the oil stains as evidence,

156
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,880
we can rule this as

157
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,920
homicide.

158
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,160
That's the current situation with these two cases.

159
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,720
Yang Guang

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,800
was murdered.

161
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,080
As for Ma Xiaoquan,

162
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
the investigation is ongoing.

163
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
Let's assume

164
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,810
Ma Xiaoquan was also murdered.

165
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,200
Then the suspect,

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,840
to plan these two meticulous murders,

167
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
must have needed a long time.

168
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Also,

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
he must know Yang Guang and Ma Xiaoquan

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,040
very well.

171
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,680
Someone who knows the fugitives inside out

172
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,560
someone who knows the fugitives inside out

173
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,120
and

174
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,960
is doing everything to kill them

175
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,360
is very likely

176
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
connected to that kidnapping case from years ago.

177
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,780
Could it be a revenge killing?

178
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,280
As far as we know,

179
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,440
the only ones with a grudge against both suspects

180
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
are the family of the June 1st Case victim,

181
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,240
Feng Youning.

182
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,360
That is, Feng Tingye

183
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
and his wife, Li Xueqiong.

184
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,600
According to our current information,

185
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,320
they've lived in Jianglin for a long time

186
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,920
and

187
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,300
run a chain of home textile stores there.

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,600
Ever since what happened to their daughter, Feng Youning,

189
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,730
for all these years,

190
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,000
they haven't had another child.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,530
Alright.

192
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,600
Investigate them indirectly first.

193
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
Make sure not to tip them off.

194
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Honey,

195
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,120
let's buy the apartment we saw last week.

196
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,480
The power is always out in this dump,

197
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,940
and I'm heavily pregnant.

198
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,600
Do you know who she is?

199
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,560
Do you know?

200
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,240
You...

201
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,810
What do you want?

202
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
Whose baby are you carrying?

203
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,980
None of your business.

204
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,440
You shouldn't be pregnant.

205
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,970
How many months?

206
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
How far along are you?

207
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,920
You shouldn't be pregnant.

208
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,760
Let go of me.

209
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,120
Let me go.

210
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,840
You shouldn't be pregnant.

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,560
Do you understand?

212
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,480
Help!

213
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,980
There are ten sets of this, right?

214
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,120
How many of the red ones?

215
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,560
Hello.

216
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,760
Excuse me.

217
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,220
Are you the store manager?

218
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,440
I am.

219
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,850
May I ask who you are?

220
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,360
We're from the Public Security Bureau.

221
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,220
We're here to ask some questions.

222
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,520
Let's talk over here.

223
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,900
You keep counting.

224
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Thank you.

225
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,610
May I have your name?

226
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,840
My surname is Cheng.

227
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,700
Cheng Kangren.

228
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,840
Business is good.

229
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Where is your boss?

230
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,050
The boss and his wife are both busy.

231
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,880
So,

232
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,010
I usually look after the store.

233
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,480
Here,

234
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,850
have some water.

235
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,450
How long have you been here?

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,320
It's been over two years.

237
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,000
Two years.

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,400
Yes.

239
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,800
You became the store manager in just two years.

240
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,160
You must have impressive skills.

241
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,080
Not at all.

242
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm from the same hometown as the boss and his wife.

243
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,440
We were also classmates,

244
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
so they look out for me.

245
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
Otherwise, given my situation,

246
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,520
where else could I find a good job?

247
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,000
Is it?

248
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,920
On April 5,

249
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
where were Feng Tingye and Li Xueqiong?

250
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,410
Do you remember?

251
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,080
April 5.

252
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,000
I should've been at the store on April 5.

253
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,600
As for where they were,

254
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,730
I really don't know.

255
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,280
What's wrong?

256
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Nothing.

257
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,520
Just asking.

258
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,740
Captain Zheng.

259
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,840
Wait a moment.

260
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,440
The card has appeared again.

261
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,040
The order was placed on March 18th,

262
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,770
but it only arrived yesterday.

263
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,760
The suspect knew full well

264
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,480
that Ma Xiaoquan wouldn't receive it,

265
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,810
yet still put it inside.

266
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,940
This shows that

267
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,120
this card wasn't meant for Ma Xiaoquan at all.

268
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,180
It was meant for us.

269
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,210
Hello, officer.

270
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,300
I'd like to ask,

271
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,640
is there something wrong with this shipment?

272
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Nothing is wrong,

273
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,340
Boss Cheng.

274
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,330
When did this shipment arrive?

275
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,040
It arrived yesterday.

276
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Who signed for it?

277
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,340
It's my shop's goods, so surely it was me.

278
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,600
So,

279
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,720
when you signed for it,

280
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,050
did you open it to check?

281
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,520
But this shipment was urgent,

282
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,040
so I haven't had time to check it yet.

283
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,900
Then from yesterday until today,

284
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,000
have Feng Tingye and Li Xueqiong come back?

285
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,640
No.

286
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,280
The boss is on a business trip,

287
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,410
so he didn't come by.

288
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,360
We need to take this quilt back

289
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
for examination.

290
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,920
Don't worry.

291
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,520
We'll return it if there are no issues.

292
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,840
Also,

293
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,170
I need to check the surveillance footage.

294
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,240
Sure,

295
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,120
no problem.

296
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,440
Alright,

297
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,640
we will fully cooperate.

298
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
The monitor is over here.

299
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll take you there.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,330
Okay.

301
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,050
Thank you for your trouble.

302
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,240
Who did you go on this business trip with?

303
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,720
Why do you smell

304
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,200
like women's perfume?

305
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,480
My assistant.

306
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,760
You know her.

307
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,640
What about the client?

308
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,720
Do you want me

309
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
to make money to support you,

310
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,080
or stay at home all day

311
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,040
doing nothing

312
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,730
and let you serve me?

313
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,080
I was just doing your laundry.

314
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,960
No.

315
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,680
Your wife

316
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
almost pushed me downstairs today.

317
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,130
What are you going to do?

318
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,400
But the one who fell

319
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,600
wasn't you.

320
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,120
Feng!

321
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
If you keep this up,

322
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll abort the baby tomorrow.

323
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
What are you saying?

324
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Come on. Sit down.

325
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,080
You...

326
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,050
need to focus on prenatal care.

327
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,240
Stop arguing.

328
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,740
I am revising the divorce agreement.

329
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,120
Honey,

330
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,200
remember,

331
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,060
you have to leave more for our son.

332
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,280
In this matter,

333
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,610
I can't be too ruthless.

334
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
In these past years,

335
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,130
she hasn't had an easy life.

336
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,520
I don't want her,

337
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,980
after the divorce,

338
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,640
to have to worry about money.

339
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,480
Hasn't Mr. Feng come back from his trip yet?

340
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,520
Stop calling.

341
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,680
Tingye has been busy lately.

342
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,650
I'll stay here with her.

343
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,360
You being here...

344
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,420
taking care of his wife? What is this?

345
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,100
Is he really that busy?

346
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,940
As long as she gets better,

347
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,920
it doesn't matter who helps.

348
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,650
For all these years,

349
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,660
haven't I lived like this?

350
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
But she needs her husband's care,

351
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,800
not a friend's.

352
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,700
A friend's love is still love.

353
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,840
I'll do whatever I can

354
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
to make her feel better.

355
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,660
Then why did you let her know about Guan Miao?

356
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,080
That's our private business.

357
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
What's it to you?

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,520
Do you want to drive her crazy again?

359
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,200
I don't.

360
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,250
I want her happiness more than anyone.

361
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
But Feng Tingye can't give her that.

362
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,800
And you can?

363
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,600
I can.

364
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,730
Does she need it?

365
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,680
To me, she's not just my patient.

366
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,640
She's also my friend.

367
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,400
She's suffered enough.

368
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
I don't want her hurt

369
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
by love again.

370
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,240
And your presence

371
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,119
will only push Feng Tingye

372
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,380
further away from her.

373
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,079
Observe your mind.

374
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,170
Purify your nature.

375
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
Attain perfect liberation.

376
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,520
You're usually so busy.

377
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,120
Why ask me out all of a sudden?

378
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,600
Actually...

379
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Asking someone out for coffee in the middle of the night.

380
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,860
You're really something.

381
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Sorry about that.

382
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,770
For us police officers,

383
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,480
especially forensic doctors like me...

384
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,760
Well...

385
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,200
Go ahead.

386
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,080
What's up?

387
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,280
Dr. Dai.

388
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,600
Actually,

389
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
I asked you here to ask some

390
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,810
psychological questions.

391
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,970
Say, if there are two people...

392
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
who neither...

393
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
get close...

394
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,480
nor stay too far apart...

395
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,400
and keep this up for 11 years,

396
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,640
what is their mindset?

397
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,920
Are you asking me

398
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,520
from the perspective of criminal psychology?

399
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,850
Since when are you so reserved with me?

400
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,480
Am I?

401
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,280
First,

402
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,240
psychological support.

403
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,800
Knowing they are close

404
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,240
can help both sides

405
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,520
relieve fear

406
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,480
and loneliness.

407
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,560
Secondly,

408
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,760
close physical proximity

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,160
allows both parties

410
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,960
to subconsciously feel that

411
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,480
when in need,

412
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,320
they can quickly receive

413
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,600
help and care from each other.

414
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,480
However,

415
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
overly intimate contact

416
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,880
can also cause both parties

417
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
increased psychological pressure.

418
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,380
Therefore,

419
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,320
an appropriate distance

420
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
allows both parties

421
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,880
to a certain extent,

422
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,250
to maintain a normal state of mind.

423
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
After all, people

424
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,940
always want to achieve psychological balance.

425
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes.

426
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,440
Thank you.
