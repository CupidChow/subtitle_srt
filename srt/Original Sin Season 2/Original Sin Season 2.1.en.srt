1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,860
Captain Zheng.

2
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,160
The powder Pang Beiyuan left by the window isn't ashes.

3
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,820
It's flour.

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,680
Go look again.

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
We owe Dai Yu an explanation.

6
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,540
Mr. Dai's ashes

7
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,020
can't just go missing.

8
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,770
Let's head back.

9
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,970
Let's go.

10
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,120
Improve public welfare, share development results.

11
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,160
Dr. Dai,

12
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,140
the pathology results are in.

13
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
In Pang Beiyuan's body...

14
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,200
We found a drug that hasn't been seen on the market.

15
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,540
He isn't an addict.

16
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,720
I think

17
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,820
he might be testing drugs.

18
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,960
Then,

19
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,420
do we keep investigating?

20
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Let's hand it over to the task force.

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Let's transfer it along with the Pang Beiyuan case.

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,450
Let the past remain in the past.

23
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,290
You two should get some rest

24
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,100
and go for a psych evaluation.

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,120
I think

26
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,000
Chief Fu asked us to do this psych evaluation

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,930
just so we could rest for a few days.

28
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,820
Why do a psych evaluation?

29
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,340
I'd rather go home and sleep for two days.

30
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,820
Come on.

31
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,480
We're already here.

32
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,280
Let's just dutifully get checked

33
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,540
to put his mind at ease.

34
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,880
You go ahead.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,380
I'm going to take a nap.

36
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,560
So young.

37
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,840
Xie Tong.

38
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,880
This is a magic trick about time.

39
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
A plastic bag.

40
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,490
Do you believe I can conjure the time you drew?

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,400
I don't.

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,280
If I can do it,

43
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,840
I'll grant you a wish.

44
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,040
The magic is about to happen.

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,810
I'm amazing, right?

46
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,370
Go ahead.

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960
I'll grant you any wish.

48
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,400
My wish is

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,730
that you never show me magic tricks again.

50
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
I thought you weren't going.

51
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,050
Do you remember the time magic?

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,610
Plastic bag.

53
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360
It's getting cold.

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,160
My mom knitted these gloves for you.

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,640
Aren't you afraid of the cold?

56
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,900
Remember to wear them.

57
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,040
Thank you.

58
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,730
Can't you really stay at my house forever?

59
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
My parents are divorced.

60
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,250
I have to go home with my dad.

61
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,380
Your dad is so busy,

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,120
how could he have time to take care of you?

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,720
By the way,

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,340
give me your home address.

65
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,210
Plastic bag.

66
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,220
Remember to come back and find me.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,530
How long have I been asleep?

68
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,130
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Did I say anything?

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,000
You said

71
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,280
you wanted to see me do another magic trick.

72
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,280
Congratulations,

73
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,010
Officer Dai.

74
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,540
Everything is normal.

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,480
Do you have any other questions?

76
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,570
Have you been

77
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,800
in Jianglin all these years?

78
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,650
Why didn't you come find me?

79
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,480
Excuse me,

80
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,720
Dai Yu.

81
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I'll pick up the report another day.

82
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,220
The cornea is completely cloudy.

83
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Livor mortis is mainly on the lower limbs.

84
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,320
It doesn't fade when pressed.

85
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,650
Rigor mortis has spread to the whole body.

86
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Time of death

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,380
was at least six hours ago.

88
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
It's 10:50 now.

89
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,560
The crime occurred before 4:50 a.m. on April 5.

90
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,400
Gao.

91
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,810
Here.

92
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,690
Focus on all suspicious persons from April 5.

93
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,960
Sun Quan.

94
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Evidence bag.

95
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,400
By the way,

96
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,840
did you find the victim's phone at the scene?

97
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
We didn't find it.

98
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,880
All right.

99
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,530
Carry on.

100
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,760
Dai Yu,

101
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,300
did you find anything?

102
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,400
The blood loss here

103
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,530
is estimated to be 1,000 milliliters.

104
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,600
We can confirm

105
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
that this is the primary crime scene.

106
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,040
This tenant

107
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
is on a short-term lease.

108
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,920
It's only been two months and he's caused this mess.

109
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
How are we supposed to rent the place out now?

110
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,680
Alright.

111
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,520
Get to the point.

112
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,450
Do you have his registration info?

113
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,360
Yes.

114
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
I register everyone according to regulations.

115
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
Make a copy for me.

116
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,080
Okay.

117
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,440
And what about the surveillance coverage

118
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,700
in your neighborhood?

119
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
This is an old neighborhood.

120
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Surveillance coverage is mediocre.

121
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,080
Even if there are cameras,

122
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
the landlords installed them themselves.

123
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
That's against regulations.

124
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,450
Get it fixed.

125
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,080
Okay.

126
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,770
Let's go.

127
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,940
Jin Jin.

128
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,210
Sit down, everyone.

129
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,940
Let's talk about the case.

130
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,140
The victim is Liu Ping.

131
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,320
32 years old.

132
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
1.83 meters tall.

133
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,800
On his left chest,

134
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,600
there is a removed snake tattoo.

135
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
There are no defensive wounds.

136
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,100
The fatal wound is on the neck.

137
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
But so far,

138
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,560
we haven't found the murder weapon.

139
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,200
The wound below the clavicle

140
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
is 11 millimeters long.

141
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,680
The length of the wound on the neck.

142
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,610
10 millimeters.

143
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,880
The distance between the two wounds should be 12.5 centimeters.

144
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,140
He only has these two external injuries.

145
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,080
The bleeding point is this one on the neck.

146
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,960
Judging by the shape of the wounds,

147
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,480
they were likely caused by the same object.

148
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,720
The victim's fingerprints were deliberately destroyed.

149
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,360
And

150
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,180
he was using a fake ID card.

151
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
The damage to the fingerprints

152
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,080
doesn't look like it was caused by work.

153
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
It looks deliberate,

154
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
and happened many years ago.

155
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
It's possible he was hiding his identity.

156
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,920
Indeed.

157
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,450
This man is strange.

158
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,600
His neighbor said he rarely interacted with anyone.

159
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,400
He wore a hat and a mask whenever he went out.

160
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,000
I guess

161
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
he was deliberately hiding himself.

162
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,360
No signs of struggle or defensive wounds on his arms or legs.

163
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,040
His teeth were intact.

164
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,600
No foreign objects in his mouth.

165
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,840
There were oil stains on the elbows.

166
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,520
Go take a sample and analyze it later.

167
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,960
Okay.

168
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,360
Since April 3rd,

169
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,320
the victim hadn't left the house.

170
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,520
On the night of the 3rd,

171
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,680
a neighbor saw the victim buying a lot of food and supplies.

172
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,960
The neighbor thought he was hosting friends.

173
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,420
But from the 3rd to the 5th,

174
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,320
no one visited the victim's home.

175
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,360
We checked everyone who entered or left this building on the 5th.

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,820
Apart from the residents,

177
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,240
only three people visited the building

178
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,320
before Liu Ping's case.

179
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,640
Two were delivery guys,

180
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
and one went to the wrong building.

181
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,680
Our investigation has

182
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,280
ruled out these three as suspects.

183
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,340
The sample results

184
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,440
will be brought over shortly by the new forensic doctor, Chu Mitang.

185
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,770
With such a small wound,

186
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
could the weapon be

187
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,380
something like a nail?

188
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,000
It doesn't look like it.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
If the weapon were a nail,

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
the wound wouldn't be this shallow.

191
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
Also, it would be rounder,

192
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,520
not flat and long like this.

193
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,000
But there doesn't seem to be any other sharp object

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,640
at the scene that matches this shape.

195
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,560
Later, use an environmental scanning electron microscope

196
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,320
to check if it was caused by a sharp metal object.

197
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Given the victim's condition after the injury,

198
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,040
if the suspect wanted to continue harming him,

199
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,000
he would have had no ability to resist.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
Prepare for the autopsy.

201
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,360
Let's see what internal changes there are.

202
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,090
Sun Quan,

203
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,840
tell us about the crime scene.

204
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,000
I've already drawn the blood spatter map

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,040
of the scene.

206
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,700
Take a look.

207
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,680
Good work.

208
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,440
The correct movement trajectory of the bloodstains

209
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
should be from the dining table

210
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,000
to the window,

211
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,250
then to the wall,

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,850
and finally to the door.

213
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Although the body was found by the door,

214
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,040
based on the blood distribution,

215
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,320
the initial location of the injury

216
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,600
should be near the dining table.

217
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,440
The bloodstains and bloody handprints at the scene

218
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,480
all belong to the victim.

219
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,840
The phone is missing too.

220
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,400
Maybe,

221
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,000
the suspect disposed of it.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,200
At the deceased's home,

223
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,360
I found a jacket from Huanglong Auto Repair Shop.

224
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
It's very likely he works there.

225
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
Huanglong Auto Repair Shop.

226
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,960
I know that place well.

227
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,160
Basically everyone working there is an ex-convict.

228
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,000
The owner is named Huanglong.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
He's also an ex-convict.

230
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,280
There was food on the floor at the crime scene.

231
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
If it started near the dining table,

232
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,880
then the suspect and the victim

233
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,360
most likely had a conflict

234
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
while they were eating.

235
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
Two people sitting down to eat together...

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,280
I suspect it was an acquaintance.

237
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,000
Assuming it was an acquaintance,

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
the suspect should be

239
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,880
very familiar with the location.

240
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,410
After patrolling with Chen Yishi and Jin Jin,

241
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
we found that this neighborhood

242
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
has very few surveillance cameras,

243
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
but the roads extend in all directions.

244
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,240
It makes it very easy to hide.

245
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,400
I think these factors

246
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,960
would make it easy for the suspect to flee.

247
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,720
Let's check the surveillance again carefully.

248
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,050
Expand the search range

249
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,240
and see if any suspicious people appear.

250
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,880
Chen Yishi,

251
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,520
come with me to Huanglong Auto Repair Shop tomorrow.

252
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,920
Okay.

253
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,980
Captain Zheng,

254
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
the forensic results are in.

255
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,560
Apart from the victim,

256
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,200
we found no biological traces

257
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,860
of a second person in the room.

258
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,120
Zheng... Captain Zheng.

259
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
An acquaintance.

260
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,220
I arrested him before.

261
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,160
Where is your boss, Huang Long?

262
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,690
The boss is busy in the back.

263
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,010
Carry on with your work.

264
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,200
Huang Long.

265
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,000
Here.

266
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,660
Officer Zheng,

267
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,040
business is pretty good lately.

268
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,370
It's not bad.

269
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,540
Officer Zheng,

270
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,160
what brings you

271
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,880
here so suddenly today?

272
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,280
Straighten your back.

273
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,720
Yes.

274
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Don't be nervous.

275
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,120
We just want to ask you something.

276
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,640
Okay.

277
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,090
Does Liu Ping work here?

278
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,650
Yes, he does.

279
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,600
But,

280
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
he's already resigned.

281
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,480
He quit.

282
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,130
Yeah.

283
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,200
When was this?

284
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,730
Around the beginning of the month.

285
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,400
I think it was

286
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,040
April 3.

287
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,020
Why did he quit?

288
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,360
He said he wanted to go back to his hometown.

289
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,620
Where is his hometown?

290
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,480
Exactly where,

291
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm not sure.

292
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,840
But judging by his accent,

293
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,960
he seems to be from the south.

294
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,520
Has he ever been in trouble before?

295
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,180
Do you know?

296
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,090
I don't know.

297
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,450
He never talks about it.

298
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,970
But I bet it was serious.

299
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,200
Anyway, he doesn't seem like

300
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
someone fresh out of prison.

301
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,160
You know,

302
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,200
my place is full of

303
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,560
shady characters.

304
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,680
But every one of them

305
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,640
is a little afraid of him.

306
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,370
This is done.

307
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,770
Liu Ping,

308
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,040
have you fixed that engine yet?

309
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,370
The customer has been rushing us for days.

310
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,340
I'm asking you a question!

311
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,610
It's been done for ages.

312
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,400
What is his main role

313
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,530
here at the factory?

314
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,770
Aside from work,

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,960
do you know anything

316
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,760
about his habits?

317
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,160
He mainly fixes engines.

318
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,460
When he's not busy,

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,330
he just sits over there.

320
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,200
A few times,

321
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,530
I thought he was asleep.

322
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,080
But when I walked up to him,

323
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,960
he was staring wide-eyed. Scared the hell out of me.

324
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,200
Or he just smokes there.

325
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,520
Anyway, all day long,

326
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,320
I have no idea what's on his mind.

327
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,480
You know what?

328
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,640
It's actually pretty comfortable here.

329
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,680
Sleeping here isn't bad at all.

330
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,740
He's not sleeping.

331
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,760
He just zones out and smokes every day.

332
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,160
You're quite observant.

333
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,640
What did you go in for?

334
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,360
Theft.

335
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,120
So, based on your observations,

336
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,850
why does he sit here zoning out?

337
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,840
He...

338
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
just wants to run.

339
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,930
This is Liu Ping's toolbox.

340
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,660
None of us have touched it.

341
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,000
Well?

342
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,560
Any leads on the tickets?

343
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,640
The victim didn't just buy tickets to Jiangyuan.

344
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,280
He also bought tickets for four other places.

345
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,119
And they were all purchased on the same day.

346
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,839
Two tickets for each destination.

347
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,880
The other set was for a man named Song Sijun.

348
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,079
This Song Sijun,

349
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,480
where is he now?

350
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,839
We can't find any ID info on Song Sijun.

351
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,960
We only found him through the train tickets.

352
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,839
In 2016, he came to Jianglin

353
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,240
with the victim, Liu Ping.

354
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,359
That means

355
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,640
the two of them agreed to come to Jianglin together

356
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
and left together.

357
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,360
But they didn't specify

358
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,320
exactly where they were going.

359
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,450
Faking identities,

360
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,010
destroying fingerprints,

361
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,080
and buying so many tickets

362
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,120
for the same day.

363
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,580
These two are highly suspicious.

364
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,410
How is it?

365
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,080
The shape of his wounds

366
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,160
is really strange.

367
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,840
I really can't figure out

368
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,600
what kind of sharp weapon

369
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,320
could cause such a result

370
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,160
and lead to his death.

371
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,300
Assuming it was a bow-shaped weapon,

372
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,000
the depth of the wound

373
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,530
shouldn't be this shallow.

374
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,480
Forget it.

375
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,480
Stop thinking about it.

376
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,740
Let's go back to the scene and take a look.

377
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,680
No weapon was found at the scene,

378
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,520
which suggests the suspect

379
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
likely took it with them.

380
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,090
Also, the blood trail at the scene is continuous.

381
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
How did the suspect,

382
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,970
without disturbing the scene,

383
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,160
eliminate their own traces?

384
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,240
That implies

385
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,000
the suspect

386
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
didn't bring any traces in to begin with.

387
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,920
Before they entered,

388
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,360
they were already prepared.

389
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,420
Like wearing shoe covers and gloves.

390
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
For the victim to

391
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,880
bring someone dressed like that

392
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,010
to the dining table,

393
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,280
it must mean

394
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,200
it was someone

395
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
he knew very well.

396
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,280
Right.

397
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,720
In the victim's body,

398
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,560
I found a high concentration of alcohol.

399
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
That means

400
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,600
he was drunk at the time.

401
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
Being drunk,

402
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,960
that explains

403
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,760
why there were no signs of a struggle.

404
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
The victim, Liu Ping,

405
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,680
had lost the ability to resist.

406
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
Not necessarily.

407
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,640
Look.

408
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,280
The continuous blood trail consists of drip stains.

409
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,720
This could only be caused by the victim moving on his own.

410
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,800
That shows

411
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,400
even though he was drunk,

412
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,840
he hadn't completely lost his mobility.

413
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
This just proves

414
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,480
the suspect was extremely fast.

415
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,040
Fast enough that the drunken victim

416
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,640
had no time to react.

417
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,880
At the time of the crime,

418
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,940
the killer took out a U-shaped weapon

419
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,240
and stabbed Liu Ping.
