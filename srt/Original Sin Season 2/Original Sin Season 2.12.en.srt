1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,600
That's right.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,680
He is my husband.

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,360
Rongrong.

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,320
And who are these two?

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,120
We are from the Criminal Investigation Detachment.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,160
We are here today

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
to speak with Liu Rong

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,840
and verify some information

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,100
regarding Yin Haohan.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,920
Rongrong.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,520
Don't be sad.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,760
Isn't the past all behind us?

14
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,720
Now,

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
don't you still have me by your side?

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,050
Actually, I've had this ring ready

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,360
for a long time.

18
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,300
But I never had the courage to take it out.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,800
I guess

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,120
I was just waiting for the right moment.

21
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,640
Of course,

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,640
don't worry.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,979
I'm not forcing you to marry me right now.

24
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,440
I just want to tell you...

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
I just want to let you know how I feel.

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,130
I will take responsibility

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,920
for your life from now on.

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,170
No matter what happens,

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
I'll stay by your side

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
and keep you safe.

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,170
Did you hear what I said?

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,040
Rongrong.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,160
Are you okay?

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,360
Honey.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,220
This is for you.

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
Why did you get me this?

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
It must have been expensive.

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,780
Expensive?

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,960
My wife

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,020
deserves the best.

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,700
Why don't we return it?

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,200
Return it?

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,040
Then I'll return my clothes, too.

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,640
No, don't.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,440
I'll keep it then.

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,720
Honey.

47
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,210
Happy 2nd anniversary.

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,600
I hope that every day from now on,

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,530
you'll be even happier than today.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,640
I will be.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,560
Miss,

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,020
these flowers are for you.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,480
Thank you.

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,370
Why did you decide to send flowers?

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,970
I didn't order any flowers.

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,250
It's been two years.

57
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I've waited two whole years for him.

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,480
The same restaurant.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,960
The same seat.

60
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,240
Why did you choose this moment

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
to tell me he's dead?

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,920
Why?

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,600
I thought I was over it.

64
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,240
I had almost forgotten him.

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
We can't bring him back.

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,250
Don't be too sad.

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,020
Take care of yourself.

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,400
How did he die?

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
We're still looking into it.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,530
However, what is certain is

71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,620
that Yin Haohan was killed

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,480
in July 2016.

73
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,440
(Killed)

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,520
He was such a kind person.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,120
Who would kill him?

76
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,160
So,

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,800
Liu Rong,

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,200
we'd like you to think carefully.

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
Have you and Yin Haohan

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,410
encountered anyone before

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,040
whom you had conflicts with

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,560
or

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,260
held grudges against?

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,519
No.

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,920
He never argued with anyone.

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,660
Then do you know anyone

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
who works in a cold storage facility

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,080
or

89
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
a frozen food processing plant?

90
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,200
No.

91
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,600
Did Yin Haohan ever

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,580
mention the cold storage on Wenjing Road to you?

93
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,760
No, never.

94
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,370
Liu Rong.

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,980
It's getting late.

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,440
Go back and get some rest.

97
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,600
Try to calm down.

98
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,159
Don't worry the people who care about you.

99
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,720
Leave this to us.

100
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,600
We'll need you back at the station in a few days

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,530
to assist with the investigation.

102
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,159
I...

103
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
Can I see Haohan again?

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,850
Let's begin.

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,520
Son.

106
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Save me.

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,400
Save me.

108
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,840
Dai Yu.

109
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,580
I don't want to die.

110
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
These hands of yours,

111
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,700
who have they actually saved?

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,800
Well?

113
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,840
Have you determined the cause of death?

114
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,920
The body has frostbite

115
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,250
and signs of poisoning.

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,920
But

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,840
they happened at the same time,

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,240
so I can't determine the cause of death.

119
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,040
I'll check the pathology slides.

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,600
The signs of poisoning

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,240
were caused by carbon dioxide.

122
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,160
But carbon dioxide

123
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
isn't a toxic gas.

124
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,440
The cold storage is huge.

125
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,280
The ventilation system,

126
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,410
we checked that too.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,460
It can't be gas poisoning.

128
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,960
It seems the cold storage

129
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,690
isn't the primary crime scene.

130
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
We got word from the police station.

131
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,780
Yin Haohan worked here two years ago.

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,760
But we don't know the specifics.

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,640
Let's go inside and find out.

134
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,620
The environment here is nice.

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,960
You must have saved a lot recently, Captain Zheng.

136
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,020
Why not buy a place?

137
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,000
That's enough, you two.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,930
Focus on the job.

139
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,960
Hello.

140
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,800
You must be Captain Zheng.

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,280
Hello.

142
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,360
We're from the Criminal Investigation Detachment.

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,120
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,450
Sure.

145
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm the person in charge here.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
How long have you worked here?

147
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
Three years.

148
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,400
Do you know your employees well?

149
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,120
Of course.

150
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,200
I'm the HR manager.

151
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,600
According to our information,

152
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,320
Yin Haohan worked here two years ago.

153
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,400
Do you remember him?

154
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

155
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,200
He was the manager of our Engineering Management Department.

156
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,720
Could you show us his resume,

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,380
the project files he managed,

158
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,360
and his clock-in records?

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,480
Sure.

160
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,840
Please have a seat.

161
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,560
Just a moment.

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,360
Thank you.

163
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,800
Could you check

164
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
his attendance records

165
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,880
for July 7, 2016?

166
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,960
Sure.

167
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,760
Here it is.

168
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,840
This is his attendance record for that day.

169
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
He clocked in as usual that morning,

170
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,480
but in the afternoon,

171
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,640
he left an hour early.

172
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,370
He said he was meeting a client.

173
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,040
Do you know which client he was meeting?

174
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm not sure.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,280
After he went missing,

176
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,600
the police came to ask questions.

177
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,320
All the clients he dealt with

178
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,450
were investigated,

179
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
but no one saw him that day.

180
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,040
Yin Haohan has been missing for two years.

181
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,400
Didn't you suspect anything?

182
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,720
We thought at the time

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,320
he might have been poached by another company.

184
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,200
Or maybe

185
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,920
he had something else going on.

186
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
I wasn't that close to him.

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
We were just colleagues.

188
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,220
Can we take these client records?

189
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,930
I'll make a copy for you.

190
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Thank you.

191
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,520
Rongrong.

192
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760
Building materials.

193
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,200
I hope

194
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,220
you can understand me.

195
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,600
This is all so sudden.

196
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,100
Please give me some more time.

197
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,890
All I can think about is Haohan.

198
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,280
I want to know how he died.

199
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,640
Rongrong.

200
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,360
I understand.

201
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Isn't that Liu Rong?

202
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,820
Who is that guy?

203
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,900
Liu Rong's suitor.

204
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,440
When Captain Zheng and I went to find Liu Rong that day,

205
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,240
we happened to see him proposing to her.

206
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,600
Let's go.

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
Let's go check it out.

208
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,820
But I am your fiancé now, aren't I?

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Whatever the problem is,

210
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,840
it's my duty to share the burden with you

211
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,040
and face it together.

212
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,120
Seeing you suffer alone like this,

213
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,400
I...

214
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,560
really feel terrible.

215
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Enough, Jiancai.

216
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
Stop talking.

217
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,220
I just want to be alone for a while.

218
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,730
Liu Rong.

219
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,260
Officer Zheng,

220
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,440
we meet again.

221
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,520
Officer Zheng,

222
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,450
long time no see.

223
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,850
What brings you here today?

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,320
We're here to ask about

225
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,840
Yin Haohan's previous work situation.

226
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,900
Regarding Mr. Yin,

227
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,300
we're counting on you.

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,260
For the past two years,

229
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,520
Rongrong has been thinking about him.

230
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,800
Mr. Yin is such a good person.

231
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,930
With what happened,

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,260
we all feel very sorry.

233
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,640
This is our duty.

234
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,980
It's what we should do.

235
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,960
When did you and Yin Haohan

236
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,920
first meet?

237
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
We met a few times,

238
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,240
but we weren't very close.

239
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,320
What do you do?

240
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,040
I work in construction materials.

241
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
Do you have a business card?

242
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,920
May I have one?

243
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,880
Yes.

244
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,520
Here.

245
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,120
Thank you.

246
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,680
When did you and Liu Rong

247
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,600
first meet?

248
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,580
We met two years ago

249
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,400
by chance.

250
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,080
Wake up.

251
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,980
Wake up.

252
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,320
Are you okay?

253
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,970
Liu Rong.

254
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Yin Haohan's things,

255
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
do you still have them?

256
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:42,960
Yes.

257
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
Everything is here.

258
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Is it convenient for us to take a look at your home?

259
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,060
No problem.

260
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,880
All of Haohan's belongings at the company,

261
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,410
I've brought them all back.

262
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,290
Actually, at that time,

263
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,240
I wasn't trying to commit suicide.

264
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
I had been searching for someone back then.

265
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,330
I don't know what happened,

266
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,490
but I walked to the middle of the road and fainted.

267
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,220
I was probably just too tired.

268
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Inside this wallet...

269
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,200
All these business cards

270
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
are his clients.

271
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,600
Sorry.

272
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,250
I dropped the card you gave him.

273
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,680
I didn't give him this.

274
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,840
This is probably the card

275
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,500
from the flowers someone sent me before.

276
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,200
Why did he keep it?

277
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
You mentioned before

278
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,260
that on your anniversary,

279
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
someone suddenly sent you flowers.

280
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,600
That's right.

281
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,820
But I don't know who sent them.

282
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,640
Flowers like this,

283
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,770
and cards like this,

284
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,720
I've received them many times.

285
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,450
Could it be from Cheng Jiancai?

286
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,160
It was after Haohan went missing

287
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,640
that I met Cheng Jiancai.

288
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,520
After Yin Haohan disappeared,

289
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
did you receive similar flowers

290
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,980
or greeting cards?

291
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,360
No.

292
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,760
Our wedding anniversary two years ago

293
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,000
was the last time I received flowers.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,660
After you married Yin Haohan,

295
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,330
besides Cheng Jiancai,

296
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,200
did you have any other suitors?

297
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,480
I was already married.

298
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,530
Who would pursue me?

299
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,240
I have some pathology slides.

300
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,920
I'm not sure if my analysis is accurate,

301
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,480
so I wanted your opinion.

302
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,120
I've read the reports you sent.

303
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,920
I think your analysis is spot on.

304
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,720
The first layer of ice crystals

305
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
was formed by friction between the body and the ice.

306
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,680
The second layer

307
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,600
was formed when the body was frozen.

308
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,560
Does that mean

309
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,560
the victim was in two low-temperature environments?

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
Then the primary crime scene

311
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
must be similar to a cold storage,

312
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,960
and very close by.

313
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,440
Otherwise, when the body was moved,

314
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
it would have thawed,

315
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,570
and the ice crystals wouldn't remain.

316
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,530
Your logic is sound.

317
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,840
Your analysis is correct.

318
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,120
You've made great progress.

319
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,250
Not bad, Chu Mitang.

320
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,320
As expected of Dr. Dai's apprentice.

321
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,080
A great teacher

322
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,440
produces a brilliant student.

323
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,640
Eagerly awaiting,

324
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,800
coming for you.

325
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,280
Such romantic words

326
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,340
are obviously an expression of love.

327
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360
Why did he suddenly stop sending them?

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
Could it be that after getting Liu Rong's response,

329
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
he stopped sending them?

330
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,330
Impossible.

331
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,240
Liu Rong and Yin Haohan seem to have a deep bond.

332
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,200
If she wanted to hide an affair,

333
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,080
she wouldn't have told us

334
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,480
about the flowers.

335
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
I think there are other possibilities.

336
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,660
Think about it.

337
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,520
Yin Haohan

338
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,720
secretly kept so many anonymous cards.

339
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,360
That shows he really minded this.

340
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,960
Someone kept showing affection to Liu Rong.

341
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
Even on their wedding anniversary,

342
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,250
they chose to send flowers.

343
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,500
That's a bit provocative.

344
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,560
As a man,

345
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,520
wouldn't he be curious about who it was?

346
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,600
Even when he found out who it was,

347
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
he would choose to confront them.

348
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,520
So this person sending flowers

349
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,720
is currently the only one likely

350
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,650
to have a conflict with Yin Haohan.

351
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,170
Let's go inside and take a look.

352
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,840
I wrote this card by hand.

353
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,520
Because I wrote it so many times,

354
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,780
I remember it clearly.

355
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,280
But the exact time,

356
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I can't remember clearly.

357
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,320
Before August 2016.

358
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Identical cards,

359
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
you must have written them many times.

360
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
The flowers were the same, too.

361
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,580
Pink roses.

362
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,040
On July 6 of the same year,

363
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
you delivered flowers to Bailu Restaurant.

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,280
2016.

365
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,140
Bailu Restaurant.

366
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,440
I'll have to check the order records.

367
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
Not sure if I still have them.

368
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,120
Yin Haohan.

369
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,740
He bought flowers on July 7th.

370
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,040
This guy,

371
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,170
do you remember him?

372
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,240
Him?

373
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,600
He came here before to question me,

374
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,320
asking who ordered flowers for his wife.

375
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,440
He insisted on getting the sender's contact info.

376
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040
He even topped up 5,000 yuan.

377
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,240
So I agreed to give him the sender's info.

378
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,700
Ever since he got the card,

379
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
he hasn't used it once.

380
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,960
Do you still have that person's contact info?

381
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,820
It's long gone.

382
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,960
It was written in this notebook,

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but he tore it out.

384
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,360
Thank you.

385
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,460
Seriously.

386
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:08,980
Thanks.

387
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,040
Thank you.

388
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Is this a city gate?

389
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,400
People keep coming in waves.

390
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,440
The place we visited today is very close to your home,

391
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,640
so I thought I'd stop by and mooch a meal.

392
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,060
It is on the way.

393
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
So, how is the investigation going?

394
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,530
We found out that

395
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,240
there was a man who often sent flowers to Yin Haohan's wife.

396
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,800
On the day Yin Haohan disappeared,

397
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,560
he went to the flower shop,

398
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,760
got the contact info,

399
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,400
and immediately

400
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,600
went to find this man.

401
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,020
A love rival, then.

402
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,120
But

403
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,250
where did they meet?

404
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,720
We don't know that.

405
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,320
Anyway,

406
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
that day, Yin Haohan

407
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
got off work an hour early.

408
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,240
He said he was meeting a client,

409
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,040
but actually, he went to confront that man.

410
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,840
How do you know

411
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,760
that they definitely

412
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,320
met?

413
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,320
That man,

414
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,320
ever since Yin Haohan disappeared,

415
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
has never sent flowers to Liu Rong again.

416
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,640
Regardless of whether he had anything to do with Yin Haohan's death,

417
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,880
at least on July 7, 2016,

418
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,900
he definitely met Yin Haohan.

419
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,320
Once we find this man,

420
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,800
we can further narrow down where Yin Haohan was last seen.

421
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,240
The primary crime scene is similar to a cold storage room,

422
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
but it's more airtight,

423
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,520
and not suitable for hiding bodies.

424
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,720
You can investigate along those lines.

425
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,120
Okay.

426
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,880
Leave finding the place to me.

427
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,480
By the way,

428
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,440
if Yin Haohan's disappearance

429
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,760
is related to his meeting with the suspect,

430
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,090
then the meeting place,

431
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
the primary crime scene,

432
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,440
and the cold storage

433
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,840
shouldn't be too far apart.

434
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,700
Also, the suspect must have a car.

435
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,560
You're the best, Dr. Dai.

436
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,360
Coming here,

437
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,640
I not only filled my stomach,

438
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,800
but also cleared up the case.

439
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,840
Alright, stop being cheeky.

440
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Eat your noodles.

441
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,920
By the way.

442
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,480
Dai Yu,

443
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,860
how was your break?

444
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You guys came in waves.

445
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
How could I not rest well?

446
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,040
All right.

447
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,730
Since you're rested, get back to work.

448
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,820
Listen,

449
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,680
Yin Haohan's family

450
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,920
will come to the bureau in a couple of days.

451
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,780
We're planning

452
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,800
a second autopsy for Yin Haohan.

453
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,800
Okay.

454
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,599
Your husband's ring.

455
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,330
Have some water.

456
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,690
Officer,

457
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,200
you must find Haohan's killer.

458
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,240
Over the past two years, due to Haohan's disappearance,

459
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
my mother-in-law's health has collapsed.

460
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,840
I must know

461
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,040
who hurt him,

462
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,400
and who destroyed our family.

463
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,200
Rest assured,

464
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,020
we will give you an answer.

465
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,520
But at the same time,

466
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,400
we hope you can understand.

467
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,330
We want to perform a second autopsy

468
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,720
on Yin Haohan.

469
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,040
Another autopsy?

470
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,120
I don't want my son cut open again.

471
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,720
Let it end here.

472
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,840
Ma'am,

473
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,300
this is crucial for finding the suspect.

474
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,320
I really hope you can understand.

475
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,450
I don't understand.

476
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,560
Finding the killer is your job.

477
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,280
I just want my son to come home whole.

478
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,300
I won't let you do another autopsy on him.

479
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,290
I won't allow it.

480
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,760
Please try to understand her feelings.

481
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,880
He was her only son.

482
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,980
We understand.

483
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,840
For you,

484
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,440
this is indeed too cruel.

485
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,700
Other than an autopsy,

486
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,960
please think of another way.

487
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,840
I must know the truth.
