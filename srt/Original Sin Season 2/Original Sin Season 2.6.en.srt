1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,600
You can't just touch

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,930
a girl's face like that.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,600
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,040
The people I usually touch

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,800
can't speak,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,040
so no one tells me.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
Drink your coffee.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,490
Why are you watching me do my brows?

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,970
I'm not thirsty.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,400
Looking at your brows quenches my thirst.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,130
You know, "quenching thirst by gazing at brows".

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,400
Alright, Plastic Bag.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,040
It's getting late.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
I can't stay and chat.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
I have work tomorrow.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm off.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
I'll walk you out.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,560
No need.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,560
If you have any questions,

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,090
feel free to ask me anytime.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,240
Okay.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,700
Don't forget the bill.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,280
Sir.

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,440
Here is your friend's eyebrow pencil,

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,360
and the bill.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,970
Mr. Feng,

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,440
we need information on your shop staff,

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,700
as well as records for the factory and delivery personnel.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,960
Since last month,

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,200
I've been on a business trip.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,660
I only got back yesterday.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,160
There are some things

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,650
I'm not too clear about.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,600
For that,

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,880
you need to ask

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,600
Cheng Kangren,

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,200
Mr. Cheng.

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,120
He's in charge of this store.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,960
On April 5,

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,720
your wife, Li Xueqiong,

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,650
where did she go?

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,560
Lately,

43
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,520
her mental state hasn't been good.

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,180
She usually

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
stays at home.

46
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,370
There's one more thing.

47
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,280
Go ahead.

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,080
This is from 2007,

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
when your daughter Feng Youning was kidnapped.

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,039
It's the ransom you paid.

51
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,370
Did you find the killer?

52
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,120
We're still looking.

53
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,840
If Xueqiong knew,

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,360
she would be very relieved.

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,320
We can finally give our daughter

56
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,600
justice.

57
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,840
By the way,

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,380
This money,

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
how did you find it?

60
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,120
The bills were numbered.

61
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,440
We traced the serial numbers

62
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,640
and found some clues.

63
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,480
As for the specific details,

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,560
we can't reveal them to you.

65
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,240
Once the case is completely closed,

66
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,170
this money will be returned to you.

67
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
The money isn't the problem.

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,650
It really isn't.

69
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,579
We'll be going now.

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,720
Take care.

71
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,920
By the way.

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,360
The two cards from the table and the sheets,

73
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,880
did you

74
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,000
detect any

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,880
fingerprints or other residue?

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
No fingerprints were found.

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,320
But we're not sure about other substances yet.

78
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,480
But I'm looking into it.

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,760
The results should be out tomorrow.

80
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,840
In this shop,

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,300
apart from Cheng Kangren,

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
no one else has touched the goods.

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,160
No one else has touched the goods.

84
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Do you think

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,960
the cards have any meaning?

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,800
A King of Clubs.

87
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,860
A Five of Diamonds.

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,560
Captain Zheng,

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,960
I've brought the report.

90
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,040
Quick, tell me.

91
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,880
At Ma Xiaoquan's house,

92
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,480
in the size 37 footprint,

93
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,120
traces of diesel were found.

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
The diesel in the small fire pit at the scene

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,160
is a match.

96
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,520
This confirms our theory

97
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,450
that the suspect started the fire.

98
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,680
Playing cards were found in both cases.

99
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,640
And they were meant for us to see.

100
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,240
Since it's hard to trace the arsonist,

101
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,300
Then let's check who placed the card.

102
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,720
This is the sheet that was wrapped around Ma Xiaoquan's body.

103
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,079
This is the one we got from Haomenglai Home Textiles,

104
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,740
the sheet with the poker card.

105
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,480
The texture of these two sheets is very similar.

106
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,280
They should be the same product.

107
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,970
Let's measure their specs.

108
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,890
Weight divided by area.

109
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,720
17.87 momme.

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,160
Excluding wear and tear,

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,840
it should have been around

112
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,700
19 momme when it left the factory.

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,040
This new one is actually 25 momme.

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
How can there be such a big discrepancy?

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,680
I checked Haomenglai Home Textiles' order records.

116
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,160
What Cheng Kangren ordered from the factory

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
was 19-momme sheets.

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,120
That means

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,180
this isn't a discrepancy.

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,360
Someone switched them.

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
So that poker card

122
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,520
wasn't put in later.

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,320
Someone prepared it in advance.

124
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Right.

125
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,720
Here's the plan.

126
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,680
Go find Zheng Ming.

127
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,960
Have him check the source.

128
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480
Find out where this 25-momme sheet

129
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,610
actually came from.

130
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,240
And

131
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,520
when it was switched.

132
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,120
Okay.

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm on it.

134
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,680
That's right.

135
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,080
This is our product.

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,440
Do you have the buyer's info?

137
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,840
We have this in stock.

138
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,360
It's all displayed over there.

139
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,290
No need to order.

140
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,520
In the last month,

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,760
who bought this sheet?

142
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,560
Do you remember?

143
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,440
Who would remember that?

144
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,040
So many people are getting married lately.

145
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,840
Our shop has sold

146
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,440
over a dozen sets this month.

147
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,920
Can we check the surveillance footage?

148
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,780
Surveillance?

149
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,730
We don't have cameras here.

150
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,560
After I pack each item,

151
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,040
And then delivered it myself.

152
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,440
If there were any issues,

153
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,920
I would have taken it out right then.

154
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Tell us about your route

155
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,580
from the factory to the store.

156
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
I usually take this road.

157
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,560
Did you stop anywhere during the delivery that day?

158
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,440
There's a public restroom on Huixing Street.

159
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,480
I finished a cigarette

160
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,740
and used the restroom.

161
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,960
Did you lock the car door?

162
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,210
I don't think so.

163
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,960
Captain Zheng,

164
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
how is the investigation going?

165
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,720
The suspect bought the bedsheet

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
from Zaomeng Home Textiles,

167
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,760
but left no information.

168
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,250
There's no surveillance footage either.

169
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
If there's no chance of a switch

170
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,980
at the factory or the store...

171
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,500
Then the suspect must have swapped it

172
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,920
while the delivery man was in the restroom.

173
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
You're so scatterbrained.

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,890
Don't forget next time.

175
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,280
Thanks for going out of your way to drop me off.

176
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,880
Let me

177
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,480
treat you to a meal.

178
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,000
Sure.

179
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,360
But let's do it next time.

180
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
I don't have time.

181
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,760
Xie Tong.

182
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,640
This patient,

183
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
can you tell me about her?

184
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,840
She...

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,690
After her daughter was killed in 2007,

186
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,280
she became mentally unstable.

187
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
Poor woman.

188
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,530
Ever since the incident with my daughter,

189
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,920
she's lost her mind.

190
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,720
Recently,

191
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,760
I don't know what triggered her,

192
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
but she insists she saw the suspect.

193
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,130
She just keeps drawing.

194
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,460
At the drop of a hat,

195
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,409
she runs to the police station,

196
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,050
saying she wants to report a crime.

197
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Dr. Xie,

198
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
please help her.

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
No rush.

200
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,160
Take your time.

201
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,130
What's with this portrait?

202
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,960
It's an interesting story.

203
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
Since the first time I met her,

204
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,159
she kept telling me

205
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,290
that she had seen the person who kidnapped her daughter.

206
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
So ever since then,

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
she's been drawing that person.

208
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Until last October,

209
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
when she said she finally finished the drawing.

210
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,720
Dr. Xie.

211
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
Thank you.

212
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Everyone else...

213
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,800
only you believed me.

214
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,400
I...

215
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,800
I finally drew him.

216
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,800
Thank you.

217
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
Do you want me to call the police?

218
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,720
Let's go.

219
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
There's no need for that.

220
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,799
Maybe she really did see him.

221
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,880
After all, she drew someone.

222
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,200
If it's not too much trouble,

223
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
could you use this sketch

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,600
to help her find him?

225
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,280
If the real killer is caught,

226
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,210
it will also help

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,690
with her condition.

228
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
How is she now?

229
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,680
Actually, since I took over,

230
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,640
she hasn't shown

231
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,600
any signs of madness.

232
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
Her family was just worried,

233
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
so they asked me to continue treating her.

234
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,320
So, what she has

235
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,760
isn't a mental illness?

236
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,680
It's more of a psychological issue.

237
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,440
Depression,

238
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,600
anxiety.

239
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
You could say that

240
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,280
her way of expressing emotion is a bit extreme.

241
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
I think

242
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,120
her husband cheating

243
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,520
has a lot to do with it.

244
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,130
A couple of days ago,

245
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
because of this,

246
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
she landed herself in the hospital.

247
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,130
A couple of days ago?

248
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,720
Is it serious?

249
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,960
Her friend Cheng Kangren has been taking care of her these past few days.

250
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,720
I'll ask about it when I get a chance.

251
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,760
Alright. Thanks.

252
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,160
Dr. Xie.

253
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,540
Xueqiong's condition

254
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
isn't very good.

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll check on her again when she wakes up.

256
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,780
If she doesn't get better,

257
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,210
I'll give you a call.

258
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,760
Thank you.

259
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,560
Officers.

260
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,400
I've prepared these for you,

261
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,260
the customer records since 2016.

262
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,400
Just check product code H2508.

263
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,800
Has the product code always been this number?

264
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,160
Yes.

265
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,580
It always has been.

266
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,360
Do you have any styles starting with the letter K?

267
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,280
The letter K?

268
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,020
We've never used that.

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
What's wrong?

270
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,160
It's nothing.

271
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Let me take a look.

272
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,600
I saw you on the phone.

273
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,520
How is Li Xueqiong?

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,860
Is she feeling better?

275
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Xueqiong isn't doing very well.

276
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,720
I came back to pack some things.

277
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,090
Are you going back to the hospital?

278
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,860
Let me help.

279
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,680
It's okay.

280
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,480
Sorry to trouble you.

281
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,410
Check if the batteries are inside.

282
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
They are.

283
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,540
It still makes a sound.

284
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,520
Are you taking this, too?

285
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,640
Yes.

286
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,520
It's for Xueqiong.

287
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,050
Whenever she hears this sound,

288
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,880
she feels much more at ease.

289
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,560
Xueqiong.

290
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Xueqiong.

291
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,760
Xueqiong.

292
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
Where are you?

293
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,360
Xueqiong.

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,520
It's too late.

295
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,160
It's too late.

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,800
Police!

297
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
My daughter has been kidnapped.

298
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,400
I left the money at Tianwaitian.

299
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,330
I'm begging you.

300
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,960
Please save her.

301
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,280
Please save her.

302
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,340
What are you doing?

303
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,400
Are you crazy?

304
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,880
Let's go, son.

305
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,680
Don't go.

306
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Xueqiong.

307
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,160
Xueqiong.

308
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,680
Xueqiong.

309
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm sorry.

310
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm late.

311
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
The police are here.

312
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
Police!

313
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
The police are finally here.

314
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,120
Hello?

315
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,280
No.

316
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,280
We agreed, not a penny less.

317
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
I'll come get it in a couple of days.

318
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,960
Don't try anything funny.

319
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Not a single penny less.

320
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,600
Who are you?

321
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,480
It's you!

322
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,600
It's you!

323
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,040
What are you doing?

324
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,720
It's you!

325
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,840
It's okay.

326
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,720
It's okay.

327
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm sorry.

328
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,920
She... She...

329
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,000
has some issues here.

330
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,480
It's okay.

331
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm sorry.

332
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,480
She has issues here.

333
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,360
Keep an eye on her!

334
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
I will.

335
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,520
I'm sorry.

336
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm sorry.

337
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,280
Xueqiong.

338
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,080
He's just a passerby.

339
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,460
He is the murderer.

340
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
Calm down, will you?

341
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,360
Okay.

342
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,760
I know.

343
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,680
How about this.

344
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,600
I'll pay the bill first.

345
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,040
Then,

346
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,200
I'll help you chase him.

347
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,000
Wait for me.

348
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,780
Wait for me.

349
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,360
Here.

350
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,460
Check, please.

351
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,160
How much is it?

352
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,820
Does he look like Ma Xiaoquan?

353
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,960
I think they're the same person.

354
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,920
Ma Xiaoquan has a small head and big ears.

355
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,960
In this portrait,

356
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,520
she also emphasized this point.

357
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,320
And according to Cheng Kangren's recollection,

358
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,360
Li Xueqiong likely recognized Ma Xiaoquan.

359
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,840
So she also has a strong

360
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,760
motive for the crime,

361
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,960
staging two accidents.

362
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Given Li Xueqiong's mental state,

363
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,960
is she capable of pulling this off?

364
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,360
But she did indeed draw Ma Xiaoquan.

365
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
From 2016 to 2018,

366
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,530
that's two whole years.

367
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
If she were sane,

368
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,120
she could have planned all this.

369
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,180
Captain Zheng.

370
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,280
There's a problem with Ma Xiaoquan's fetish group.

371
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Someone added Ma Xiaoquan through the group chat.

372
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
They asked him to record a show

373
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
on April 5.

374
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,660
They even set a time limit.

375
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,480
A three-hour limit.

376
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
The key is,

377
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,080
the person who made him record it

378
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,940
is Li Xueqiong.

379
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:51,720
Let's go.

380
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,050
Let's find Li Xueqiong.

381
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Ms. Li.

382
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,820
Officer Zheng.

383
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
What's going on?

384
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,860
Boss Cheng,

385
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,760
perfect timing.

386
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,480
We've been knocking for ages with no response.

387
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,680
She's not answering her phone either.

388
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,010
Do you know where she is?

389
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,820
She's probably still asleep.

390
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,920
Here are the keys.

391
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,720
Okay.

392
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,560
Is it this one?

393
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,360
Thank you.

394
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,760
Come in.

395
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,360
Xueqiong is a clean freak.

396
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
Everyone, change your shoes first.

397
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,650
We brought some.

398
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,320
Xueqiong.

399
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,920
Xueqiong.

400
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,160
I'm coming in.

401
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
Xueqiong.

402
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,040
There's damage to the fingernails.

403
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,400
It looks like during the hanging,

404
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,260
marks were left from struggling.

405
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,840
Livor mortis is mainly concentrated in the lower limbs.

406
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,770
There are petechial hemorrhages.

407
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,920
The distance from the bed to the heels.

408
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,080
51.4 centimeters.

409
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,860
Captain Zheng.

410
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,240
She must have been planning to host someone yesterday.

411
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,000
Otherwise, she wouldn't have bought so many groceries.

412
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,400
Also,

413
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,040
I found this in her pocket.

414
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,170
A shopping receipt.

415
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,700
I know you're upset right now,

416
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,700
but we still need to ask some routine questions.

417
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,960
Mr. Cheng.

418
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,240
Okay.

419
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,560
Besides you and Li Xueqiong,

420
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,680
who else has a key to the house?

421
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Feng Tingye.

422
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,290
When was the last time you saw Li Xueqiong?

423
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,880
Yesterday.

424
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,680
I picked Xueqiong up from the hospital.

425
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,640
Seeing she was fine,

426
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,200
I left.

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Where did you go?

428
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
I went back to the shop

429
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,370
to organize some goods.

430
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
Officer.

431
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,100
It must have been Feng Tingye.

432
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
You have to arrest him.

433
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,800
We...

434
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,240
The police will investigate that.

435
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,600
The police will investigate that.

436
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,480
Please calm down,

437
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,080
Mr. Cheng.

438
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,970
My condolences.

439
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,360
How did it go?

440
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,080
If she stood on the bed to hang herself,

441
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,800
there would definitely be footprints on the edge.

442
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,859
But I just checked,

443
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,900
and there are no such marks at all.

444
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,680
Also,

445
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,200
I just measured the distance

446
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,880
from the deceased's

447
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,599
feet to the ground,

448
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,280
as well as the width between the body and the bed.

449
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,140
Captain Zheng.

450
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,660
Something isn't right

451
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,480
about this scene.

452
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,040
Jin Jin,

453
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,800
have you contacted Feng Tingye?

454
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
I can't reach him.

455
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,599
Is her husband often away from home?

456
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,000
There isn't even a single short hair at the head of the bed.

457
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,599
He probably doesn't come back often.

458
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,880
I just checked the bathroom.

459
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,840
His toothbrush

460
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
shows no signs of use,

461
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,200
and the shaver

462
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,040
is out of battery.

463
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,320
Yishi,

464
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,980
look at this tread.

465
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,360
Captain Zheng.

466
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,220
Captain Zheng.

467
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,570
Look at these shoes.

468
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,480
There are horizontal lines in the middle.

469
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,880
In Ma Xiaoquan's hometown,

470
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,840
the traces left at the scene

471
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,640
also have horizontal lines.

472
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,970
And they're all size 37.

473
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,680
Take it back for comparison.

474
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,080
The ligature mark is shallow and broad.

475
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,360
There's very slight epidermal peeling.

476
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,820
It's a soft ligature mark.

477
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,960
Then it must be from the scarf.

478
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,200
The knot is open at the top,

479
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,040
deepest at the front of the neck,

480
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
consistent with hanging.

481
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,800
There's congestion at the base of the tongue.

482
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,040
The greater horn of the hyoid bone is fractured.

483
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
The left side

484
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,200
is worse than the right.

485
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,360
With the hyoid bone fracture,

486
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,840
the point of constriction is quite high,

487
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,040
roughly at the thyroid cartilage,

488
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,600
which matches the scene.

489
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,640
Strange.

490
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
There is damage to the fingernails,

491
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,880
but none on the feet.

492
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,760
If her nails are damaged,

493
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,960
it means that while hanging,

494
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,040
she instinctively grabbed the rope,

495
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
causing this kind of eversion injury.

496
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,560
And that cashmere scarf.

497
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,360
Logically,

498
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,200
her nails should have cashmere fibers embedded in them.

499
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,000
But look at Li Xueqiong's nails.

500
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,080
Aren't they too clean?
