1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,440
Yes.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,250
That's the guy in the photo.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,170
Come with me.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,450
Officer.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,360
Let me tell you,

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,840
that guy is bad news.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,040
Ma Xiaoxi.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
For what we're about to tell you,

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,260
you need to prepare yourself.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,170
Your brother, Ma Xiaoquan,

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,170
has been killed.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,960
My brother...

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,320
We're still investigating the cause of death.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,800
The person I just showed you

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,060
was the only one your brother contacted.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,560
If you have any leads,

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,440
please tell us.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,980
Yang...

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,360
Yang Guang.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,120
Where is he?

21
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,720
Regarding the case details,

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,200
we can't disclose them to you yet.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,330
Did he leave with Yang Guang back then?

25
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,970
Why did he leave?

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,160
I don't know.

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,160
You never suspected anything?

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,360
Why leave when everything was fine?

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,880
I said I don't know.

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,080
Jin Jin,

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,760
calm down.

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,600
We're not trying to pressure you.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,260
We know that

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,600
Ma Xiaoquan was your only family left.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,730
We've asked around.

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,200
Your brother was very protective of you.

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,400
If it weren't for him,

38
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,360
who knows how Yang Shan would have bullied you.

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
He was such a good kid.

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,620
Can you bear to let him die in vain?

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,680
His death

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,640
must be related to Yang Guang.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,729
I really don't know anything else.

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,039
Go.

45
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,039
Go.

46
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,479
Ma Xiaoxi.

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,120
Go.

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,039
Go.

49
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,560
Ma Xiaoxi.

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,080
Just go!

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,000
Go!

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,080
Go!

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Go!

54
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,620
Captain Zheng,

55
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,170
where is Chen Yishi?

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
Chen Yishi helped the local police

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
take Yang Shan to the station.

58
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,880
Captain Zheng.

59
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
The identities of the two victims

60
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,040
have been reconfirmed.

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520
Yang Guang and Ma Xiaoquan

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
are from the same village.

63
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,040
According to Ma Xiaoxi,

64
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,320
they both left Sheqi Village in 2007.

65
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,900
And judging by Ma Xiaoxi's reaction,

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,570
Ma Xiaoquan is definitely hiding something.

67
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,480
Gao,

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,600
what did you find?

69
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,329
We looked into Yang Guang's father, Yang Dayong.

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
Because for villagers to work in the city,

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
they have to go through him.

72
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,440
So Yang Guang

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,200
throws his weight around in the village.

74
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,520
As for that Yang Shan,

75
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,160
relying on his family ties with Yang Dayong,

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,020
he bullied Ma Xiaoxi constantly.

77
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,120
We also asked around.

78
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,160
Yang Dayong isn't home right now.

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,840
He's away on business

80
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,240
and will be back in a couple of days.

81
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,720
But we took down his contact info.

82
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,040
Gao.

83
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,770
Sun Quan.

84
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Yan Jin, canvas the village again.

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
Dig up information on Yang Dayong.

86
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,860
Find out more details.

87
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,960
We'll go to Yang Dayong's house.

88
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,090
Yes, Captain Zheng.

89
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,240
This is Yang Dayong's house.

90
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,360
And who is this?

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
This is Yang Guang's brother, Yang Hao.

92
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,840
He's not quite right in the head.

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Okay.

94
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,640
Thank you.

95
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,400
You can head back.

96
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,530
I'll leave you to it.

97
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,560
Hello.

98
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,880
Please,

99
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,320
have a seat.

100
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,360
Who are you looking for?

101
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
Thank you.

102
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,620
How old are you?

103
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
28.

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Do you live here alone?

105
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,200
My mom,

106
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,079
and my dad.

107
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
With my brother,

108
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,240
and this.

109
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,250
Who are you looking for?

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,480
Mom,

111
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,240
my brother's friends are here

112
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,160
to see him.

113
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Hello.

114
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,360
We're from the Criminal Investigation Detachment.

115
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,720
Hao.

116
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,570
Come inside and eat.

117
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
The food is ready.

118
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,440
Officer.

119
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,040
My son is out of town.

120
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,530
Is something wrong?

121
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,240
Is this your son, Yang Guang?

122
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,520
It looks a bit like him,

123
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,040
but not exactly.

124
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
This photo isn't clear.

125
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,040
Your son has a good job, right?

126
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,770
Has he contacted you recently?

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He's an executive.

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,530
Do you need a favor from him?

129
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,840
Where does he work?

130
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,920
A big company.

131
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,580
He doesn't even get holidays.

132
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,399
Auntie.

133
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,079
Actually, your son

134
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,040
isn't an executive.

135
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,970
He worked at our local repair shop.

136
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,520
He didn't contact you

137
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,010
because he passed away.

138
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,720
What?

139
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Gone just like that?

140
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
He was murdered.

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,440
Trash.

142
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,400
Get up.

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,920
What?

144
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,920
What is it now?

145
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,600
Where did you get the money for the tattoo?

146
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,520
None of your business.

147
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,720
None of my business?

148
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
I sent you to school,

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
and you dropped out.

150
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
How many times have you dropped out now?

151
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
I've only been gone for six months,

152
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,980
and you quit again.

153
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,640
So I quit. So what?

154
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,480
You quit.

155
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,040
Quit, quit, quit.

156
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Just like that.

157
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,980
If the teachers didn't know me

158
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,600
and show me some respect,

159
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
do you think you'd still be in school?

160
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,560
Who the hell do you think you are?

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
Look at your bangs.

162
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,640
Longer than a girl's.

163
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,880
And that snake tattoo.

164
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Are you trying to prove you're a man?

165
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,720
You spend all day

166
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,360
messing with that hair.

167
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
You don't look like a human.

168
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
You look like a freak.

169
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
What exactly do you want?

170
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,040
Nothing.

171
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,560
Are you going to school or not?

172
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
I can't.

173
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,530
You're rebelling now, huh?

174
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,720
You want to rebel?

175
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,120
Don't you dare stare at me.

176
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,920
Keep staring!

177
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
Go on, stare!

178
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,640
Why are you hitting the child?

179
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,970
You spoiled him rotten.

180
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,650
That Ma Xiaoquan you hang out with,

181
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,090
he got sentenced last week.

182
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,720
That hair of yours,

183
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,800
and that tattoo.

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,240
Where did you get the money?

185
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
Don't think I don't know.

186
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
Aren't you ashamed?

187
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,920
Have you no shame?

188
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,480
Spending stolen money.

189
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,700
If you'd robbed it yourself, I'd at least be impressed.

190
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,440
You've completely humiliated me.

191
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,200
The results from the samples you brought back are in.

192
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
The deceased, Liu Ping,

193
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,640
is actually Yang Dayong's son, Yang Guang.

194
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,320
I also looked into that theft case.

195
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,600
In 2005, Ma Xiaoquan

196
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,640
stole 10,000 yuan from a Tianwaitian locker.

197
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,800
He was sentenced to over a year.

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,960
He was released in 2007.

199
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,800
2007.

200
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,600
He was out a long time ago.

201
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
Why was he still running?

202
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,960
They must have done something else.

203
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,480
And that Yang Guang.

204
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,000
And that Yang Guang,

205
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
used to hang out with him all the time.

206
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,760
Ma Xiaoquan returned over two thousand.

207
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Yang Guang probably got a cut of the rest.

208
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,120
If you calculate based on that,

209
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,400
running for eleven years,

210
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,640
it must be something big.

211
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,040
After Ma Xiaoquan got out,

212
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
he must have partnered with Yang Guang

213
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,440
to commit another crime.

214
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,170
The info Ma Xiaoxi provided was somewhat useful.

215
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,730
But Yang Guang's mother

216
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,920
didn't provide anything useful.

217
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,800
I think the most important thing is,

218
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,560
both families think the other is responsible for the deaths.

219
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,220
Chen Yishi.

220
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
Hurry up.

221
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,520
I had Sun Quan

222
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,200
pull up records from 2007 to now,

223
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,330
covering all the cold homicide cases.

224
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,440
Everyone, bear with me.

225
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,840
We need to work overtime.

226
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,490
Focus on murders for money,

227
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,020
especially cases in this city from 2007.

228
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Why don't we go grab a bite first?

229
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
We'll continue investigating when we get back.

230
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,040
Bring Dr. Dai.

231
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,120
You guys go ahead.

232
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm not going.

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,330
My wife brought me food.

234
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
Then I won't go either.

235
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,650
I'll mooch some of his food.

236
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,720
I already ate.

237
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,200
I'll help review the files.

238
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Thanks for your hard work.

239
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,659
No problem.

240
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,440
Thanks for your hard work, Gao.

241
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,360
We're leaving now.

242
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,840
No problem.

243
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,520
Bye.

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,130
What's on your mind?

245
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
The place where Ma Xiaoquan stole things back then

246
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,560
was Tianwaitian Billiards Hall.

247
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Coincidentally,

248
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,930
I used to play pool there often in college.

249
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,320
Wasn't Tianwaitian right around here?

250
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Tianwaitian closed down years ago.

251
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,280
Dai Yu.

252
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
Are there any clues on the body?

253
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,040
There are clues on the body,

254
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,520
but not enough to solve the case.

255
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,179
Both cases are quite strange.

256
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,799
Look.

257
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,320
As for Ma Xiaoquan's death,

258
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
all we know now is

259
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,760
that it's related to those cloths.

260
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,820
But the problem is,

261
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,760
we don't know who tied the knots.

262
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
As for Yang Guang's death, it's even stranger.

263
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,419
We can't even find the weapon.

264
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,040
Based on Yang Guang and Ma Xiaoquan's living arrangements

265
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
and ticket information,

266
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,400
could it be that they committed a crime in the past,

267
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,360
and Ma Xiaoquan killed Yang Guang then committed suicide to escape punishment?

268
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,320
If Ma Xiaoquan killed Yang Guang,

269
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,370
we found no traces at the scene.

270
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,160
Why suicide?

271
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,200
What was the motive?

272
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,460
It doesn't make sense.

273
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,800
If it wasn't suicide,

274
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,040
let's consider homicide.

275
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,960
But these two were joined at the hip.

276
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,760
They didn't contact anyone but each other.

277
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Who else could they have offended?

278
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,320
That's not necessarily true.

279
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,720
They've been living under false identities for eleven years.

280
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,920
It's possible that they really

281
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
offended someone eleven years ago.

282
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,720
To hide like this,

283
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,120
they must have been afraid of retaliation.

284
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
It wasn't a major crime like murder for money.

285
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,890
They shouldn't have to hide like this.

286
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,560
Alright.

287
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,920
Everyone's done eating, right?

288
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
Let's go back and check the files.

289
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,440
Okay.

290
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,840
Boss,

291
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,700
check, please.

292
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,240
Okay.

293
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,440
Dr. Xie.

294
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,680
Xie Tong.

295
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,800
What a coincidence.

296
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
Yeah, I just got off work.

297
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,480
I'm grabbing a bite with them.

298
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,120
Captain Zheng.

299
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,980
You've met him.

300
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,090
And they are?

301
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,520
Jin Jin.

302
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,700
She's a colleague.

303
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,960
And Chen Yishi.

304
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
He's a colleague.

305
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,220
Who is that?

306
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,170
An old flame.

307
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,880
Dr. Xie,

308
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,010
we're heading back.

309
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,520
I'll come for a psych evaluation another day.

310
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,040
Bye.

311
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,920
You like lilies.

312
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
I bought them for a patient.

313
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,800
Aren't you a med student too?

314
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,960
This is called humanistic care.

315
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,760
Learn from it.

316
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,960
First time I've seen such a thoughtful doctor.

317
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
But how can I learn?

318
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
I can only send chrysanthemums.

319
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,680
Lame.

320
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,120
Are you okay?

321
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
It hurts a little.

322
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,600
Should we go to the hospital?

323
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,200
Forget it.

324
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
I was mostly just scared.

325
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,290
But we really shouldn't come here.

326
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,240
I seem to get hurt every time I come.

327
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,100
Last time, I got hurt by accident.

328
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,890
This time, I got hit by a bottle.

329
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,930
Last time...

330
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,450
You still remember?

331
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,280
Stop fighting.

332
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,410
I'll call the police if you don't stop!

333
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,530
Do that again and I'll kill you.

334
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,410
Are you okay?

335
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,160
It hurts.

336
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,720
I don't know if there are glass shards in there.

337
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,400
It's too messy here.

338
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,730
I'll take a look inside.

339
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Gently.

340
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,360
Bear with it.

341
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600
It's so long.

342
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,160
Will it leave a scar?

343
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,200
Don't worry.

344
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
As long as you don't get it wet or scratch it,

345
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,740
you'll be fine.

346
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
It's a pity about our game.

347
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
We didn't even get to play.

348
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,320
It's all ruined.

349
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,120
We have plenty of time.

350
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,160
Let's do it another day.

351
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,720
But midterms are next week.

352
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,880
You should stay home and study.

353
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,080
Look at you.

354
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
What did your dad tell you?

355
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,680
He told you to treat me to good food and drinks.

356
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,360
But look at you.

357
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
If I hadn't called you,

358
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,880
you wouldn't even have sent a text.

359
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,400
Ice pop.

360
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
Here is the proof.

361
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,320
You only bought one ice pop.

362
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,460
I bought it for you.

363
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,120
I don't believe you.

364
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,600
You only bought one anyway.

365
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,930
What's that word again?

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Selfish.

367
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
Inconsiderate.

368
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Hogging food.

369
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,120
What else?

370
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,840
Stop it.

371
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,680
It's just that

372
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,280
I have classes every day from Monday to Friday.

373
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,540
My schedule is packed.

374
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,540
Isn't today Thursday?

375
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
Where did you find the time?

376
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,120
It's because at my house,

377
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,080
the water pipe broke.

378
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,440
My dad made me fix it.

379
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,880
You just got lucky.

380
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm serious.

381
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Lately, especially at night,

382
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,140
you shouldn't go out much.

383
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,130
It's so chaotic over there.

384
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,680
Don't worry about that.

385
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,520
I won't go out until my wound heals.

386
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:40,850
Okay.

387
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,800
I'll go return the medicine.

388
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,280
You,

389
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,360
stay right here.

390
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,800
Wait for me.

391
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,440
Don't move.

392
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,640
I won't move a muscle.

393
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,220
You remember everything now, right?

394
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,560
Back then,

395
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,620
I was just worried about your safety.

396
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,360
True.

397
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,220
That place was pretty dangerous.

398
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,640
Since I got hurt last time,

399
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,770
I haven't been back.

400
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,450
All these years,

401
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
you've been in Jianglin, right?

402
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,820
Why didn't you contact me?

403
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,220
You haven't contacted me either.

404
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,280
I...

405
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,120
I have things to do.

406
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm leaving.

407
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,640
Captain Zheng,

408
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,280
you made me pay for the meal.

409
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,540
You also made me pay for the fruit.

410
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm fine with paying,

411
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,200
but we only bought six in total.

412
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
Six apples and six peaches each.

413
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,200
Luckily we didn't buy just six grapes.

414
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,880
Enough.

415
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,560
When have I not transferred you the money?

416
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
You've been muttering all the way.

417
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,200
True.

418
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
Captain Zheng is too stingy.

419
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,600
He didn't even let me finish my meal.

420
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,080
He sent me off with just a bowl of hot and sour noodles.

421
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,040
And Chen Yishi paid for the meal.

422
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,400
Let's take a break.

423
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,600
Good work, everyone.

424
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,280
Come on.

425
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,040
Have some fruit

426
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,120
and recharge.

427
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,880
This fruit

428
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,840
is my treat,

429
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,250
but Captain Zheng paid.

430
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,120
Don't forget.

431
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,400
Come on.

432
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Dr. Chu.

433
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,970
What good food did you have?

434
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,120
He just treated me to a bowl of hot and sour noodles.

435
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,320
He made me leave before I even finished.

436
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,000
Chen Yishi ended up paying the bill.

437
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,840
Rest a bit longer.

438
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,000
Have some fruit.

439
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,140
Take a look at this one.

440
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I think I found it.

441
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
On June 1, 2007,

442
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
there was a kidnapping and murder case.

443
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,920
Two suspects are still at large.

444
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,720
The victim was Feng Youning

445
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,760
from Jianglin University.

446
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,760
She worked part-time at Tianwaitian Billiards Hall.

447
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,730
This is the ransom note.

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,860
The amount involved was 500,000.

449
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,640
As demanded by the suspects,

450
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
the ransom was left at Tianwaitian.

451
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,650
Captain Yan,

452
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,980
I asked the girl at the front desk.

453
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,600
Feng Youning

454
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,130
switched shifts last week.

455
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,520
Think carefully.

456
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,170
Are you sure you locked the money in this cabinet?

457
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,140
Did you see anyone come to take the money?

458
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,250
I really didn't see anyone.

459
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,760
Do you know where your daughter

460
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,200
usually goes?

461
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,600
Especially

462
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,400
on Thursdays.

463
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,760
If she's not in class

464
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,080
or working,

465
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,410
what would she be doing?

466
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,880
The suspect definitely

467
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,720
staked out the place beforehand

468
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,040
or followed you.

469
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080
The more details you give us,

470
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,580
the faster we can find her.

471
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,520
Stop asking me.

472
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,920
I really don't know.

473
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,320
Aren't you the police?

474
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,680
Go find her!

475
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,800
He called and told me to leave it here and go.

476
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,680
I wanted to wait,

477
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,080
but

478
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,520
he must have been watching me.

479
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,480
He called again.

480
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,720
Told me to drop it and leave.

481
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
If I didn't, he would...

482
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Calm down.

483
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
You should trust the police.

484
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
No call yet?

485
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,280
No.

486
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,160
Since the call yesterday,

487
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,040
until now,

488
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,840
there hasn't been another call.

489
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,320
Get ready to trace the call.

490
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,520
Once a call comes in,

491
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,250
start searching immediately.

492
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
Five hundred thousand

493
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,440
isn't a small amount.

494
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,920
Your family isn't rich. This money...

495
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,960
What do you mean?

496
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
Are you saying I stole the money?

497
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,920
Let me tell you,

498
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,760
to save my daughter,

499
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,800
I'd give my life.

500
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,170
Calm down first.

501
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,520
What we mean is,

502
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,320
in such a short time,

503
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,520
getting that much money

504
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,480
isn't easy.

505
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,940
Why didn't you call the police immediately?

506
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,200
I was scared.

507
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,480
I was scared.

508
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,040
You must have borrowed this money

509
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,079
from relatives and friends.

510
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
That's the money I saved half my life

511
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,760
to buy a house.

512
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
Let me in.

513
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,200
Let me in.

514
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,720
Calm down.

515
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
You can't go in.

516
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
Ningning.

517
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,400
Ningning.

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,760
Ningning.

519
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
Time of death was over 12 hours ago.

520
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,000
Her throat was slit.

521
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,240
Comfort the family.

522
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,760
Step up the investigation.

523
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,240
Yes.

524
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,000
This case...

525
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,050
It left a deep impression on me.

526
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,120
Like a knife

527
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,200
plunged deep into my chest.

528
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,440
Over the years,

529
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,480
we haven't stopped investigating

530
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
the suspects.

531
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
However it turns out now,

532
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
we can finally give the public and the family some closure.

533
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,840
I remember back then,

534
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,130
by the time we arrived at the scene,

535
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,120
five days had already passed.

536
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,600
The victim had already been killed.

537
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,920
It was pouring rain in the mountains.

538
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,080
The scene had been badly destroyed

539
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,440
by the rain.

540
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,290
The ransom had been taken by the suspects.

541
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,680
The only clue we found at the scene

542
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,040
was the ransom note

543
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,720
provided by the victim's family,

544
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,200
and

545
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,040
the location for the ransom drop,

546
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,700
Tianwaitian Billiards Hall.

547
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,840
Afterwards,

548
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,080
we investigated a large number of suspicious individuals,

549
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,680
but found no relevant leads.

550
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,450
What did that man look like?

551
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,480
That man...

552
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,340
was quite tall.

553
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,920
He was wearing a hat

554
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,760
and holding a bag.

555
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,560
What color were his clothes and shoes?

556
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,600
Do you remember?

557
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,560
It was too dark.

558
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,520
I don't remember clearly.

559
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,250
Do you remember the exact time?

560
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,140
Around nine or ten.

561
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,810
Chief Fu.

562
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:05,840
Have a seat.

563
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,800
Listen in.

564
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,080
According to the family's testimony,

565
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,720
the callers from 226739 were two men.

566
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,440
They estimated

567
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,800
they are between 20 and 30 years old.

568
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,600
One of them spoke

569
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,560
the Huishan dialect,

570
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,800
so he is likely an outsider.

571
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,560
Also,

572
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,320
based on the profile of the ransom note,

573
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,000
there are

574
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,560
two types of handwriting in it.

575
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,640
One of the writers

576
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
is impatient

577
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,160
and ruthless.

578
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,640
The other person

579
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,020
might be imitating handwriting.

580
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,680
He's not as bold,

581
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
but he's smarter.

582
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,160
The two of them

583
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,280
used

584
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,560
pieced-together handwriting

585
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,000
to write a ransom note

586
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,080
and sent it to the victim's home.

587
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,800
And the paper used for this ransom note...

588
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,120
It's from the victim's notebook.

589
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
It's her.
