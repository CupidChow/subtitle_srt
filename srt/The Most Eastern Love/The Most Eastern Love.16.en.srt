1
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,920
All done.

2
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you for your hard work.

3
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,980
This is my first time being a bridesmaid.

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,610
It feels quite unfamiliar.

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Manyue,

6
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,560
thank you for agreeing to be my bridesmaid.

7
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,039
Oh my God, I feel like I'm going to cry.

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,960
It's okay, it's okay.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,039
Oh no, please don't cry.

10
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,080
It's alright.

11
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,759
What happened in the past is over now.

12
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,759
You've tamed my brother, Lin Shanhai, that player.

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,640
You're truly saving mankind.

14
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,090
Giving back to society.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,200
I don't know how Shanhai will react

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,960
when he sees me now.

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,600
What should I do?

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,280
How did I suddenly get married?

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,640
I just announced a couple of days ago

20
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,479
that the wanderer of the border town was back in action.

21
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,040
How did it turn out like this now?

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
My Salina,

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,040
Amanda,

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Tingting,

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,280
Jingjing, Feifei,

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
what am I going to do about them now?

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,960
I can't become a slave to love.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I must resist.

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,480
I want freedom.

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,380
When I think about the future,

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,480
could it be

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
could it be

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,160
that I'll start living with Natasha,

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
together through thick and thin?

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,440
Living a lovely life together.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm going to be all lovey-dovey with Natasha.

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,920
spending our lives together in sweet companionship.

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,880
Jealous, aren't you?

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,520
I've got a wife now.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,040
now look at yourself.

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,160
How pathetic.

42
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
How many days has it been?

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,200
Natasha and I are about to get married.

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,040
You're still having a tiff with Man Yue.

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,900
Let me tell you.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,040
Women...

47
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
Lin Shanhai, how could you get married?

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Lin Shanhai, open the door for me!

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,090
Lin Shanhai, come out here!

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,020
Lin Shanhai, open the door for me!

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,970
Lin Shanhai, I know you're inside.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,620
Lin Shanhai, didn't you promise to marry me?

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,440
Lin Shanhai, what am I supposed to do now that you're married?

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,120
It's over.

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,540
My fish pond exploded.

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
How did it happen?

57
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,040
What are you doing?

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,280
Brother, I need to go in.

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,520
Could you escort me out later?

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,920
Please, I'm begging you.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,280
Come out here!

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
You're getting married today.

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,320
What about Natasha if you leave?

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,360
Natasha! Natasha!

65
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,600
Didn't you say I was the one you loved most?

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,480
Natasha!

67
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,040
Natasha!

68
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,560
Natasha!

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,890
Didn't you say I was the one you loved most?

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,240
Oh no, my fish pond is about to explode!

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,520
No, I have to go out.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
You can't go out.

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,920
If you go out now, won't it make things worse?

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,180
What should we do then?

75
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,120
So Lin Shanhai is going to marry Natasha.

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,840
So Natasha is going to marry Lin Shanhai.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,960
That's too much!

78
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
Lin Shanhai! Lin Shanhai!

79
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
Come out here!

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,080
Lin Shanhai, you bastard!

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,800
Natasha is mine!

82
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
She's mine!

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,680
You don't deserve Natasha at all!

84
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,520
Lin Shanhai, come out!

85
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,240
You don't deserve Natasha!

86
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Here comes the wedding crasher.

87
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,300
What are you doing?

88
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,399
Calm down.

89
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,279
Who did they inherit their temper from?

90
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,160
How can I calm down?

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,959
Calm down.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,600
Come out, Lin Shanhai!

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,080
Natasha! Natasha!

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,970
Natasha, come out here!

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,440
Who are you calling?

96
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,200
Come out! How could you get married?

97
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
What are you shouting about?

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,760
Let me see Natasha for a moment.

99
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,240
I... I'll be content with that.

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Who's Natasha?

101
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,520
Miss, we only came after hearing the news.

102
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,400
I just want to see Natasha.

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,640
Is she getting married today?

104
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,520
The whole hotel is for weddings.

105
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm the only one getting married today.

106
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,810
I think you've come to the wrong place.

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,440
Who is she marrying?

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,040
How come I don't know about this?

109
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,200
Calm down. Who is she marrying?

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
Who are you talking about?

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,520
How come I don't know about this?

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,600
Are you deceiving me too?

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,280
Who is she marrying?

114
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,000
Sha.

115
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,080
It's a misunderstanding, isn't it?

116
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,600
What a mess this has turned into.

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,460
What a situation this has become.

118
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
I think I've seen you before.

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,440
You're the Hezhe Treasure.

120
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,520
Yes, yes, yes. I've seen her on TV too.

121
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,250
Are you getting married today?

122
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,300
Yes, I'm the one getting married.

123
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,600
What a situation this has become.

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,280
Um, can I take a picture with you?

125
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,560
It'll bring me some good luck too.

126
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
Take a picture.

127
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,320
Me too, me too!

128
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,960
If there's a bride, there must be a groom, right?

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,440
Why don't you call out the groom too?

130
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,120
Let us see what kind of handsome guy he is.

131
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
Who's worthy of our Hezhe Treasure.

132
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
Who is it, really?

133
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,840
Wife.

134
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,400
So handsome!

135
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
So handsome!

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
They really are a perfect match!

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,560
They want to take a picture with you. Go ahead.

138
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,920
No problem, come on.

139
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,520
Come, come.

140
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,800
Look here, look here.

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
Look here.

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,159
Look here, Hezhe Treasure.

143
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,300
Come on, look here.

144
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,800
What a situation this has become.

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,520
We almost ruined your wedding.

146
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,840
Lin, congratulations on your wedding.

147
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,360
Thank you.

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,159
May you have a happy marriage that lasts a hundred years.

149
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,280
May your love last forever.

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
Handsome, here's a wedding gift from me.

151
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
Remember to treat our Hezhe Treasure well.

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,090
First marriage.

153
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Two hundred yuan.

154
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,300
I'll split it with you.

155
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,040
Thinking about a second marriage already?

156
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,410
Is the bride's makeup done?

157
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Not yet.

158
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm really sorry.

159
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,720
Our on-site lighting equipment

160
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,840
has encountered some issues.

161
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,520
It's too late to repair it now.

162
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,840
So I've borrowed one

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,080
from somewhere else.

164
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,000
But we've lost the previous rehearsal information.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
So I'd like to ask the newlyweds

166
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
to come with me and do a walkthrough.

167
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
To ensure the wedding goes perfectly.

168
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,640
Alright, thank you for your hard work.

169
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,170
I'll go and hurry things up.

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Natasha.

171
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,460
Why is the door locked?

172
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Natasha.

173
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,960
Manyue.

174
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,880
I might have eaten a bit too much these past few days.

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,680
I can't zip up the wedding dress.

176
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,560
You.

177
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,980
Is the bride ready?

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,860
We're really running out of time.

179
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,480
Manyue.

180
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,040
I'll be ready in a moment.

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,400
Lin Shanhai.

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,480
What's wrong? Wasn't everything fine just now?

183
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,520
Why are you rushing me?

184
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,560
Nature calls. I've got diarrhea.

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,880
Where is he?

186
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
He's got diarrhea.

187
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,720
Bro, are you kidding me?

188
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,040
at such a crucial moment,

189
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,800
you

190
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,000
the lighting technician is waiting for you to do a walkthrough.

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,040
Boss, tell them to wait a bit longer.

192
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Just a moment.

193
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Where's Natasha?

194
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,360
She's in the bathroom too.

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,420
changing clothes.

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
Are you done yet?

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,610
We'll be late if we don't leave now.

198
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,640
Bro, I'm out.

199
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,520
Hurry up.

200
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
I can't come out, I can't come out.

201
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,920
I'm having diarrhea. How can I come out?

202
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,300
This is the fourth time

203
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,820
I've seen his back.

204
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,220
You're crying.

205
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,480
Next,

206
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,000
let's witness this happy moment together.

207
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,160
May I invite the newlyweds

208
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,560
to exchange their rings of love.

209
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,480
Please place the ring on each other's ring finger.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,530
May I invite the newlyweds.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,760
to exchange their vows of love.

212
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Natasha,

213
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I will definitely carry this moment

214
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,800
to my grave.

215
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Me too.

216
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,840
Okay.

217
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,360
Manyue,

218
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,040
come back to Guangxi with me.

219
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,400
Phone.

220
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,360
Hello?
