1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
Jun Nan.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,760
Feng Xiang.

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,840
Qiang.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,720
qiang.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,600
Hang.

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,320
Zhen Lin.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,040
Las Genglin Tonghui Yinglehan.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,640
Jun Tongming Xin.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,520
Liang.

10
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,440
Yueyue.

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm here, Yueyue.

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,759
Yueyue.

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
I'm here.

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,680
Yueyue.

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,360
Yueyue.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,960
Let's hurry and leave.

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,400
Don't pay attention to him.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Let's deal with it as it comes.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's see what he's up to.

20
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,400
Yueyue.

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,700
Yueyue.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,460
Yueyue.

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,259
Yueyue.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,000
Yue.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,960
Yueyue.

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,320
Yueyue.

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,440
You say, in this vast wilderness,

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
that the two of us could meet by chance,

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,920
this...

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,220
this must be destiny's arrangement!

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
What nonsense are you spouting now?

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm not talking nonsense.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm looking for bears.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,060
Looking for bears?

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
Why are you looking for bears?

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
Of course, to prove

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,600
that I'm better than you.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
Do you dare to accept the challenge?

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,240
Challenge?

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,340
Starting from now,

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,079
whoever photographs an albino bear first

42
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,140
will be the winner.

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
Only the winner

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,170
deserves to have my Yueyue.

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
What do you think Man Yue is?

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
A bet.

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,840
Yueyue, don't be angry.

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,960
That's not what I meant.

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
I was confused by him.

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,800
Sha Tang, if you're a real man,

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
you'll accept my challenge.

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,680
Prove it with your abilities.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,210
Who truly deserves Yueyue.

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,079
I don't want to bother with you.

55
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,960
You're still pushing it, aren't you?

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,760
Aren't you asking for a beating?

57
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,090
Where did you get such confidence?

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,520
I have one hundred percent.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,680
No, two hundred.

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
Three hundred percent confidence.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,800
What's this?

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
Bear fur.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm about to find the albino bear.

64
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,280
I advise you, Zhong Ziqing,

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,160
you'd better leave quickly.

66
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Otherwise, when you really find that bear,

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,660
it'll be too late for regrets.

68
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,010
On what grounds?

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,700
I just made a bet, and you're asking me to give up.

70
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,180
You think you'll lose?

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,720
You think I, the richest man in Dongji, am stupid?

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,520
Not stupid.

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,690
I believe in you.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,840
Yueyue, you believe in me?

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
Yueyue, I believe in you.

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
You can find it.

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
I knew you believed in me.

78
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
You'll definitely find it.

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,480
Now I have four hundred percent confidence.

80
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,079
Let's go.

81
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,160
Yes, sir.

82
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,840
Yueyue.

83
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,520
Let's go.

84
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,800
Who gave him wolf fur?

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,820
Let him go search for wolves then.

86
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,800
Let's go.

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,500
What are you doing over there?

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
It's going to snow heavily soon.

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,360
Let's go.

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,610
Come quickly, you guys!

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
The snow line in this area,

92
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,540
look, it's quite strange.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Yes, yes, yes.

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,680
This should be the traces left by the polar bear.

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
This snow line

96
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,760
is its movement path.

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,090
Let's go.

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,580
Come on.

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,320
Let's go over and take a look.

100
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,180
I almost stepped on it.

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
Luckily, I didn't step on it.

102
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,280
It hasn't frozen yet.

103
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,740
within the last half hour,

104
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,810
the bear must be nearby.

105
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,920
Manyue.

106
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
It's that polar bear.

107
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,520
Come back.

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,980
The sound is wrong.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
It's okay. That sound isn't directed at me.

110
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,360
We'll be back in two minutes.

111
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,840
Be careful.

112
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,360
Come back here. Quick, grab him.

113
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,120
Hold him back.

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,640
In these mountains, my sister's words are gospel.

115
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,040
Don't make things worse.

116
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,440
What? What are you doing?

117
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,320
What?

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,800
No.

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,520
I've got him.

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,480
Manyue, Manyue.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,320
Natasha, what are you trying to do?

122
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,120
Don't go.

123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,360
I need to go help her.

124
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
What if the bear goes berserk?

125
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,650
She can't handle it.

126
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,360
Why are these women getting crazier and crazier?

127
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,120
Let go of me, Manyue.

128
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,120
Manyue.

129
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,040
Manyue.

130
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,560
Manyue, are you okay?

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Man Yue.

132
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
Man Yue, are you alright?

133
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,680
Let me see.

134
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
Let me see. I got it on camera.

135
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,000
Are you okay? Are you okay, Man Yue?

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,800
Natasha.

137
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,530
Are you okay?

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,860
Let me tell you.

139
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,720
Come here.

140
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,960
I photographed a polar bear.

141
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,040
The albino version is complete now.

142
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
Look quickly.

143
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Hurry up.

144
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,040
Yueyue.

145
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,880
Why?

146
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,660
People die for wealth.

147
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,320
Birds perish for food.

148
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,650
So, was everything you did for me fake too?

149
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,840
Natasha, you liar!

150
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
Is money that important to you?

151
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,880
You'd do anything for money, wouldn't you?

152
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
Would you betray anyone for it?

153
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,640
Shan Hai.

154
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,640
Aren't you also doing it for love,

155
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,280
betraying Yueyue's whereabouts

156
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,320
by spying for me?

157
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,280
I...

158
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
Isn't that right?

159
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,680
Lin Shan Hai, you're my own brother.

160
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,520
How could you betray me?

161
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,280
You're spying for Zhong Ziqing?

162
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,760
Alright, alright.

163
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,720
Do you even care about me as your sister?

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,120
Enough, enough, enough.

165
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,280
I'll deal with you later.

166
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,890
Can you give me back the camera now?

167
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,880
Yueyue.

168
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,530
The game isn't over yet.

169
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,200
Let me settle this with him first.

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,130
Then I'll return the camera to you.

171
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,130
You like to play games, huh?

172
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,920
You really like to play, don't you?

173
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,240
I'll let you play today, I'll let you play.

174
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,280
You love to play.

175
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,400
We haven't determined a winner yet.

176
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,680
Who knows if he actually took the photos?

177
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,320
Don't be a sore loser and resort to daylight robbery.

178
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,250
Little brother,

179
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,120
this is called making good use of the rules.

180
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,580
Come on.

181
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,280
Let's see what the great photographer Sha

182
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,720
has been obsessing over with this little polar bear.

183
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,980
What does it look like?

184
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,160
Can you return the camera to us now?

185
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,920
Is it fun?

186
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,800
They say it's far, far up in the white clouds.

187
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,680
They say it's near, close to the heart.

188
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,200
They say she's far, in the North and East Poles.

189
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,560
They say she's near, in my homeland.

190
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Whether she's near or far,

191
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,840
her beauty is undeniable.

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,720
The first note of a boat song is the most touching.

193
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,840
The first breeze of morning is the sweetest.

194
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,920
It's not far from here.

195
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,680
It's just that the evening breeze of Wusuli

196
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,200
is a bit lingering.

197
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,360
It's not far from here.

198
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,840
It's just that the stories of the birch forest

199
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,040
are a bit entangling.

200
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,280
It's not far from here.

201
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,480
It's just that the melody of the Errenzhuan

202
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,800
has a touch of romance.
