1
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,960
Thank you very much for your visit, Manager Zhao.

2
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,200
I wonder, after tasting our

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,960
Qianweina products,

4
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,289
what are your thoughts?

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,160
The taste is quite standard,

6
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,520
and the brand advantage is very obvious.

7
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,560
However, what stands out in this cultural tourism conference

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,720
is the showcase of local cultural tourism products.

9
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,600
I've heard

10
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,900
there's another local brewery called Liangjiang.

11
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,520
I need to examine their products

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,100
before making a decision.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,729
I understand

14
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
Manager Zhao's serious and responsible attitude towards work

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,759
is worth learning from.

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,680
Well, after I've examined Liangjiang beer,

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,720
we'll talk again.

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,759
Alright.

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,680
Try this.

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,560
Boss Zhong has arrived.

21
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,240
Yueyue,

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,000
do you know who in the world

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,460
understands you the most?

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,760
do you know who in the world

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,480
loves you the most?

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,920
Do you know who is

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,240
the sole agent of Qianweina in all of Dongji?

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,079
To be honest,

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,720
it's me.

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
What are you trying to say?

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Our father is a

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
My father-in-law is

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,480
Uncle Lin

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,760
Uncle Lin

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,640
Uncle Lin is a sentimental person.

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
I shouldn't say much about business matters,

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,240
but

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,960
now that you're running Liangjiang Distillery,

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
the situation is different.

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,680
As long as you sign this merger contract

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320
and agree to marry me.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
What are you doing?

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,840
You're truly a businessman after all.

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,960
You make taking advantage of the situation sound so sincere.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,280
Business is ruthless.

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,520
But my feelings for Yueyue are genuine.

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,380
What can you, a mere photographer, compete with me?

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,240
Try this.

49
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,780
Will you try it?

50
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,880
Yes, yes, I'll try it.

51
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
This is...

52
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
Good wine.

53
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,080
This is what you call...

54
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,760
...the new product developed by me and the 'shutter presser'.

55
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,120
The soon-to-be-rising taste of Dongji.

56
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,280
Yueyue.

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,360
We are family.

58
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,600
Give up the struggle.

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Such a good product

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,440
should be your dowry,

61
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,000
rather than Liangjiang Distillery's

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
desperate struggle tool.

63
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,320
My options

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
never included marrying you.

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
If you don't marry me,

66
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Liangjiang will disappear from the market

67
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,520
in a week at most.

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,650
Just three days.

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
Our newly developed product

70
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,500
will replace your Qianweina.

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,880
Let's go.

72
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
It's like an old lady getting into bed,

73
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,610
you've made this old man laugh.

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Manyue, love and business are the same.

75
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,080
choose the safe option if you're going to choose.

76
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
at the very least, a stock with potential will do.

77
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,920
Get out.

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,560
Let's go.

79
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,250
Pour me a glass to taste.

80
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,400
Hello?

81
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,880
Manager Zhao from the procurement department of the Cultural Tourism Conference.

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,040
We need to go to Liangjiang Distillery tomorrow.

83
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,600
Got it?

84
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,480
I heard from Lin Shanhai.

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,940
You know what to do, right?

86
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
Are you asking me to poison someone?

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,880
I'll be deported.

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,570
It's a society ruled by law.

89
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,680
Something really happened at Liangjiang Distillery.

90
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,740
What's in it for me?

91
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,360
This task is too difficult.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
The money has been transferred.

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Alright, boss.

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,180
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

95
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,460
I've been up all night.

96
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,320
You should go back and rest early.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,920
It's okay.

98
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,960
We're running out of time.

99
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,420
Let me help you take notes.

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,080
every bubble

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,170
captures a ray of sunlight.

102
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,480
Nice shot.

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,500
Really?

104
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,280
I've noticed your secondary account is more

105
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,880
lifelike than your main one.

106
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,080
I have a reputation to uphold.

107
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
I'm not in control of my own life.

108
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,380
Only on my alt account can I be myself.

109
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,880
It's a good thing you wanted to be yourself.

110
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,080
Otherwise, we wouldn't have had the chance to meet later.

111
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,520
What chance?

112
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
The chance for you to meet Bai Xiong.

113
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,810
Tell me about yourself.

114
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,159
What should I say?

115
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,440
I've already told you about my most important whitening plan,

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
I've told you everything.

117
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,370
Won't you let me get to know you?

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Based on my understanding of wildlife,

119
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,520
no,

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
what I mean is,

121
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,360
due to the attention cultivated by my profession,

122
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,800
I noticed that your main account

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,320
always posts works under the name of Hezhe's Treasure,

124
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,680
while your secondary account never mentions your name.

125
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,840
Because Hezhe's Treasure

126
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
is a role model in everyone's eyes,

127
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,440
so you have to be very careful about being yourself.

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,760
You have to carefully filter

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,840
every post you make,

130
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,370
afraid of making a mistake.

131
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,520
But on the 'First Ray of Sunlight' account,

132
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,280
you can be free to do as you please.

133
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,600
You don't have to put on a brave face,

134
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,799
you don't have to pretend.

135
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,720
It might seem a bit split,

136
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,200
but I want to say

137
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,760
that people actually have two sides to them.

138
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,890
Life is the same way.

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,520
As a wildlife photographer,

140
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
in a year's time,

141
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I spend half of it developing photos in a darkroom

142
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,050
and half shooting animals in the wild.

143
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,720
Sometimes,

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,650
I might go several days without speaking.

145
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,170
But I've noticed that during this period,

146
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,520
I've said all I would normally say in a year.

147
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
I want to understand you.

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,480
I won't pop up anymore.

149
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
What do you mean by 'pop up'?

150
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,660
I won't pop up anymore.

151
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,840
What's wrong?

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,600
Pectinase.

153
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,160
It's over. The fermentation has stopped.

154
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,680
No.

155
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,450
Is there time to start over?

156
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
Manager Zhao will be here by noon.

157
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,480
Do you think we have enough time?

158
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,880
It's the taste of cranberry.

159
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,000
It's quite unique.

160
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,200
But there seems to be a hint of pectinase.

161
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,600
That's because we adjusted

162
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,400
the proportion of wild berries,

163
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,960
to simulate a

164
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,160
flavor of frost-kissed fruit.

165
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,480
Like the first ray of sunlight

166
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,610
through a birch forest in the morning.

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,840
Not bad.

168
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,200
It's indeed much more interesting than standardized products.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
So, Manager Zhao, can we

170
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
continue to move forward with our cooperation?

171
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,570
Your flavor has made it to the final round.

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,690
There's just one competitor left.

173
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,560
Zhong Ziqing.

174
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Manager Zhao, could you come again tomorrow?

175
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,600
Our product

176
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,280
will have one final upgrade.

177
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,210
You can upgrade it further?

178
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,060
I'm looking forward to it.

179
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,480
It's all because Zhong Ziqing forced me to use my trump card.

180
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
What trump card that even your brother doesn't know about?

181
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm not overthinking this,

182
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,400
who has free access to the winery's production area?

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,600
and who could add pectinase to the wine?

184
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,720
Natasha.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
But why would she do that?

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,890
How would I know?

187
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,140
Let's upgrade the formula first.

188
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,890
How do we upgrade it?

189
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,160
Funnel.

190
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,370
Cover it.

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,960
This is a family heirloom.

192
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,890
Traditional pine needle extract.

193
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
Isn't that too risky?

194
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,980
We haven't even tested any proportions.

195
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
As for the proportions, well...

196
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,720
It's up to you.

197
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,520
Just experiment gradually.
