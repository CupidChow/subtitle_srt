1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,240
Jun Nan.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,760
Feng Xiang.

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,720
Qiang.

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,600
Hang.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,320
Zhen Lin.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,000
Las Genglin Tonghui Yingluo Han.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,640
Jun Tongming Xin.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Liang.

9
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,440
Natasha, take a break.

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,370
It's time to eat.

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,479
This battle,

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,000
even the last place is within the top 100 in the province.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,039
Let's just forget about it.

14
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,170
we can't win anyway.

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,800
I learned this from Zhong Ziqing.

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,410
until the very last moment,

17
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,960
never give up.

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Learning unreliable things from unreliable people.

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,759
Natasha, come on.

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,220
You really can be a sparring partner.

21
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,570
Who are you looking down on?

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280
Come on.

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,360
One, two.

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,520
One, two.

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
One, two, one, two.

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,680
One, two, one, two.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,639
One, two.

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,320
That's pretty cool.

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,600
One, two, stop.

30
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,820
Your hand dropped.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
You're asking for a beating.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,800
I wonder who taught you that.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,200
Where are your footsteps?

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,280
How are you supposed to fight with those footsteps?

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Didn't the person who taught you know how to teach footwork?

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,000
Who taught you footwork?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
I learned it on my own.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,210
Your foundation is decent.

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,120
Who can you hit with such soft punches?

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,850
Strength is also fundamental.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
Didn't the person who taught you know to teach you about strength?

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,130
What do you mean?

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,490
Come on, let me see what's going on.

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,480
let me see what's wrong.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880
what, what's happening?

46
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,240
I see you're implying something.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280
Who are you hinting at?

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
No, I'm just teaching Natasha here.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
I see you know a thing or two.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
Just a little.

51
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,120
It doesn't seem like just a little.

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,780
Let's give it a try, you and me.

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,660
Let's have a round.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
Natasha is a beginner.

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Even beginners need strict training.

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,960
Right.

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,880
Let me learn from you.

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,680
One, two.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,200
Stay steady.

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
One, two.

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Okay, okay, okay.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm tired.

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,080
Strength.

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,760
I have strength.

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,680
Well, I'm tired today.

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,400
Strength.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Tired, tired.

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,680
You've learned before, you've also trained.

69
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
I can tell.

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,040
Yes, yes, that's right.

71
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
I can tell.

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,600
I can tell, you've trained before.

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,400
I have no strength left today.

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,320
Come on, come back, come back, come back.

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,170
Here you are.

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,079
What time is it now?

77
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,200
You're drinking here?

78
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,640
This is my reward to myself.

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,079
To rediscover myself.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,920
To bid farewell to painful memories.

81
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,400
The master of picking up girls in Fuyuan is back in the game.

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,440
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.

83
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't fish yourself out later, okay?

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,730
I'm leaving.

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,720
Lin Shanhai, you may not know

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
this boxing match

87
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,320
how significant it is to me.

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm not just seeking your forgiveness,

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,770
but also bidding farewell to my past self.

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,040
So,

91
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,320
to win,

92
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,920
I must work hard

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
to show everyone my determination.

94
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,800
First to enter is the blue corner fighter, Shi Tong.

95
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,280
Her record is eighteen wins, one draw, and two losses,

96
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,680
with ten knockouts.

97
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,080
Next to enter is the red corner fighter.

98
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,560
Her record is zero wins, zero losses, and zero knockouts.

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,320
She is Natasha from Russia.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,680
As the only non-professional fighter in this match,

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,400
what kind of performance will she bring us?

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Let's wait and see.

103
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,490
Why wouldn't I come?

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
Remember what we taught you.

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
if you can't win, run.

106
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
See? I'm useless too.

107
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,050
Maybe we should call it off.

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,040
Come on, you can do it!

109
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
No headbutting.

110
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,160
No hitting the back of the head.

111
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
No elbowing.

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,240
No hitting below the belt. Understood?

113
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,840
Fighters, touch gloves.

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,400
Begin.

115
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,640
Yizhen Boxing: Legend of Zhen Wu

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,120
How was that? I told you my teaching was good.

117
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,159
Power steps.

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,300
It's all your teaching, all of it.

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,120
Keep it up!

120
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,440
Natasha throws the first punch.

121
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
A series of combination punches.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
She has already forced Shi Tong into a corner.

123
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,860
What an impressive display of force!

124
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,760
The situation on the field has changed.

125
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
Shi Tong suddenly changes her tactics.

126
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,159
I'm out of energy.

127
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,600
Natasha, stay steady.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
Natasha.

129
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Hold on.

130
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
We can see that

131
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Shi Tong has started

132
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,320
to wear down Natasha's stamina.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,850
Natasha's several swings miss their target.

134
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,720
Let go!

135
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,920
Foul!

136
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,840
Red card! Penalize her!

137
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,280
Please remain quiet.

138
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
No elbowing allowed.

139
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,919
Blue side loses one point, one point deducted.

140
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,640
I can't go on, I'm exhausted.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,679
Begin.

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,680
Shi Tong seizes the opportunity.

143
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,040
Natasha is forced into a corner.

144
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,370
She strikes Natasha's abdomen fiercely.

145
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,280
Natasha, if you can't continue, let's stop.

146
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,920
Forfeit.

147
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,040
Please forfeit, okay, Natasha?

148
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,280
Please forfeit, Natasha, okay?

149
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Can you hear me?

150
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,960
Natasha.

151
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,600
Please forfeit, okay?

152
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,480
Towel.

153
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,640
My Sha.

154
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,210
Stop fighting, stop fighting.

155
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,600
Don't throw in the towel.

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,520
If you don't throw in the towel, you'll suffer.

157
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,200
Get lost.

158
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,900
I will definitely keep fighting.

159
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,280
Round two.

160
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,120
Begin.

161
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,440
Stop.

162
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,720
Two.

163
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,880
Three.

164
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,880
Four.

165
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,120
Five.

166
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,960
Seven.

167
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,970
Can we continue?

168
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,760
Begin.

169
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,690
You throw it. Give me the towel.

170
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,280
Two.

171
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,840
Four.

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,160
Five.

173
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,440
Six.

174
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,330
Can we continue?

175
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
Ready, begin.

176
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,560
Three.

177
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,800
four,

178
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,120
five,

179
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,440
six,

180
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,520
seven.

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,890
Can we continue?

182
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
Natasha.

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,920
Natasha.

184
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,880
I love you.

185
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,720
They say he's far, far up in the white clouds.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,600
They say he's near, close to the heart.

187
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,120
They say she's far, in the North and East Poles.

188
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
They say she's near, in my homeland.

189
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Whether she's near or far,

190
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,760
her beauty is undeniable.

191
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,640
The first note of a boat song is the most touching.

192
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,760
The first breeze of morning is the sweetest.

193
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,840
It's not far from here.

194
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,600
It's just the evening breeze of Ussuri,

195
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,120
a bit lingering.

196
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,280
It's not far from here.

197
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,760
It's just the story of the birch forest,

198
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,960
with a touch of tenderness.

199
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,200
It's not far from here.

200
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,400
It's just the melody of Er'renzhuan,

201
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,640
with strands of romance.
