1
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Lin Manyue.

2
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,920
You came to see me.

3
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,570
First time, huh?

4
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,570
I'm here to talk.

5
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,420
Let's cut to the chase.

6
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,800
Why did I come to see you?

7
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,210
You know why, don't you?

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Did I accidentally

9
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,240
promote a Hezhe star

10
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,759
and threaten your position?

11
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,920
I don't care who you want to promote.

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,800
But if you continue to spread rumors and smear me

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,120
and our family's winery,

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,640
then we'll have to clash.

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,320
Miss Lin Manyue,

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,880
please mind your words.

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,880
Do you know the consequences

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,600
of baselessly accusing

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,380
the city's most renowned entrepreneur?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
The boss has spoken.

21
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,360
From now on, you need to cause a disturbance every day.

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,690
The more people you organize, the better.

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,200
What if we're caught and tested at the hospital?

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
Won't that expose us?

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Didn't I fire you already?

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,079
Even if you hold a grudge against me,

27
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,410
you shouldn't cause trouble for Miss Lin.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
Yes, yes.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
I'm sorry, Miss Lin.

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
I was confused for a moment.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
Everything was done by me alone.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,380
It has nothing to do with our boss.

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,280
What's inside this?

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
You should know very well, right?

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
If I hand this over to the police,

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,120
where do you think you'll spend the rest of your life?

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,880
I did it.

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,420
It has nothing to do

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,410
with our boss, our former boss.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,800
Miss Lin,

41
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,160
there are too many people

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,560
who hold grudges against me like this.

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,380
It's difficult for me too.

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,600
So I guess we're done talking for today.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,440
Take care.

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,650
Don't see me out.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,640
Goodbye.

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,880
Boss.

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,200
So, in the future, we still...

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
There's no us.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
Only you.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,660
Sister Manyue,

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,079
Lu Manyue.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,400
My name is Lu Xiaowan.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,960
that name is

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,200
That idiot gave you that name, didn't he?

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,160
Sister Manyue, about what happened online,

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,840
I only found out when I watched the replay yesterday.

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,760
I just learned about it.

60
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,960
I didn't mean to go along with Mr. Zhong's plan.

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,079
I had no intention of smearing your reputation.

62
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,640
From what I know about that idiot,

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,800
I can guess what happened without you telling me.

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,660
Sister Manyue,

65
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm actually your fan.

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
it was because I watched

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,520
one of your performances from a long time ago

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,040
that I got the idea to study the Hezhe

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,840
intangible cultural heritage.

70
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,040
It just so happened that Mr. Zhong approached me.

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,360
But I didn't expect

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,560
to become his tool for slandering you.

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,360
Thank you for liking me

74
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
and consequently becoming interested in the Hezhe intangible cultural heritage.

75
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
If you have the chance, learn well from your master.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,320
But

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
don't ever be swayed by that idiot's

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,279
vulgar, boring,

79
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,480
nonsensical,

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,000
and flashy business tactics.

81
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,960
Thank you, Sister Manyue.

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
I won't listen to that idiot anymore.

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,080
Good luck.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,840
Hold a press conference in the name of the winery.

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
The time is 1:30 PM.

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,720
I can't cover for you every time.

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,840
Come here.

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,810
How's your practice going?

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,880
Boss Zhong, I...

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm asking you.

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,370
How long until you can surpass Lin Manyue?

92
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I don't want to work for you anymore.

93
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,720
What?

94
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,080
I said I don't want to study here anymore.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm learning Hezhe culture

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,840
to inherit intangible cultural heritage,

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
not to become your tool against Lin Manyue.

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,280
You...

99
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
You're just an idiot.

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,890
How much did they pay you this time?

101
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,360
They also said,

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,400
if we can provoke Lin Manyue to lose her temper,

103
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
and ruin her public image,

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,060
the bonus will be doubled.

105
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,640
Okay.

106
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,480
Hello, my friends from the press,

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I am Lin Manyue.

108
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,400
I am the so-called 'Treasure of Hezhe' you've been talking about,

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,600
and also the director of Liangjiang Brewery.

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
I believe everyone

111
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,880
has many questions about the brewery and me personally

112
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,800
that you'd like to ask recently.

113
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,400
I will answer all of your questions here.

114
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Miss Lin, recently many people have reported

115
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,000
that after drinking your White Bear beer,

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,920
they experienced vomiting and diarrhea.

117
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,200
How do you explain this?

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,040
After our investigation and confirmation,

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,160
this is an organized and premeditated

120
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,880
malicious business competition incident.

121
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
What evidence have you gathered?

122
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,400
Spreading rumors about quality issues at Liangjiang Brewery

123
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,600
Formally apologize to Liangjiang Brewery.

124
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,010
Time is limited.

125
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,320
the full video

126
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
will be released later on

127
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,180
Liangjiang's official account.

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,120
Next question.

129
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,120
You accepted the proposal from a local renowned entrepreneur,

130
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
Mr. Zhong Ziqing,

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
but then cheated and called off the engagement.

132
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,170
How do you explain this?

133
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,240
When did I accept his proposal?

134
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,560
Do you have any evidence?

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,600
Since there's no evidence,

136
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
then with his repeated actions,

137
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,400
can I sue him for harassment?

138
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
Who can prove it?

139
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,480
Such a big boss,

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,810
why would he harass you?

141
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,280
This reporter, sir, you look very familiar to me.

142
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,800
You were causing trouble at the entrance of Liangjiang Brewery before,

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
weren't you?

144
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,800
I still have the video recorded on my phone.

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,330
You dare to come here again?

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,960
My reporter friend,

147
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,280
if I see you again next time,

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,700
bring some more substantial questions.

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,200
Regarding the food safety issues at the brewery,

150
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,130
I don't need to explain again, do I?

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,040
Excuse me, Miss Lin,

152
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,160
as the treasure of Hezhe, you were photographed frequenting bars

153
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
and you have an illegitimate child.

154
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,840
Doesn't this damage your image?

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,010
Let me answer your first question.

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,280
I am the treasure of Hezhe,

157
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,360
but I'm also a person.

158
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
According to your logic,

159
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,480
should all bars be closed?

160
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,160
They shouldn't even exist.

161
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Speaking of bars,

162
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,640
let me make an advertisement.

163
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Everyone is welcome

164
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,080
to support my brother's 'Lai Ri Fang Chang' bar.

165
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
If you happen to meet the treasure of Hezhe at the bar,

166
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,460
I'll treat everyone to a free bottle of White Bear beer.

167
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,320
To answer your second question,

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,780
my journalist friend,

169
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
before you try to smear me,

170
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
could you please do your homework?

171
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Given my age,

172
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,400
how could I possibly have given birth to

173
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
such a grown child?

174
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,560
When you ask this question,

175
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,480
don't you feel

176
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,520
that you're

177
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,720
Miss Lin, as the Hezhe Treasure,

178
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,280
what's your view on

179
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,000
the recently emerged newcomer,

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the Hezhe Star?

181
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,200
As it happens,

182
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
I just met her recently.

183
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,240
This young lady,

184
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,720
I have a pretty good impression of her.

185
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,920
So I hope everyone

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,880
won't pit us against each other.

187
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,280
After all, we're not competing products.

188
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,840
Moreover, we're doing the same thing:

189
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,120
promoting traditional Chinese culture.

190
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,880
Therefore,

191
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,240
I hope everyone will stop using boring business wars

192
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,040
to drag us into conflict,

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,640
especially this young lady.

194
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,200
After listening to your speech just now,

195
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
I have a feeling

196
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
that every word you've said today,

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
every matter you've discussed,

198
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
seems to be directed at Mr. Zhong Ziqing.

199
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
Is that so?

200
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm addressing everyone who, without evidence,

201
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
deliberately tries to smear me.

202
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,320
By the way,

203
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,960
our Liang Jiang official account

204
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,680
is live streaming right now.

205
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
Every word spoken here,

206
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,640
every action,

207
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,480
every event

208
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,960
is being broadcast unedited.

209
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
Do any of you reporters have any more questions?

210
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,800
I will answer honestly here.

211
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,490
Are there any other questions?

212
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,560
Then today's press conference comes to an end.

213
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,360
Thank you all for your hard work.

214
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,240
A bunch of useless fools.

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Boss, what should we do now?

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
Public opinion and reputation have started to turn against us.

217
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,040
What else can we do?

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,120
Go suppress it.

219
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
Boss Zhong, Boss Zhong.

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,520
Boss! Boss! Boss!

221
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,800
Boss, I don't know why,

222
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,880
but starting five minutes ago,

223
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,600
distributors from all over have been calling,

224
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,120
demanding early termination of their purchase contracts.

225
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,800
The Chianvina headquarters also called,

226
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,480
questioning whether we've engaged in unfair practices,

227
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,040
and if the allegations of suppressing competitors are true.

228
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,520
Boss, given the current situation,

229
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,480
should we organize a press conference

230
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
to expand our product promotion?

231
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,640
Regarding the headquarters' inquiry,

232
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,080
how should we respond?

233
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,520
Get out! Get out! Get out!

234
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,480
Get out.

235
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,360
Xiaoyi: 100,000 boxes of goods and returns.

236
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,760
Xiaoyi: 100,000 boxes of goods and returns.

237
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
Xiaoyi: 100,000 boxes of goods and returns.

238
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,360
I... I didn't promote any products during my livestream.

239
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,960
That's strange then.

240
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,720
I thought during your livestream...

241
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,040
you had brought in some business.

242
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,680
I...

243
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,520
Even if the livestream was effective,

244
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,960
it couldn't have happened this quickly, right?

245
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,290
I was wondering whether to tell you or not.

246
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,450
Because of all those rumors out there,

247
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,840
our family...

248
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
We haven't received any new orders for a while.

249
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,080
Today when I opened the express delivery,

250
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,120
I was shocked.

251
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,690
Look at this.

252
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,880
The contract seems to have been sent from Guangxi.

253
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,420
Mine... Hold on a second, Dad.

254
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,040
Hello?

255
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,600
Mom? Mom?

256
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,760
This is Li Jiahao.

257
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,280
Jiahao.

258
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,720
Little Jiahao.

259
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,840
What made you decide to call me?

260
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,700
I just wanted to ask you...

261
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,240
The surprise Dad prepared for you,

262
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,320
did you receive it?

263
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,200
Lin's Beer.
