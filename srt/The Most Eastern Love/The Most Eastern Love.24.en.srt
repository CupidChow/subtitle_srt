1
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,520
The so-called white bear

2
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,440
has led me all over Dongji.

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,880
Who is it?

4
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,320
What exactly is its purpose?

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,639
Please.

6
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,760
A rather strange person.

7
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,720
If I tell you

8
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,250
that a bear just came by, would you believe me?

9
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,720
Everyone, look!

10
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,980
The Hezhe treasure! The Hezhe treasure!

11
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,640
Please.

12
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,600
A polar bear has escaped.

13
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,960
It's broad daylight at the fish museum.

14
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,760
There should be bears here.

15
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,290
Everyone at the fish market has already fled.

16
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,920
It's an easter egg, isn't it?

17
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Are you messing with me?

18
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,800
Who are you?

19
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Take off the mask, take off the mask.

20
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
Zhong Ziqing, what are you up to now?

21
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,600
Are you having another fit?

22
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,520
No, Yueyue, let me explain.

23
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,640
What is there to explain?

24
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,280
Shouldn't you be watching Lu Xiaowan's rehearsal right now?

25
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,560
What are you doing? What are you rehearsing?

26
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,160
Are you rehearsing Boonie Bears here?

27
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,520
Didn't we agree on everything yesterday?

28
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
and now you're starting again today.

29
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,280
I've noticed something about you.

30
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,000
You really...

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,480
I'm going to beat you up today. I'll beat you!

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,200
Yueyue,

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Yueyue, Yueyue.

34
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,800
Look.

35
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,280
Ganging up on me, huh?

36
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Take off that mask.

37
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,780
And who are you?

38
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,560
Take it off.

39
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
Who is it? Who are you?

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,440
Take it off.

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,080
Lin Shanhai, is your brain...

42
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,880
No, no, boss.

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,760
Have you lost your mind?

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
How did you end up playing with Zhong Ziqing?

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,960
Let me explain, let me explain.

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Don't explain.

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,090
Don't call me boss anymore.

48
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,440
Dad,

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
how did you end up playing with them too?

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,760
Are you going through a second childhood?

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,820
What are you doing?

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,760
What are you doing?

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,760
What are you doing?

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Didn't I tell you

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,420
not to mention this person again?

56
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,360
Whose idea was this?

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
It wasn't my idea.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Not me.

59
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Not me, not me.

60
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,480
It was my idea.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,840
If I haven't had the chance to leave yet,

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,920
does it mean I'm not coming back?

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,170
You told me yesterday not to come back,

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,280
so I can only say I haven't had the chance to comply,

65
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,080
rather than refusing to comply.

66
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,880
These polar bears today,

67
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,040
the paths they've accompanied you on,

68
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,970
are all paths we've walked before.

69
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,800
I hope that for every step in the future,

70
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,060
I can be there with you.

71
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,210
I'm not leaving.

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,580
I want to stay here,

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
because I've met someone

74
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,580
who I cherish even more than that polar bear.

75
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,040
These are all my most satisfying works,

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,600
but this last one

77
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
is the perfect ending to this piece.

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,520
The love of my life.

79
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
To capture these adorable little animals,

80
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
I've traveled across the entire country,

81
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,090
from south to north,

82
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
from west to east.

83
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
And at the last stop,

84
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,180
I happened to capture you,

85
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,450
and you captured that bear.

86
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
Sometimes I even wonder

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
if they guided me to meet you.

88
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
I met the one

89
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,200
whom I'm willing to protect for a lifetime.

90
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,760
Dongji Square is where

91
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,000
we first met.

92
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,920
I also hope Dongji Square

93
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,090
will be a place even more memorable for us.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,159
Will you marry me?

95
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,900
I don't want to.

96
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,960
I do.

97
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,240
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

98
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

99
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,280
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

100
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,500
Are they also helpers you recruited?

101
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,570
I just asked my family for help.

102
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,840
The others are all

103
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,920
here to help me out of respect for you, the treasure of Hezhe.

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,080
They're just lending a hand.

105
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,880
Boss,

106
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,280
how was your brother's

107
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,410
skill at creating a scary atmosphere?

108
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,890
Didn't scare you, did I?

109
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,200
Although my photography skills aren't as good as Sha Tang's,

110
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,530
my tailing skills are pretty good, right?

111
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,840
Hello.

112
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,280
Hello.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,640
I've been squatting here since early morning.

114
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,120
My legs are numb from squatting.

115
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,580
Luckily, I didn't mess up.

116
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
Are you guys ready?

117
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,480
Manyue has already left Dongji Square.

118
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,880
Manyue,

119
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,960
seeing you save someone from a bear

120
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,880
made your father very proud.

121
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Mom! Mom!

122
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,920
Hurry!

123
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,720
Attention, attention!

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,580
Important announcement!

125
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,000
In the direction of Hezhe New Village from our city,

126
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,440
a wild albino bear has been spotted.

127
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,220
You truly are my daughter,

128
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Yueyue.

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
Although I didn't do anything,

130
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,050
I did provide the money.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,240
Will you marry me?

132
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,880
Yes.

133
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,280
yes,

134
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,480
yes,

135
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,080
yes.

136
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,760
If it weren't for that photo you took,

137
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,040
allowing me to see that white bear,

138
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,640
I really suspect it might be Yuelao in disguise,

139
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
just to lead me to you.

140
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,400
You either have an overactive imagination,

141
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,560
or you're experiencing a bout of lovesickness.

142
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,680
I'm serious.

143
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
Otherwise, why can't I ever capture it on camera,

144
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
while you casually photographed it twice?

145
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
Because that's my magic hour.

146
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,920
Magic hour?

147
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Sounds familiar?

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
Teacher Lin,

149
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,320
why did you stop playing?

150
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,120
Look!

151
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,040
That bear!

152
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,570
What is it doing?

153
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,040
It's...

154
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,050
what is it doing?

155
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,000
It's waving at us.

156
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,640
Quick, take a picture!

157
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,400
Take it, take it!

158
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,960
Okay.

159
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,640
With the last photo,

160
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,780
'Tracking the Bear in Snow' was born.

161
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,440
Young photographer Sha Tang's series of works

162
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,720
Children of the Moon

163
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,520
has finally been completed.

164
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,720
The original intention of this series

165
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,400
was to showcase

166
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,520
the survival state of various albino animals in nature,

167
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,800
to raise public awareness about albino individuals

168
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,860
and attention to this special group.

169
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,890
as well as to promote care for them.

170
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm all set and in the car.

171
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,860
So, where are we going?

172
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,680
Guangxi.

173
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
We're driving there?

174
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,560
Isn't that too far?

175
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,080
We'll make stops along the way.

176
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,880
There are many beautiful sights to see on the road.

177
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,640
The most beautiful scenery on the road

178
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,440
is right here.

179
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
is right here.

180
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,400
is right here.

181
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,560
is right here.

182
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,200
Now,

183
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
I've become a famous photographer

184
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,720
who has traveled all over China, Sha Tang.

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
So I want to invite you,

186
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,320
my celebrity wife,

187
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,280
to retrace this journey with me.

188
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Would you do me the honor?

189
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,800
Alright.

190
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,960
Then you'd better be prepared.

191
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,890
This journey will take a long time.

192
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,240
How long?

193
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,140
So long that by the time we get off,

194
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,970
we'll be in our seventies or eighties.

195
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,800
That long?

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,800
Yes.

197
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
By then, you'll be Old Mrs. Lin.

198
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,560
And you'll be Old Grandpa Sha.

199
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,600
Old Sha, Old Mrs. Lin.

200
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
Old Grandpa Sha.

201
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,000
Old Mrs. Lin.

202
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,120
Come on, Old Grandpa Sha, give us a smile.

203
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,440
Let's set off.
