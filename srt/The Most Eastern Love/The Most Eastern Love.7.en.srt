1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,240
Jun Nan.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,760
Feng Xiang.

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,960
Qiang.

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,680
Hang.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,320
Zhen Lin.

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,080
Hao La Si Geng Lin Tong Hui Ying Le Han.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,640
Jun Tong Ming Xin.

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,520
Liang.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,800
This is

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
the new formula for Liangjiang.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,360
What's the current situation at the Liangjiang Distillery?

12
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,000
After they met with Manager Zhao,

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,320
Lin Manyue took Sha Tang

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,800
and stayed in the wine cellar, not coming out.

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,730
They won't let me get close either.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Yueyue suspects you.

17
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,320
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,050
It could also be that I've been getting too close to Sha Tang.

19
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,300
When will Yueyue ever get jealous for me?

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,200
Wait.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,880
You're saying Lin Manyue and Sha Tang went

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,560
into the wine cellar and haven't come out?

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,640
Is that the point?

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,080
That is exactly the point!

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Didn't I tell you to seduce Sha Tang?

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,759
Where's your personal charm?

27
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,560
Their eyes were only on each other.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,290
I really couldn't do anything.

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,000
Sha Tang, that clingy pest.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,450
Go to the winery.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
Make some noise for me.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,560
I must let Yueyue know

33
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,000
who can really make her feel safe.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,250
It's not allowed in principle.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,500
Payment received.

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,920
Alright.

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,760
But you've given far too much.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,840
The final is about to begin.

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,040
That's the taste.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Perfect.

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,220
This is the one.

42
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,240
This is it.

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,500
Let me taste it.

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,760
You just...

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Maybe you shouldn't drink anymore.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,880
What if...

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
What if...

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
What if you drink too much?

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,970
Then I won't drink anymore.

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Just a little bit.

51
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,940
This is the one.

52
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,920
this is the one.

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,780
this is the one.

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,640
Take it.

55
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,200
It's yours.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,400
For me?

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,120
No, no, no. This is too valuable.

58
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
It's a family heirloom. I can't accept it.

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,300
It's meant for you.

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,640
It's fine. I have many more.

61
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,370
Just take it.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,459
There's a saying that goes...

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,560
A thousand cups are too few when drinking with a kindred spirit.

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Such a fine thing should be given to someone

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,100
who appreciates wine.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,480
Alright.

67
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,100
This is the level of our competitors.

68
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,720
I don't want close.

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,850
I want to crush them.

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,520
I've given you the standard answer.

71
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,080
If you can't mix a better taste than Liang Jiang tonight,

72
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,940
get out of here,

73
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,820
all of you go dig potatoes in Siberia.

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,400
Yueyue,

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
you'll soon know

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
who is most worthy of you.

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,490
Go dig potatoes in Siberia.

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
Go with them.

79
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,800
Hey.

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,240
Okay.

81
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Alright, alright, alright.

82
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,880
Please.

83
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,560
What's wrong?

84
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,040
The way you upgrade your beer

85
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,360
is quite unique.

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,440
Is it too sour?

87
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,300
Let me taste it.

88
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,240
Didn't we taste it yesterday?

89
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,120
It wasn't this bad.

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,380
No, someone has tampered with our drink.

91
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,560
Bitters.

92
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Any bartender should know about it.

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
You did this.

94
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,480
It was me.

95
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,740
But where's the evidence?

96
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,080
Why?

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,840
Because... because of me.

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Manager Zhao,

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
forgive my unannounced visit.

100
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
It's because

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,240
I've just upgraded the beer recipe.

102
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,620
I simply couldn't wait

103
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,280
to have you taste

104
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
the most distinctive

105
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,200
and flavorful Qianweina beer from Dongji.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
(Music)

107
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
As expected from Qianweina,

108
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,440
good beer.

109
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,880
Stealing our beer, stealing our recipe,

110
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,120
you shameless thief!

111
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,360
Yueyue.

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
You can eat whatever you want,

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
but you can't say whatever you want.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,760
Natasha took the formula.

115
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,420
What does it have to do with me?

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,280
We've really let the wolf into the house.

117
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,410
You're the one who brought the wolf in.

118
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,640
Manager Zhao,

119
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
you've seen what happened.

120
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,120
They tampered with our beer.

121
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,250
Give me another chance.

122
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
I won't let you down.

123
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,170
You don't have a chance.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,159
Your secret weapon is gone.

125
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,000
All the traditional pine needle extract.

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,250
I've taken them all.

127
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,360
Is there some treasure in the winery?

128
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,280
You never take me to see it.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
It's just an abandoned old wine cellar.

130
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,960
What treasure could there be?

131
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,090
You just don't want to take me to see it.

132
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,880
Your family's treasure.

133
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,680
Wait a moment.

134
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,280
Let's go.

135
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,820
I'll take you to see it.

136
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,680
Treasure hunting isn't as fun as drinking.

137
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Let's drink.

138
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Not necessarily.

139
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,080
Manager Zhao,

140
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,880
it won't take up too much of your time.

141
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,160
Alright, I'll give you one chance.

142
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,960
I hope you won't disappoint me.

143
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,290
You can steal the formula, steal the beer,

144
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
steal the extract,

145
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,280
but you don't know the ratio of the extract.

146
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,360
I believe in such a short time,

147
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,920
you won't be able to find

148
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,180
the most suitable ratio for the extract.

149
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,440
Because this requires

150
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
patience,

151
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
understanding,

152
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,600
trust,

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,500
and more importantly,

154
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
it requires love.

155
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Manager Zhao.

156
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,420
The morning mist on the Ussuri River.

157
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,680
The first ray of sunlight in the birch forest.

158
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,640
What a good wine!

159
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
What's this wine called?

160
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,970
White Painted Bear.

161
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,080
White Painted Bear.

162
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Manager Zhao,

163
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,200
The quality of our Qianweina

164
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
is well-known.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
Our brand effect

166
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,010
is also guaranteed.

167
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,440
Most importantly,

168
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,360
the price I promised

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,240
is only valid if we sign the contract today.

170
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,120
Boss Zhong,

171
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
although I'm a businessman,

172
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,970
and the price you offered is indeed tempting,

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
however,

174
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,400
your way of doing business

175
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,920
I really can't agree with.

176
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,680
So,

177
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,000
this order

178
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm going to give it to Liangjiang Brewery.

179
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
Music

180
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,200
They say it's far, far up in the white clouds.

181
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,080
They say it's near, close to the heart.

182
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,600
They say she's far, in the North and East Poles.

183
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,960
They say she's near, in my homeland.

184
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Whether she's near or far,

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,200
her beauty is undeniable.

186
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,120
The first note of a boat song is the most touching.

187
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,280
The first breeze of morning is the sweetest.

188
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,320
It's not far from here,

189
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,080
just that the evening breeze of Ussuri

190
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,600
is a bit lingering.

191
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,760
It's not far from here,

192
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,240
just that the stories of the birch forest

193
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,440
are a bit entangling.

194
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,680
It's not far from here,

195
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,880
just that the melody of Errenzhuan

196
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,200
has a touch of romance.
