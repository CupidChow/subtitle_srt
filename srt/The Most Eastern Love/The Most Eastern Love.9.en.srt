1
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,600
Jia Hao.

2
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Jia Hao.

3
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,840
Li Jia Hao.

4
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,920
Li Jia Hao.

5
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,000
Jia Hao.

6
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,160
Jia Hao.

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,560
Jia Hao.

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,039
Mom.

9
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,800
I found a dad.

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,860
I've started learning photography.

11
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,690
You've become a father so quickly.

12
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,960
Mom.

13
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,920
What does that devil want to do?

14
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,960
Why won't he leave us alone?

15
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,890
He's back again. What does he want?

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,280
Maybe he still wants to find that white bear.

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
What bear?

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,160
My sister in the mountains

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
captured a white black bear on camera.

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,440
He found out about it.

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,640
He stayed in Fuyuan

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,880
probably because he wants my sister

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,810
to take him to find that white bear.

24
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,260
Finding a bear?

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
He's just a jerk.

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
He's making Yueyue do such dangerous things.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,079
My sister has already agreed to it.

28
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,440
Since he's back,

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
I guess in the next couple of days

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,040
they'll be heading into the mountains.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,480
Shanhai.

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,320
Do you still want to find Natasha?

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,440
Of course.

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,640
You haven't answered me yet.

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,970
Why aren't you leaving?

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,100
I've already sold the studio.

37
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,360
Now I'm free as a bird.

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,890
Then how did you know I was here?

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,120
Let me introduce myself.

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Photographer for the Guangxi Little Brave Travelers Group.

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,400
Sha Tang.

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,440
Why do I feel like you've been planning this for a long time?

43
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,770
This can't be called long-term planning.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,930
I mainly wanted to give you a surprise.

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,400
A surprise?

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,360
Alright then.

47
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,240
What about little Jiahao?

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,640
Why does she call you dad?

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,060
Kids playing house, you know.

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,000
She calls me mom.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,450
Why does she call me mom?

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
Jiahao.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,920
Dad, Mom.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,410
She's calling you, Mom.

55
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,920
Dad, Mom.

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,850
Let's take a family photo with you.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,640
I'm afraid you'll have to work hard these couple of days.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,120
I've worked as a tour guide before,

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,250
but I've never taken care of children.

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Look at the shadows on the ground.

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,690
Don't they look like a family of three?

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,680
You...

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
What will you do when it's over the day after tomorrow?

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,880
Once the children are sent away,

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,040
my work will be finished.

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll take you into the mountains to find bears.

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,200
Really?

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,680
Keep your voice down, the child is asleep.

69
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
Sha Tang has returned,

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,800
giving our story

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,120
a new turn.

72
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
This time,

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,840
I must hold onto his hand,

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
and also actively grasp

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
my own happiness.

76
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
It's cold in the mountains.

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,120
Did you bring all the warm clothes?

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,850
Don't worry.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,960
We won't make the same mistake twice.

80
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,360
You two are so inconsiderate.

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,840
Not inviting me for such an exciting trip.

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,600
Why would we invite you?

83
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,930
A can of beef would be more useful than you.

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
We mainly didn't want to interfere with Boss Lin's money-making.

85
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,280
Cut it out.

86
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm worried you might lure my boss into the mountains.

87
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,840
And sell her off.

88
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,240
I need to protect my boss.

89
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,240
Let's go.

90
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,960
You should be happy to have a free driver.

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,600
Let's go.

92
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,700
You're looking for me.

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,440
You don't answer your phone,

94
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,570
get drunk every day,

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
it's really hard to find you.

96
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,320
Our cooperation has already ended.

97
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
I don't need to report to you every day

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,680
about my whereabouts,

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,400
boss.

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
The past cooperation has ended,

101
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,570
but a new collaboration

102
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,640
has just begun.

103
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,720
For example?

104
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,960
For example, a certain devoted man

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,600
who's been desperately looking for you but can't find you.

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
In his heartbreak, he thought of

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
me, who can do anything.

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
So here you are today.

109
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,200
I didn't expect

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,020
Boss Zhong would be in this kind of business.

111
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
After all, seeing a devoted person heartbroken

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
makes one feel a bit of pity.

113
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,920
You should know,

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,720
trying to get a player to settle down

115
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,800
is harder than getting Tang Monk to enter the sea.

116
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,520
Forget it.

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,520
I have no plans for early retirement.

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
I'm just relaying the message as it is.

119
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,890
Every time he mentions you,

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,280
I can feel

121
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
the passion in his heart.

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,680
Alright,

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,520
I've received your message.

124
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm going back to catch up on some sleep now.

125
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
The Long Time Coming Bar is closed.

126
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,850
Guess where the boss is?

127
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,700
What are you smelling?

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
A milky scent.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,640
Really?

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
You two aren't even trying to hide it anymore, huh?

131
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,760
What's that sound?

132
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,890
Is someone talking?

133
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,730
I don't think so.

134
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,400
Don't scare me, Man Yue.

135
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,260
There's no one.

136
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,800
Man Yue, this is so disgusting.

137
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Oh God, please take me now.

138
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
No way, wait until we get off the car.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Don't drag us into this.

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,560
That's not right.

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,880
It should be after he gets off the car.

142
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,140
Otherwise, wouldn't the car be wrecked?

143
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,880
Sha Tang, how can your warm mouth

144
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,680
say such cold words?

145
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,920
Still better than some people.

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,320
A dog's mouth can't produce ivory.

147
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,240
Look at you all united against a common enemy now.

148
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,680
With your venomous little mouths.

149
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,280
You really are a perfect match.

150
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,080
I get it now.

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,480
It must be our current venomous faces

152
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,200
that remind him of something.

153
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Some unbearable past memories.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,520
Since ancient times, deep love can't be kept.

155
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,559
Only tricks can win hearts.

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
Some people, you know.

157
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
They're hurt inside.

158
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,400
We're trying to find balance here.

159
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,120
Let me educate you a bit.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,050
This is called psychological compensation effect.

161
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Someone's angry.

162
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,000
The car can only go this far.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,520
Let's walk the rest of the way.

164
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,380
I have a feeling

165
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,480
this time, we'll definitely be able to photograph a polar bear.

166
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,810
Should we go through the procedure first?

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,410
What procedure?

168
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,400
Look at you two, so inexperienced.

169
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,720
I'll go first.

170
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
I promise

171
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,960
I won't be a killjoy during this bear-seeking expedition.

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
I won't say 'I wish I hadn't come' at all.

173
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,240
Lin Shanhai.

174
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,200
Wait for me!

175
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,340
You two have no sense of ceremony.

176
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,090
Sha Tang, come and look.

177
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Manyue, look.

178
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,280
That's it.

179
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,640
Yes, yes, yes.

180
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
It went in that direction.

181
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,720
Slow down.

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,280
What are you photographing?

183
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,320
I... I...

184
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,960
I've never seen this before.

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm just keeping a memento.

186
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,000
Keep up.

187
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
Slow down, Sha Tang.

188
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,650
The footprints have disappeared.

189
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,040
I take back what I said at the foot of the mountain.

190
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

191
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,500
Let's hurry and leave.

192
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,320
Let's retreat, get out of here.

193
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,120
What's wrong?

194
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,650
Have you heard this saying?

195
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
Clouds are the tongue of the sky,

196
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,090
Snow is the breath of the earth.

197
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
The snow is starting to blow.

198
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,280
There will be a blizzard soon.

199
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
It's very dangerous.

200
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,960
But if we leave now,

201
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,920
it will be difficult to find it again.

202
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,320
In such extreme weather,

203
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,060
even bears will seek shelter.

204
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
They won't move around much.

205
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,440
Once the new snow covers everything tomorrow,

206
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
when the bear comes out again,

207
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
you'll find its tracks more easily.

208
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
That makes sense.

209
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,980
Where should we go?

210
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,580
Over there.

211
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,880
We shouldn't be far from that Cuoluozi.

212
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,540
If we hurry, we can make it.

213
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,480
You stay here.
