1
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,080
Manyue.

2
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,520
Thank you.

3
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,000
But I'm still curious.

4
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,840
How did you notice something was off with Natasha?

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,140
Fortunately, you were prepared.

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,400
Otherwise, this trip would have been for nothing.

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,600
Natasha's entrance was quite strange.

8
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,080
how could it be such a coincidence

9
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,479
that she fainted near us?

10
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,520
And there's another thing.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
I'm also suspicious.

12
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
I've carefully observed.

13
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,120
Her torch.

14
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,640
Throughout the entire process,

15
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,079
it didn't serve any purpose at all.

16
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,800
So what was the point of her carrying that torch?

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,079
So she used the black smoke from the torch

18
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,340
to provide our location to Zhong Ziqing.

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,970
I think that's the case.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Lin Shanhai.

21
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
What do you think?

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,920
Don't play dead.

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Let's talk about it when we get back.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
It's not safe to talk while driving.

25
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
Is it fun?

26
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Lin Shanhai, I always used to say,

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
'use your brain, use your brain.'

28
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,560
How did you end up with a lovesick brain?

29
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,280
Can't you wake up a bit?

30
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,160
Who are you taking it out on?

31
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
Now you're getting angry at me?

32
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,800
Am I wrong?

33
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't be angry, don't be angry, Manyue.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
The outcome is good, isn't it?

35
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,200
You see,

36
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,329
we found White Bear.

37
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,160
We also know Natasha's true colors.

38
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,480
We should be grateful for Zhong Ziqing's arrangements,

39
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,160
right?

40
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,480
Boss, I'm not human.

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
You can vent your anger however you want.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
But I swear,

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't bring Zhong Ziqing here.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,720
Stop swearing.

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520
I know you didn't bring him here.

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,450
Come, come, sit down, sit down.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,920
Manyue is angry,

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,120
not because of what you said to Zhong Ziqing.

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
You're her brother.

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,600
She just can't stand

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
you being tricked over and over again.

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,320
We can all see

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,400
you're not yourself when you're around her.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,440
You keep wanting to back out and leave the mountain. Besides,

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,480
where did you send that photo of yours?

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
Who can tell where that is?

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,600
from beginning to end,

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,860
there's only one wolf.

59
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,890
What's her name?

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,200
Natasha.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
She owes me an explanation for this.

62
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,960
Sit back down.

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,280
Can't you use your brain and learn from this?

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,340
Stay away from her.

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,200
Are we just going to let this go?

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,000
I.

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,560
The border town playboy.

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,640
The king of picking up girls in Fuyuan.

69
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,900
I've been fooled twice by the same woman.

70
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Where's my pride now?

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,800
Alright, let me ask you.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
How did you meet Natasha?

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
She came to the bar and hit on him first.

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,210
Then I took her away.

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,159
I, I, I...

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,200
Don't talk nonsense.

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,760
Manyue, I didn't know about this.

78
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,560
I didn't know about this, Manyue.

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,320
You didn't know?

80
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,440
You didn't know she was hitting on you?

81
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,680
I was drunk that day. I left right after.

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,480
You were drunk?

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,680
With your alcohol tolerance, how could you get drunk?

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
Can we talk about his situation first?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,520
Let's talk about...

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,560
Your alcohol tolerance, bang, bang, bang.

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,920
One drink, just one drink, just one drink.

88
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Let me ask you.

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,000
When she wasn't contacting you,

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,130
could you reach her?

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
We're all adults here.

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Everyone has their own business to mind.

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,120
Then let me rephrase the question.

94
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
when you two are not together,

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,720
do you know where she is?

96
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
Do you know what she's doing?

97
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
She... she...

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,780
She's a bartender.

99
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,240
She also works part-time as a model.

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,120
So when we're not in contact,

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,640
she's probably working.

102
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,320
Oh no.

103
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
On standby 24/7.

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
Don't talk nonsense.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
She's actually the clingy one.

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,520
Alright, let me ask you one last question.

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,850
How much do you know about Natasha's past?

108
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,450
Don't you get it yet?

109
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
My dear,

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,290
you're being played like a dog.

111
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Woof, woof.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,560
Woof woof woof woof.

113
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,400
Come on, tell me about your situation.

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,800
I really drank too much.

115
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,860
You drank too much.

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
You didn't drink too much.

117
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
I wasn't paying attention. I just turned and left.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,120
Wasn't paying attention.

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,280
Yeah, I wasn't paying attention.

120
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,159
You're too careless.

121
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,920
I was discussing important matters that day.

122
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,080
What important matters were you discussing?

123
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,120
Discussing matters related to you.

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,200
Related to me?

125
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
That's right.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
It's related to me, yet you're flirting with someone else?

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
That's between the two of us.

128
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,440
These kids are out looking for bears.

129
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
where have they gone to search?

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,240
Indeed, it's already so late.

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,820
It's really worrying.

132
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,200
Dad,

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,160
they're back.

134
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,140
Uncle, Auntie.

135
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,820
Oh my, how did you get so drunk?

136
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,600
We drank it straight.

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,160
Come on, take it easy.

138
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,560
Go make him a cup of honey water.

139
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,520
Slow down.

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,640
Easy, easy.

141
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,360
Manyue, you've worked hard these past few days.

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,490
Get some rest early. I'll be going now.

143
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't you

144
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,680
want to join me

145
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,480
What?

146
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,880
to see the albino bear we photographed?

147
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,960
Of course I do.

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,280
Let's see it.

149
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120
Let's see.

150
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,620
The exciting moment has arrived.

151
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,730
What does this mean?

152
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,640
It's nothing.

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,680
Why?

154
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
It's useless. Don't bother trying.

155
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
What's wrong?

156
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,460
The storage device is broken.

157
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,600
Then...

158
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,570
All the photos are gone?

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,240
Yes.

160
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
It's okay.

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,520
It's alright.

162
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,810
The most important scenery

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,799
is always in the next adventure.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
Next time,

165
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,900
I'll definitely accompany you to find the bear.

166
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,039
It's fine.

167
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,920
Although we didn't capture the planned polar bear on camera,

168
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,960
I encountered in my life

169
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,810
another polar bear.

170
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,640
Lin Manyue.

171
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
How can you still doubt her at a time like this?

172
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,330
you saw how she was just now.

173
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,880
Who would risk their life just to deceive someone?

174
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
I know you don't like her.

175
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
but at least wait until she's better before sending her down the mountain.

176
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
Why are you saying all this now?

177
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,560
Natasha, why are you out here?

178
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,280
You need to rest now.

179
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,360
Natasha, it's too dangerous here.

180
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
Let me take you back to the city.

181
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,720
They're both professionals.

182
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,980
They don't need both of us here right now.

183
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Natasha, you liar.

184
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,400
Is money really that important?

185
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,000
You'd do anything for money?

186
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,770
Would you betray anyone for it?

187
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,400
We've truly let the wolf into the house.

188
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,560
You're the one who brought the wolf in.

189
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,920
Why?

190
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,380
People die for wealth,

191
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,180
birds perish for food.

192
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
About the winery...

194
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
It's all my fault.

195
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,120
Can you forgive me?

196
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
My sea, do you know?

197
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
I am Russian.

198
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,160
I am from a fighting nation.

199
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,920
I would never let my loved one

200
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,800
and their family be in danger.

201
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
Don't worry.

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,800
I will definitely protect you and your sister.

203
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Stop right there.

204
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,780
Going to find Natasha again, huh?

205
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
Stop looking.

206
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,120
Manyue has gone to deal with the brewery business.

207
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,440
She sent me to keep an eye on you at home.

208
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,560
Sha Tang, no matter what,

209
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm still your brother-in-law.

210
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,600
If you want to enter the Lin family in the future,

211
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
you'll need my approval too.

212
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,440
But why do I feel

213
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,840
that you don't have much say in the Lin family?

214
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,500
I can tell who's the boss between you and Manyue.

215
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,980
Just one last meeting.

216
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,920
Otherwise, I can't let it go.

217
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,280
You must go?

218
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Alright, I'll help you.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,720
But

220
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,640
but

221
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,840
there are two conditions.

222
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,440
Go ahead.

223
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,120
First,

224
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,560
Manyue must not know about this.

225
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,120
No problem.

226
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,080
And second?

227
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,560
I'm not letting you go alone.

228
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm going with you.

229
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,160
As long as we can find Natasha,

230
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,360
these are not issues.

231
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,720
I didn't expect you,

232
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,440
usually as quiet as a clam,

233
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,600
not saying much,

234
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,160
to be so considerate at crucial moments.

235
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,920
It's all because of you.

236
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,600
You encouraged me to bravely love Manyue back then.

237
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,460
Let's go. We have a long way ahead.

238
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,200
Let me summarize for you.

239
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
The root cause

240
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,360
is when you face Natasha.

241
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,320
From a player to a simp.

242
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,120
That sounds awful.

243
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,760
Then from a love guru to a pure love warrior.

244
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,240
You're being sarcastic.

245
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,580
I think being a pure love warrior is pretty good.

246
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,440
Let's get back to the point.

247
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Why do they say simps end up with nothing in the end?

248
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
Because of an imbalance in the relationship.

249
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,360
Humans naturally lose interest

250
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,680
in things that are too easily obtainable.

251
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,960
In mate selection, people prefer

252
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,600
partners who can stimulate their desire to conquer.

253
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I can't believe you're saying this.

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,130
This is what AI said.

255
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on, tell me now,

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,880
what do you want to do with Natasha?

257
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Or rather,

258
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,600
what kind of relationship

259
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
do you want to develop with Natasha?

260
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,680
I just want her to feel

261
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,840
what it's like to be deceived.

262
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,300
Then you need to pull yourself together now.

263
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,720
Get back to your former self.

264
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,200
You need to use her competitive nature.

265
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,280
Make her jealous.

266
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Make her envious.

267
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,120
Make her feel as insecure as you are now.

268
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,760
Make her-

269
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I understand the logic.

270
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,480
But the problem now is how to find Natasha.

271
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,940
You don't need to find her.

272
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,680
She will come to you herself.

273
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,540
How do you know?

274
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,160
The AI said so.

275
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,900
The AI really got it right.

276
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,450
Don't look back.

277
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,080
My sea.

278
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,640
Get lost.

279
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
You're angry.

280
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,000
Can I have a drink here before I leave?

281
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,090
Go drink over there.

282
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
What's the next step?

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,080
Level up.
