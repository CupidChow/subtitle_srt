1
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,840
Barbara.

2
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,539
Will you ever stop?

3
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,200
After I left last night,

4
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,420
what did you two do?

5
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,810
I'm not telling you.

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,840
You guys,

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,700
that's enough.

8
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,200
Hey, I did you such a big favor,

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,860
and this is all you treat me to?

10
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,759
That's not the point.

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,050
On this day, twenty-six years ago,

12
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,479
a great lady was born.

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,600
Your ex-girlfriend?

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,060
Your current girlfriend.

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,050
It's Man Yue's birthday today.

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,720
This is the first birthday

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,380
we're celebrating together.

18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,820
I'll prepare a candlelit dinner for her.

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,610
Isn't that a bit boring?

20
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,410
I'll take her to see a movie.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,700
That's a bit childish.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,199
How about I buy her a bouquet of flowers?

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,850
That's a bit cliché.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
Then what should I do?

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,490
Forget it, figure it out yourself.

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,300
What does Man Yue like anyway?

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,240
Happy birthday, Yueyue.

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,540
Little Bear and I are waiting for you.

29
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,210
Please, have a seat.

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,560
Well...

31
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
Time was short.

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,120
I found out late as well.

33
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm not very familiar with Fuyuan either.

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,520
So I chose this place.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
I hope you like it.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
It doesn't matter where we are.

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,300
As long as you're here.

38
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Alright.

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,220
Let's take a look at the gift then.

40
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,540
Why don't you guess what's inside first?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Based on my limited knowledge of you,

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
it wouldn't happen to be something fluffy, would it?

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
You're half right.

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,500
A polar bear plush toy,

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,820
polar bear gloves,

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
a polar bear hat,

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,220
and what I think is the cutest and prettiest,

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,280
a polar bear water bottle.

49
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
So, do you like them?

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,200
You really love this polar bear, don't you?

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,720
Of course.

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,579
It's part of my albinism project.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,880
Today is my birthday.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,720
Is this polar bear all you can see?

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,180
Is your albinism project all you care about?

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
You don't like it?

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,040
It's not that I don't like it.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,520
Manyue,

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,850
it's mainly because we haven't known each other for long. I-

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
It's okay, it's okay.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
You're right, indeed.

62
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,880
we haven't known each other for long.

63
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,560
we don't know each other very well.

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,880
Th-that's not the point.

65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,280
Why don't you tell me what you like?

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,360
I'll get it for you right now.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
Who asks what someone likes on their birthday?

68
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,080
and then gets it for them.

69
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,400
What were you doing earlier?

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
If I had asked you in advance, it wouldn't have been a surprise, would it?

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
You could have asked Lin Shanhai.

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,400
I'll ask.

73
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Blow out the candles, blow out the candles.

74
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
blow out the candles.

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,740
Come on, quick, quick, quick.

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,130
Is he celebrating the polar bear's birthday?

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,840
Manyue, I'm lighting the candles now.

78
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,880
Can we stop giving pink things in the future?

79
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,640
Boss, come over. We have a long way to go.

80
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,800
Okay.

81
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,480
Just as the pear blossoms cover the horizon,

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,400
soft veils float on the river,

83
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,880
Katyusha stands on the steep bank,

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,520
her song is like the bright spring sunshine.

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,720
Natasha stands on the steep bank,

86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,680
her song is like the bright spring sunshine.

87
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,280
Zhong Ziqing, you bastard.

88
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,480
That's quite an unusual way to greet someone.

89
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
It's all because of you.

90
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,800
My Sea is angry with me.

91
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
It's all because of you that my Sea is ignoring me.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,400
You're the one who caused this.

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
It's all your fault.

94
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,960
It's all...

95
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
Who's to blame for all this?

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,480
Who are you trying to blame here?

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,540
Only incompetent people resort to shouting, you know?

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
You're yelling at the wrong person.

99
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,220
I've got the wrong person.

100
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,880
Weren't you the one who made me do those things?

101
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,159
Wasn't it you who made me...

102
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,159
hurt my Sea over and over again?

103
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,960
Sister,

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,159
you took my money.

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,280
So having money makes you great?

106
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
You think money lets you do whatever you want, huh?

107
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,480
Fine, I'll give back all the money I got from you.

108
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
I'll return it all to you.

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,080
Take your money back.

110
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,480
Take your money back, I don't want it anymore.

111
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,840
Take your money away.

112
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Take it all.

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,280
Take your money.

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
take your money.

115
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,000
take your money.

116
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,480
I'm willing to...

117
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,280
give all my money...

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
for my Sea to forgive me.

119
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
Now I...

120
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,280
now I only want my Sea.

121
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,600
Alright,

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,330
alright, alright, sister.

123
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,040
If you want to cry, go home and do it.

124
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,970
Go find your Sea.

125
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,400
Guards, escort them out.

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Are you crazy?

127
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,799
I'm sorry. I know you don't want to see me.

128
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,460
But I still wanted to apologize to you in person.

129
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,600
I didn't intend to hold it against you either.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
But can you please leave my brother alone?

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,039
He's no match for you.

132
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,520
I admit, for the sake of money,

133
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,640
I took advantage of Shanhai's feelings for me.

134
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,320
I did many things that hurt him and you,

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,380
and were detrimental to Shatang.

136
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,240
I deeply regret it now.

137
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,000
I've realized that no matter how much money I get,

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
it won't make me happy.

139
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
Instead, I feel more heartache.

140
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,320
As things happened one after another,

141
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,960
the distance between Shanhai and me

142
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
grew further and further apart.

143
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,850
When I close my eyes,

144
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
all I see in my mind

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,320
are the happy moments

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,080
I spent with Shanhai recently,

147
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,600
and how he desperately tried to save me

148
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,960
and protect me in the mountains,

149
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,560
and how he argued with you all for my sake.

150
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,880
You should be telling him these things.

151
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,140
Why are you telling me?

152
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,440
But he doesn't trust me anymore now.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,330
He won't even talk to me.

154
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,600
I just want you to tell him

155
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,280
that he's the most special man I've ever met.

156
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,880
I don't want him to continue

157
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,640
suffering because of me.

158
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,720
Also,

159
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,180
the money I got from Zhong Ziqing,

160
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
I've already returned it all to him.

161
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,410
I'm really preparing to leave.

162
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,080
Wait a moment.

163
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,640
These two speeches of yours are too long for me to remember.

164
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,520
You should go and tell him yourself in person.

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
But Shanhai, he...

166
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,160
Get in the car.

167
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,960
You must be the photographer, Sha Tang.

168
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,680
Hello.

169
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,000
You are...

170
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,210
Lin Manyue, the treasure of the Hezhe people.

171
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,200
Maybe.

172
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,970
I don't really know much about her.

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,760
Here, boss.

174
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm here.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
We've come to see you.

176
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
Mainly her.

177
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,600
Turning herself in, huh?

178
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,400
I have no objection.

179
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,080
Whether it's theft or robbery,

180
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,120
it's enough to get her sentenced for several years.

181
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,650
Let me know if you need to testify against her.

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,520
Stop playing.

183
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,680
Let's talk properly.

184
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,080
Put the instrument down.

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,440
Natasha,

186
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,120
I've taken all the revenge I needed to.

187
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,520
All the anger I had to vent,

188
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,400
I've vented it.

189
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
If you want to drink, help yourself.

190
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,200
It's on me.

191
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,640
But in the future, this kind of thing,

192
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,960
don't bother my sister with it anymore.

193
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,280
Can't you just leave me alone?

194
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,840
I don't know what you're thinking.

195
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,480
I also know what she's thinking.

196
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,360
if she doesn't bother me, you have to.

197
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
if you don't bother me, she still has to.

198
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Rather than having both of you bother me,

199
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
I might as well bring her to bother you first.

200
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
Can I trouble you for a moment now?

201
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,420
Alright, alright.

202
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,960
Go ahead, bother him.

203
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Tell me, how do you want to bother me?

204
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,480
I sincerely want you to forgive me.

205
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,330
Why should I?

206
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Is it because you made drinks for us?

207
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,960
Or because you helped me find White Bear?

208
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,880
Or because you've been through ups and downs with me?

209
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,740
There must be some reason, right?

210
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,810
Tell me, what is it based on?

211
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,370
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

212
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,980
Bet on what?

213
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,240
Bet on this.

214
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,000
If I can win one round,

215
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,960
you have to agree to any condition I set.

216
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,600
Do you dare?

217
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,800
Do you dare or not?

218
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,130
Will you take the bet or not?

219
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
I dare.

220
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,640
Alright, if I lose,

221
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,660
I'll pack my things and leave Fuyuan.

222
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll disappear from your life forever.

223
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,480
It's a deal.

224
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
Manyue, about yesterday...

225
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
Manyue, yesterday...

226
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,280
Manyue,

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,720
What are you doing with that lunchbox?

228
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm going to see Natasha.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,760
What for?

230
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,220
To practice together.

231
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,240
Practice together?
