1
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,860
So you're the one looking for Polar Bear.

2
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,800
I didn't know you were the First Ray of Sunshine.

3
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,400
It's okay.

4
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,020
I'm big enough to let bygones be bygones.

5
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,860
I can help you find Polar Bear.

6
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,960
Really?

7
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,800
Really.

8
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,240
However,

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,400
you need to show some sincerity.

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
In our Northeast,

11
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,610
when you ask for a favor, you need to have the right attitude.

12
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,580
How's it going, my Guangxi homie?

13
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,210
You up for it?

14
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,960
Thank you.

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,090
You're welcome.

16
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,450
Is this okay now?

17
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,290
Alright.

18
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,200
Okay.

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
When, when are we leaving?

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,079
Let's go!

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
Right.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,960
let's go, let's go!

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,840
Come on, young man!

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,320
Brave bear-seeking boy,

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,200
Come on!

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,560
Let me see your determination to find the bear.

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,320
Run, run!

28
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,840
Lin Manyue,

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
Are you a devil?

30
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Hurry up, hurry up!

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Faster!

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,240
Even faster!

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,920
Come on, run!

34
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,720
Move it, go!

35
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,410
What do you mean?

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,280
Didn't you ask me to take you to find the polar bear?

37
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,440
Are you kidding me?

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,160
I want a live one, one that moves.

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
I see.

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,040
But in our Fuyuan,

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,200
this is the most famous polar bear.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,329
You see, I wasn't clear enough.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Alright, let's call it a day.

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,160
Wait a minute.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
What do you mean 'call it a day'?

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,160
Is this, is this it?

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,880
What else?

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,040
You lied to me again.

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,160
No.

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,480
You never intended to,

51
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
help me find a polar bear, did you?

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,250
Correct.

53
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,400
Making me lose face twice in one day.

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,960
You're even more capable than Zhong Ziqing.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,890
Sha Tang, right?

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,560
This is the price for provoking me.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,240
That photo,

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,680
I've already deleted it from the platform.

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
You're being too petty, aren't you?

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm petty?

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
You want to find a polar bear, right?

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,260
Keep dreaming.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Someone as untrustworthy as you...

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,200
What?

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,320
Great photographer Sha,

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,880
Thanks.

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,140
Help me.

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,200
You're making it so easy for me to find you.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,960
help me just this once.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,680
I'll take you to find the polar bear.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,810
I don't believe you.

73
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,680
I swear.

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you.

75
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,920
Thank you.

76
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
No wonder my proposal was

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
filmed so romantically.

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,360
So you really have a life after all.

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,920
Miss,

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
I'd like to borrow your Teacher Sha

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,260
for two minutes

82
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,040
to express my gratitude.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I don't think that's a good idea.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,659
She has a bad temper

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
and is petty.

86
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
She's afraid of the cold.

87
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,240
I understand, I understand.

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,800
Although the proposal wasn't successful yet,

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,680
I'm very satisfied with the effect.

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
Now everyone in the city knows

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,170
my feelings for Yueyue.

92
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,450
Teacher Sha,

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,840
your contribution is indispensable.

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,680
I know why you feel embarrassed now.

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,340
Shut up. To show my gratitude,

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
and to strike while the iron is hot,

97
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
I want to hire you

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,480
as my proposal candid photographer.

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Alright, let's go to work tomorrow.

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,340
Reject him.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,840
Great, name your price.

102
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,500
Reject him.

103
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,840
Forget it.

104
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,440
I'm not short of this business deal either.

105
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,920
My love story with Yueyue.

106
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,240
We need a chronicler like you.

107
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,880
Hurry, let's go.

108
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,480
We're leaving, we're leaving, we're leaving.

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,530
Teacher Sha,

110
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,659
what are you doing?

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,440
Teacher Sha, please reconsider.

112
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,120
The love story between Yueyue and me

113
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,480
just needs a chronicler like you.

114
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,159
Teacher Sha,

115
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,000
please consider it.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,720
Teacher Sha, name your price.

117
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,650
Teacher Sha,

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,530
This is so annoying.

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,360
Yueyue,

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,120
you

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,159
a performative personality, a greasy tycoon.

122
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,560
you're

123
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,360
a sadistic tormentor.

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,360
May you two be happily married for a hundred years.

125
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,720
I don't want to see either of you again.

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,480
Sha Tang, you

127
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,280
I.

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,000
Boss, I'm done playing.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,860
I'm going home.

130
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,320
Yueyue,

131
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
Someone like you will never find the white bear.

132
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,480
Goodbye.

133
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,240
Goodbye, goodbye.

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,700
Yueyue,

135
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,480
Yueyue,

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,730
Name your price.

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,730
Name your price.

138
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm the one who loves you the most.

139
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840
How could I bear to see you sad?

140
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,240
Yueyue, you're surrounded by me.

141
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,320
Please surrender quickly.

142
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,960
Accept my proposal.

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,120
So annoying, so annoying, so annoying!

144
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,760
Can't people sleep in the early morning?

145
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,400
Yeah.

146
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,920
All this wailing and howling so early in the morning.

147
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,280
It started at five in the morning.

148
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,720
No, this has been going on all morning.

149
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
I can't even go to the bathroom.

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,800
I can't even relieve myself, you know.

151
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Boss, boss, boss!

152
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,040
Daughter, daughter, daughter!

153
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,600
He's blocking the doorway.

154
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,560
I can't get out either.

155
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,640
The brewery is waiting for me.

156
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,800
I need to take charge of the situation.

157
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,480
Daughter,

158
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,120
Is this courtship or a manhunt?

159
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,440
He's even blocking the front door now.

160
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
Brother, I really can't take it anymore.

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,760
Either punch him,

162
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,840
or just give in to him.

163
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
If not, I'll do it.

164
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,760
You go ahead.

165
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
I don't know what to do either.

166
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,200
Let me write some more for you.

167
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,840
I'll go.

168
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,480
I have an idea, I have an idea, I have an idea.

169
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,840
Let's just say we have an idea.

170
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,080
I have an idea, I have an idea.

171
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,880
I have an idea, I have an idea.

172
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,360
Thoughts linger forever.

173
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,560
Sister, please don't do anything rash.

174
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,260
Sister, it's not worth it.

175
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,940
Don't jump.

176
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,010
It's not worth it for some fool.

177
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,600
Yueyue.

178
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,120
Sister.

179
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,600
Yueyue.

180
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,220
Sister.

181
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,920
Yueyue.

182
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,880
Yueyue.

183
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Yueyue.

184
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,560
Yueyue.

185
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,480
Yueyue.

186
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,600
Yueyue.

187
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,640
Yueyue, I can't live without you.

188
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,200
Yueyue.

189
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,920
Boss.

190
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,880
Drive slowly.

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Be careful.

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,100
The only thing that can bring me a moment of peace

193
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,760
is the jaw harp

194
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,250
and that polar bear.

195
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,480
I have a feeling

196
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,690
that the polar bear and I

197
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,960
will meet again.

198
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
We can see polar bears in Dongji.

199
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,760
The polar bear

200
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,370
has really appeared again.

201
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,880
Lin Manyue.

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,120
You.

203
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,330
Why are you here?

204
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,020
Why can't I be here?

205
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,520
You're here to help me find the bear.

206
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
Dream on.

207
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,650
We still have a score to settle.

208
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,480
I've already apologized to you.

209
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
I've deleted the photos too.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
The trouble you put me through yesterday,

211
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,560
I didn't hold it against you either.

212
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,020
Just help me out, will you?

213
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,480
If you could make all those

214
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
who saw the photos forget about them,

215
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
then we'd be even.

216
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,320
Then I...

217
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,100
Lin Manyue,

218
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,140
Lin Manyue,

219
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,820
let's just say I was wrong.

220
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,220
Just say...

221
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,170
Not just say,

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,160
I was wrong.

223
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,960
You were wrong to begin with.

224
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,820
Lin Manyue,

225
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,080
just help me this once, please?

226
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,040
Stop following me.

227
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,080
If you help me this once,

228
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
after I find the bear,

229
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
you can do whatever you want with me.

230
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,360
Don't even think about it. Stop following me.
