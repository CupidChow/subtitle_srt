1
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,760
It's been quite a while since I've been here.

2
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,800
Reminiscing about the past, both bitter and sweet.

3
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,360
Yes.

4
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,490
You're usually at the bar at this time.

5
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,370
What do you know?

6
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,820
You seem quite familiar with this place.

7
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,580
I stayed here for a night with Manyue before.

8
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,039
You two, here?

9
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
One night?

10
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,680
Get your mind out of the gutter.

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
You think everyone's like you?

12
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,640
Player.

13
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,440
I'm just...

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,650
I'm just looking out for my sister.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,050
I had an accident while hiking before.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
Manyue saved me.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,060
This is for you.

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,570
What's this?

19
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,320
What are you laughing at?

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Childish.

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
What do you think?

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,810
If you don't like it, I can exchange it.

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,130
There's a black bag over there.

24
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,400
The weather is too cold.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Cameras can easily get damaged in the cold.

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
To make sure your trip wasn't in vain,

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,760
I made a down jacket

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
for your camera.

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,840
It looks a bit old-fashioned, doesn't it?

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Don't you know this is a classic style?

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,360
Never mind, forget it.

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,000
I want it.

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,480
This way it won't look old-fashioned anymore.

34
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm still here, you know.

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,490
Aren't you two disgusting?

36
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,960
You don't have to be here.

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,400
The snow has stopped.

38
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,120
You two,

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,040
keep being lovey-dovey.

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,980
He can't stand it anymore.

41
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Wake up.

42
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
Natasha.

43
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,400
How is it going?

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
Has Natasha woken up?

45
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,920
Lin Manyue.

46
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,519
Lin Manyue.

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
Saving people is fine,

48
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,200
but I need to give you a heads up.

49
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,760
Natasha works for Zhong Ziqing.

50
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,920
Haven't you learned your lesson from the winery incident?

51
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
In the middle of nowhere, not a soul around,

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
and she suddenly appears near us.

53
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,320
Aren't you suspicious?

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,480
I know, I know.

55
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,080
We can just let her go after she wakes up.

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,159
Natasha is awake.

57
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
Natasha.

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Natasha.

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,480
Natasha, you're finally awake.

60
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Shanhai, I've finally found you.

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
You came to find me?

62
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,780
Yes, I was worried you might be in danger.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,280
So I came to protect you.

64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,490
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,400
Natasha.

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
How did you know we were here?

67
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,000
Mr. Zhong told me.

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,920
How does he know we're here?

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,200
Well...

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Zhong Ziqing is the richest man in Dongji after all.

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,040
It's not hard for him to send someone to inquire about my sister's whereabouts.

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
It's not difficult.

73
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,560
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
The winery incident was entirely my fault.

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,680
Can you forgive me?

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,800
I know.

77
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,680
It must have been Zhong Ziqing who forced you, right?

78
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,320
Yes.

79
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,360
Lin Shanhai, have you lost your mind?

80
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
You can't believe a single word she says.

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
If you don't believe me,

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
I'll leave right now.

83
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
No, no, no.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,240
Lin Manyue,

85
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,120
at a time like this,

86
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,400
you're still doubting her?

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,130
You saw her condition just now.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,800
Who would risk their life just to deceive someone?

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
I know you don't like her,

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,040
but at least wait until she's better before sending her down the mountain.

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,320
Why are you saying all this now?

92
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,250
You've gone mad.

93
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
You're hopeless.

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,720
Natasha, don't worry.

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,960
If there's anything, just tell me.

96
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
I'll help you sort it out.

97
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,960
My Hai, I'm sorry.

98
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,159
I was really afraid you'd be angry.

99
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,800
That's why I hid.

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,920
But I've been thinking about you every moment.

101
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,320
When I close my eyes,

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,360
all I can think about is you.

103
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,740
I'm just glad you're okay.

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,810
Aren't you cold?

106
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,640
move a bit.

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,160
Over here.

108
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,890
Do you know how to dance?

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,860
I'll teach you.

110
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,800
Come on.

111
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,080
When I say forward, you go forward.

112
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
When I say backward, you go backward.

113
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,000
Backward.

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,800
backward.

115
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,040
backward.

116
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Spread your legs.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,130
Close your legs.

118
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,280
Are you still cold?

119
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,010
Not anymore.

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,140
Look at the ground.

121
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,240
At this moment,

122
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,880
time

123
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,560
seems to have been paused.

124
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,840
It's just him and me.

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,640
It's as beautiful as a dream.

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,760
If possible,

127
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I really want to stay in this beautiful dream forever.

128
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
And wake up later.

129
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,880
Wait a moment.

130
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,680
What's wrong?

131
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,400
The hat.

132
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
Boss, boss, boss!

133
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,919
What is it?

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,600
Isn't this too early?

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,159
I bet even the bears aren't up yet.

136
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,679
If you don't want to go, just say so.

137
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,440
Go back and keep your darling company.

138
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,960
That's not what I meant.

139
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
What I mean is,

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
Natasha has just started to recover a bit.

141
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
Why don't we leave a bit later?

142
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,720
My sea.

143
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Why didn't you call me when you left?

144
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Have you not forgiven me yet?

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Natasha, why are you out here?

146
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,320
You need to rest well now.

147
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,760
My Hai,

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,840
so you were worried about me.

149
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
I misunderstood you.

150
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Natasha, it's too dangerous here.

151
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,520
Let me take you back to the city.

152
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,720
They are both professionals.

153
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
They don't need us here for now.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,280
My Hai, I know you're worried about me,

155
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,960
but that's your sister.

156
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,120
She's my sister too.

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,600
We can't just abandon her.

158
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,280
Absolutely not.

159
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
My Hai, you know what?

160
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm Russian.

161
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,520
I come from a warrior nation.

162
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,240
So,

163
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,560
I absolutely cannot

164
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
let my loved one and his family

165
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
fall into danger.

166
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,480
Don't worry.

167
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,200
I will protect you and your family.

168
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,400
Natasha,

169
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,600
you move me so much.

170
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,200
Take a look.

171
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,760
It's beautiful.

172
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
Come here for a moment.

173
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,760
Boss,

174
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
boss.

175
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
In the west,

176
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,120
we found traces of wild animal fighting.

177
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,000
This is animal fur found at the scene.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,560
There's fresh blood on it.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Very good.

180
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,880
It seems heaven is on my side.

181
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,040
This looks like polar bear fur at first glance.

182
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,600
Yes.

183
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,720
Take two people to search the area.

184
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,040
If you find anything,

185
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,600
remember to take good photos.

186
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Alright.

187
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,320
Bear fur.

188
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,600
Let's go.

189
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
Over there.

190
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
