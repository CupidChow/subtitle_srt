1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,240
Jun Nan.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,760
Feng Xiang.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:19,940
Fan.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,120
Qiang.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,640
Hang.

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,280
Zhen Lin.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,000
Las Geng Lin Tong Hui Ying Le Han.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,640
Jun Tong Ming Xin.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Liang.

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,360
Liang.

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,760
Sha Tang.

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Sha Tang.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,960
Sha Tang.

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,640
Sha Tang.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,920
Sha Tang.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Sha Tang.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,840
Sha Tang.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Sha Tang.

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
Sha Tang.

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,360
Sha Tang.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,160
Sha Tang.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,000
Sha Tang.

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,160
I never thought

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,280
I

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,960
Lin Manyue

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,600
would be connected to this man in front of me

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
because of a polar bear.

28
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,039
Where should I begin this story?

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,450
How about starting from

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,920
that misunderstanding?

31
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,180
Yueyue.

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,970
Zhong Ziqing, aren't you cold?

33
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,180
When I think of you,

34
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,120
my heart is filled with warmth and joy.

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,620
Can you please talk normally?

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,340
Please, can you just let it go?

37
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,080
Yueyue.

38
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,040
I've seriously reflected on this.

39
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,920
Every proposal was in the spotlight,

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,560
I didn't consider your feelings.

41
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,000
This time, I deliberately chose a place

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
where it's quiet and private.

43
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,680
Zhong Ziqing, I've said it ten thousand times,

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,360
today,

45
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,880
I'll say it for the ten thousand and first time:

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,440
We're not possible.

47
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,640
Yueyue.

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Yueyue, Yueyue, Yueyue.

49
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,920
Zhong Ziqing.

50
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
Get up, get up, get up.

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
Get up, get up, get up.

52
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,159
Marry me.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,040
What?

54
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,440
Yueyue.

55
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,700
Yueyue.

56
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
This is my first time

57
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
seeing his back.

58
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,159
Idealist.

59
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,640
She's the most talented singer and dancer in our Hezhe tribe.

60
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,200
Isn't that Zhong Ziqing, the richest man in Dongji?

61
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,120
Have you heard?

62
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,480
This girl is no small figure either. She's Lin Manyue, the treasure of the Hezhe people.

63
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,400
Zhong Ziqing, the richest man in Dongji, is getting married.

64
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,060
I've heard.

65
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,560
Bonus for the photographer! This could be a wallpaper!

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,520
Although they were very low-key,

67
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,400
The strongest couple in Dongji has emerged! It's bound to trend!

68
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
he proposed in the snowy wilderness on purpose.

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
It was captured by a photographer from Guangxi named Sha Tang.

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,640
But it was still captured by a wildlife photographer from Guangxi.

71
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,840
But it was still captured by someone from Guangxi,

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,840
what's his name again? Oh right, Sha Tang!

73
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,960
a wildlife photographer captured it.

74
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
Isn't that Zhong Ziqing, the richest man in Dongji?

75
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,640
What's his name again?

76
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,360
Yes, yes, yes.

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,960
His name is Sha Tang.

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,960
So sweet!

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,520
So the proposal scenes in novels really do exist! How romantic!

80
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,480
The photo has received over ten thousand likes online.

81
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Zhong Ziqing, the richest man in Dongji, successfully proposed!

82
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,080
It's big news here in Dongji.

83
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,880
I've heard! Although it was very low-key, deliberately in the wilderness.

84
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,960
Of course.

85
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,440
Just look at who the girl being proposed to is.

86
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,560
She's from our Hezhe tribe,

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,290
Lin Manyue, the most talented singer and dancer.

88
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,210
The photo is beautiful.

89
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,840
Thank you.

90
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,800
It was just a casual shot. No need to thank me.

91
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,520
Friends come from afar,

92
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,520
and bring such generous gifts.

93
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,480
If I don't express my gratitude,

94
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,360
it would be poor hospitality on behalf of us Hezhe people.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Alright then.

96
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,320
Actually, I have something I'd like to ask you about as well.

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,180
Do you have time

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
to talk in person?

99
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,800
Sure.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay, let's meet at Dongji Square.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
See you at Dongji Square.

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
Okay, see you at Dongji Square.

103
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,360
See you soon.

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,040
Wow, it really is him!

105
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,680
You must be the photographer Sha Tang, right?

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
You are

107
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,960
Lin Manyue, the treasure of He Zhe.

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
How much did Zhong Ziqing pay you?

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,880
Who?

110
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,900
Don't pretend.

111
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,880
Who would be secretly taking photos in that remote wilderness for no reason?

112
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
at that time, I

113
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,320
was photographing wildlife.

114
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,800
I happened to see

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
several people stopping you.

116
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,820
I thought it was a robbery.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,720
so I took my camera,

118
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,080
thinking of keeping evidence.

119
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
but when I looked through the viewfinder,

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,040
I discovered he was proposing to you.

121
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
so I captured that happy moment

122
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,000
on camera.

123
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,800
I have two more photos here

124
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,330
that I think are quite good.

125
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,000
Consider it a beautiful blessing for you both.

126
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,280
Thank you so much.

127
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,520
Is there anything else?

128
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,159
Yes, yes.

129
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
They're all in the camera.

130
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,360
If you want, I can copy them for you.

131
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,400
Can I take a look first?

132
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Of course, come here.

133
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
You secretly took photos of me and posted them online.

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Did you get my permission?

135
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,640
I wasn't taking photos secretly.

136
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,680
I just explained.

137
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,800
It's all a misunderstanding.

138
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,460
It's fine. No need to explain.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
This is your punishment.

140
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,010
What do you mean?

141
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,120
No.

142
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,880
You don't like my photos?

143
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
I can delete them.

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,320
You think I uploaded your photos without permission.

145
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,760
I can apologize to you for that.

146
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,160
What gives you the right to format my memory card?

147
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
You deleted all the animal photos I took.

148
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,600
Since you're an animal photographer,

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
point your camera at animals,

150
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
don't go around taking random photos and causing trouble for others.

151
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,760
You,

152
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,800
you brought your phone, right?

153
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,360
What are you doing?

154
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,000
Delete the photos from the internet.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
I won't delete them.

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,360
Are you going to delete them or not?

157
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,880
No, I won't.

158
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,160
You're asking for trouble. Give it here.

159
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,200
I won't. What are you going to do?

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
Are you going to snatch it?

161
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,920
Delete them.

162
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,640
I won't delete them.

163
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,700
Delete the photos.

164
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,360
I won't.

165
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:32,919
Give it to me.

166
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,200
The Hezhe treasure is getting violent.

167
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,460
The Hezhe treasure is snatching things.

168
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,240
The Hezhe treasure is getting violent.

169
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,299
Snatching things.

170
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,840
You're finished, I'm telling you.

171
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,440
You're done for.

172
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll deal with you sooner or later, I swear.

173
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
A white bear has appeared in Dongji.

174
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,640
Who is it?

175
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,440
Hello.

176
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,300
I'm Sha Tang, a photographer.

177
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,480
May I ask you something?

178
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,010
About where this white bear has been spotted?

179
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,960
Hi there.

180
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
Of course.

181
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
No time like the present.

182
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,200
Let's meet tonight

183
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,520
at the Lai Ri Fang Chang bar.

184
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Thank you so much. I'll be there right away.

185
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,240
I'll show you how I deal with you.

186
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,200
Dongji.

187
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,880
Number One in Dongji.

188
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,540
Wait for me.

189
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,320
Buddy,

190
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
what would you like to drink?

191
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Anything is fine.

192
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,800
You look unfamiliar.

193
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm from out of town.

194
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm here to photograph wildlife.

195
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,900
Photographing wildlife?

196
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,240
How did you end up in my bar?

197
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm meeting someone.

198
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,720
It's a date.

199
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,800
It's not the kind of date you're thinking of.

200
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
I've arranged to meet someone here.

201
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,280
Okay, okay, okay.

202
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
There's a local blogger here.

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,320
who captured on camera

204
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
a very rare wild albino bear.

205
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,640
She goes by the name 'First Ray of Sunshine.'

206
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
She's the one who arranged to meet me here.

207
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,500
First Ray of Sunshine.

208
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,360
Bro,

209
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,940
We're closing.

210
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,820
Why are you here again?

211
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,080
Our boss

212
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
The first ray of sunlight

213
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,800
They say he's far, far above the white clouds,

214
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,680
they say he's near, close to our hearts.

215
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,200
They say she's far, at the North and East Poles,

216
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,560
they say she's near, in my homeland.

217
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Whether she's near or far,

218
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,840
her beauty is undeniable.

219
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,720
The first boat song is the most touching,

220
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,840
the first morning breeze is the sweetest.

221
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,920
It's not far from here,

222
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
just that the evening breeze of Wusuli

223
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,200
is a bit lingering.

224
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,360
It's not far from here,

225
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,840
just that the stories of the birch forest

226
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,040
are a bit entangling.

227
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,280
It's not far from here,

228
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,480
just that the melody of Errenzhuan

229
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,800
has a touch of romance.
