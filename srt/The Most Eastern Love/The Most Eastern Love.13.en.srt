1
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,650
Is it necessary to work so hard?

2
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,200
It's all for your sake.

3
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,780
You think I want to do this?

4
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,039
Hurry up and hug me.

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,160
Really listen, really see, really feel.

6
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,840
Hurry up.

7
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,480
Barbara, wait for me to come find you.

8
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,760
Since meeting Barbara, I've realized

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,079
that happiness isn't about experiencing the same things

10
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,440
with different people,

11
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,290
but rather about experiencing

12
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,570
different lives with the same person.

13
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm going to search for my happiness now.

14
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
Natasha, I'm treating tonight.

15
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,040
Remember to lock the door when you leave.

16
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,160
Lin Shanhai.

17
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,920
Natasha.

18
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,540
Lean your head closer.

19
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,960
Hurry up.

20
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,420
If we're putting on a show, let's do it properly.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,860
Natasha is watching from behind.

22
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,480
Don't blow our cover.

23
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,320
Excuse me, those two people who just went in,

24
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,040
which room are they staying in?

25
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,970
A man and a woman.

26
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm sorry, miss,

27
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,240
but that's private information about our guests.

28
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,720
Our hotel can't disclose that to you.

29
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
No, ma'am,

30
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
Who are you calling ma'am?

31
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,650
I'm the Hezhe Treasure.

32
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,600
Oh my goodness!

33
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,360
Heavens above!

34
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Oh my god!

35
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,640
Forget it, forget it.

36
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,340
Here they come.

37
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,450
I'm going to change my clothes.

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,659
Make sure you seize the opportunity.

39
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,250
Why are you here?

40
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
My Hai.

41
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,610
Can you give me another chance?

42
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,880
My girlfriend is still inside taking a shower.

44
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,640
Can you spare just a few minutes?

45
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,690
Is that okay?

46
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,940
I just want to talk to you, that's all.

47
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,280
Barbara.

48
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
I have a friend next door.

49
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,210
I'll go talk to her for a bit.

50
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,500
Please come in.

51
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
My Hai.

52
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
You scared me.

53
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Your serious look.

54
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
It's not funny at all.

55
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,240
Say what you have to say quickly.

56
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,770
I need to go find my Barbara.

57
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,740
You're angry, aren't you?

58
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,640
How can I make it up to you?

59
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,930
You've lied to me so many times.

60
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,340
You want to make it up to me?

61
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
It's not that simple.

62
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,360
You are indeed the most delicious.

63
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,980
The most delicious one I've ever tasted.

64
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,600
So?

65
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,160
Want to try something more exciting?

66
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,300
That's exactly what I had in mind.

67
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,690
Coming, coming!

68
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,480
So quick?

69
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,600
Why is it you?

70
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,370
What are you doing here?

71
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,960
I... I'm here.

72
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,250
Waiting for you.

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,409
What are you waiting for me for?

74
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,960
What's that on your face?

75
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,400
My face?

76
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,010
Oh, I just ate something spicy.

77
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,600
Spicy enough to give you red lipstick, huh?

78
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,080
Lin Shanhai, Natasha!

79
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,720
Keep your voice down, Manyue.

80
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
But Lin Shanhai isn't here.

81
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,960
I just came from the front desk.

82
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
This room was booked by Lin Shanhai.

83
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
I forgot to bring my ID card.

84
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,900
I used Lin Shanhai's ID card to book the room.

85
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,940
Why did you book a room?

86
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,200
I booked a room.

87
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,440
I booked a room for... I...

88
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,100
I booked a room to give you a surprise.

89
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,880
Surprise?

90
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,340
What surprise?

91
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,600
The surprise is...

92
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,409
Who's renovating so late at night?

93
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,159
As expected.

94
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
Men don't like to be passive.

95
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,760
Hunters always take the initiative.

96
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,560
Only little lambs give up resistance.

97
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,820
only they wait passively for their fate.

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,160
But a clever hunter...

99
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,960
sometimes appears as prey.

100
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,120
Enough.

101
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,880
Although your performance was brilliant,

102
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,160
the game is over.

103
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,000
Shanhai.

104
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,960
Natasha.

105
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,450
How does it feel to be deceived?

106
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,440
My Hai.

107
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,520
I apologize for what I've done before.

108
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I promise I won't deceive you again.

109
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,800
Do you think I would still believe you?

110
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,760
After coming back from the mountains,

111
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,120
I truly realized

112
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,760
that I've fallen deeply in love with you.

113
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I just want to be with you, properly.

114
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,560
Those who can be deceived

115
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,040
are those who believe in themselves.

116
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,240
So it's not that you were clever before,

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,980
but because I believed in you.

118
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,640
But from today on,

119
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,280
every word that comes out of your mouth,

120
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,920
I won't believe any of it.

121
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,520
Brother,

122
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,480
how did you get so emotionally attached to those clothes?

123
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,440
Let me report the results of our recent operation.

124
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
The outcome is

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,120
A surprise.

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Boss,

127
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
What do you mean by 'surprise'?

128
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
What's wrong?

129
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,760
He

130
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,840
explain what you mean by 'surprise'.

131
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,400
Surprise.

132
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,400
Manyue, why don't I

133
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,040
You explain to me what you mean by 'surprise'.

134
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,520
The surprise is that I asked Sha Tang to dress up as a woman.

135
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,200
He helped me come up with a plan to lure Natasha into a trap.

136
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,280
Let me vent this anger thoroughly.

137
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,770
This is what we call a surprise.

138
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
Then what were you doing next door?

139
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
making such a commotion.

140
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,020
We didn't do anything.

141
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,080
Who would believe that?

142
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,480
Why don't you believe it?

143
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,160
If I really had other intentions,

144
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,200
I wouldn't have brought Sha Tang along, would I?

145
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,920
I just gave her a good telling-off.

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,320
Now I've vented my anger,

147
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
and said what I needed to say.

148
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
This ill-fated relationship between us,

149
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
it's over from today.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,720
I agree.

151
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,200
The issue between your brother and Natasha,

152
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,360
it really needs to be resolved quickly.

153
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,000
Why are you involved in everything?

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,240
It's better to guide than to block,

155
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,480
and better to lead than to guide.

156
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,360
If he can really let go of Natasha,

157
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,010
everyone will be happy.

158
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,700
Can he really do it?

159
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,440
The king of picking up girls in Fuyuan is back in full force.

160
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,680
This is my determination.

161
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,560
Brother,

162
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Boss.

163
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,960
You've finally come to your senses.

164
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,880
I won't make you worry anymore.

165
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,800
Please, get up quickly.

166
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,520
Thank you.

167
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Stop right there.

168
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,220
What are you doing?

169
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
I've never seen you

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
dressed in women's clothes before.

171
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,560
Say goodbye to all your troubles.

172
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,520
Say hello to all the happiness.

173
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,160
Darling, darling.

174
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,560
Happy birthday.

175
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,200
Stop, stop.

176
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,720
Happy birthday, Yueyue.

177
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,240
Thank you.

178
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,920
I appreciate your kindness.

179
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
But you can leave now.

180
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,920
Wait.

181
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,960
Regarding the treasure of Hezhe,

182
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
which is my Yueyue,

183
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
at the Fuyuan Dongji Cultural and Arts Festival,

184
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,200
her brilliant performance

185
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,880
and the specific promotion of her personal charm.

186
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,640
Marketing promotion plan.

187
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Please review it.

188
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,000
Is it so hard to add some punctuation?

189
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,560
No.

190
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,480
Yueyue, Yueyue.

191
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
It's for your birthday.

192
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
I've been racking my brains,

193
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,240
pondering for a long time, wracking my brains.

194
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
I've come up with a flawless plan.

195
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,960
I'll contact all the major mainstream media,

196
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,040
and arrange for current affairs reporters

197
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,600
to do a comprehensive coverage

198
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,160
of your arrangements and daily life

199
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,760
at the Dongji Cultural and Arts Festival.

200
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,560
You know what?

201
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,080
Actually, I've prepared a lot more

202
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,880
things for your benefit.

203
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
But I've forgotten some of it.

204
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,640
I can only tell you my subtext.

205
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,200
Which is...

206
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,600
I dream about you every time I dream.

207
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,440
Six days a week,

208
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,840
out of seven days, I dream about you for six.

209
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,000
The body's instinct is to react.

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,840
No, the body's reaction is sincere.

211
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,170
Sincerity is always the ultimate weapon.

212
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,560
Lin Manyue.
