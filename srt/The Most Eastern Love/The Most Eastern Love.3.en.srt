1
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,570
Albino bear.

2
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Not close enough.

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,780
Need to get closer.

4
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,760
You big fool.

5
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,880
Falling for it a second time.

6
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,760
Lin Manyue.

7
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,080
You're not setting me up again, are you?

8
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
The ambush was successful.

9
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
One, two, three.

10
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,880
Fire!

11
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,210
It doesn't hurt.

12
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Let me see if it hurts.

13
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Lin Manyue.

14
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,120
What are you up to now?

15
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Oh, you're here.

16
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,040
Don't you have anything better to do?

17
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,520
Why are you haunting me like a ghost?

18
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,200
You're the ghost.

19
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,320
Your whole family are ghosts.

20
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,680
If you hadn't betrayed me yesterday,

21
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,540
and sold me out,

22
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,860
you wouldn't have run into me here today.

23
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,840
Sister,

24
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,480
you didn't handle your own business properly.

25
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,440
Why are you blaming me?

26
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,320
Who are you calling sister?

27
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,450
I'm not your sister.

28
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,560
Fine.

29
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,010
I won't call you sister.

30
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,920
I'll call you auntie.

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,480
Auntie, auntie, auntie.

32
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,770
Auntie, auntie!

33
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,890
Stop!

34
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,480
Stop!

35
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Stop, stop!

36
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,840
Stop!

37
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,160
Come down!

38
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,210
Come up here!

39
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
You're not coming down, huh?

40
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,080
Fine.

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,159
Are you coming down or not?

42
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,000
are you coming down or not?

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,460
Are you tickling the tree?

44
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,770
Alright.

45
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,160
Um...

46
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,180
The sun is about to set.

47
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,620
It's dangerous when it gets dark.

48
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's go, let's go.

49
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,240
I've brought the car back for you.

50
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,880
And I've delivered the person as well.

51
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,340
Is that satisfactory now?

52
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,540
It's passable, I suppose.

53
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,560
Considering I'm in a fairly good mood today,

54
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,400
I'll tell you an important clue.

55
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,970
You're in a fairly good mood today?

56
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,760
No, big brother, do you only hear words but not the main point?

57
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,800
Important clue.

58
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,680
If you won't listen, I'm going home.

59
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,480
Well, in that case,

60
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,320
considering you're in a fairly good mood today,

61
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,200
tell me where that bear

62
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
will appear.

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
You think I'll tell you just because you ask?

64
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Too late.

65
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,080
Take care.

66
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,120
What?

67
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,160
Don't go.

68
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,840
You think I'll stay just because you ask?

69
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,760
Too late.

70
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,440
Great photographer Sha Tang,

71
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
please help.

72
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,280
I promise I'll take you to find the bear.

73
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
I promise, I promise.

74
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll trust you one last time.

75
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
Yueyue.

76
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,760
No way, how is it you again?

77
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,000
I can't believe I trusted your nonsense from yesterday,

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,920
thinking you photographing Yueyue was an accident.

79
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,520
Speak.

80
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,560
Where did you take Yueyue today?

81
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,000
You can't just say things carelessly.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,930
Lin Manyue and I,

83
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
where we two go

84
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,240
is none of your business, right?

85
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,320
That's right. Mr. Zhong, you're overstepping your bounds.

86
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,159
Yueyue.

87
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,400
Don't be fooled by this shutter-presser.

88
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,120
All that talk about freedom and ideals from all over the place.

89
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,080
Those are all unrealistic fantasies.

90
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,940
He can't give you true happiness.

91
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,880
No matter how much you say, it's useless, Zhong Ziqing.

92
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,400
Let me formally introduce.

93
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680
Photographer Sha Tang.

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,280
He's the boyfriend I, Lin Manyue, have chosen.

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
Don't joke around, Yueyue.

96
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,060
Do I look like I'm joking with you?

97
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,920
Have you heard of love at first sight?

98
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,380
That's what I felt for him.

99
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,800
The two of us have done

100
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
many romantic things.

101
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,130
We climbed trees together.

102
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,840
We went to the wild to photograph small animals together.

103
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,880
We trekked across snowy fields together.

104
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,400
Do you understand this feeling of freedom?

105
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,120
You lied to me yesterday.

106
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
Do you think I'd believe you again?

107
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
She didn't lie to you.

108
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,679
I am her boyfriend.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,919
You should leave now.

110
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,560
She doesn't like you.

111
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
There's no point in hanging around here.

112
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,890
I'm not going anywhere.

113
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,640
You think I don't know?

114
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,480
She's just using you as a shield.

115
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm a shield?

116
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,560
Shield.

117
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,900
Don't you understand?

118
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,360
Shield.

119
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,320
Amulet.

120
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,920
Excuse.

121
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,040
Pretext.

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,780
Aren't you her boyfriend?

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,080
Prove it then.

124
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,580
It's like seeing pigs fly.

125
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
What's going on here?

126
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,840
Let me explain. It's not what you think.

127
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,600
Manyue, who is this young man?

128
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,360
When did you meet him?

129
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
He looks quite presentable. Not bad at all.

130
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
You've never mentioned him before.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,060
Where does he work?

132
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,880
Manyue,

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
how did you two meet?

134
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,680
Where, where does he work?

135
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,080
I heard that the richest man in Fuyuan

136
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,570
was snatched away by a mere photographer.

137
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,170
You're well-informed.

138
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,200
Go on.

139
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
What do you plan to do?

140
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,920
As you would say,

141
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,810
it's better to use strategy than brute force.

142
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,560
You don't understand women,

143
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,760
but I understand men.

144
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,440
I see.

145
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,080
I understand.

146
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
But I need to see what you're capable of first.

147
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,210
It's not too difficult,

148
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,580
but you are the richest man in Fuyuan.

149
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
It'll cost extra.

150
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,920
Love is priceless.

151
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,200
Deal. Wait for my good news.

152
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,890
Tell me about it.

153
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,740
Are you two dating?

154
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,600
No.

155
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,680
If not, then why did you kiss her?

156
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,480
I kissed Lin Manyue to help her out of an awkward situation.

157
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,200
Don't be angry.

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,130
I know my sister.

159
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
You kissed her.

160
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,800
She didn't... you know...

161
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,930
It only means she has feelings for you.

162
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,960
She didn't... either...

163
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,490
Brother, be brave and love.

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,740
I support you, bro.

165
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,060
Excuse me, sir,

166
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,960
would you mind buying me a drink?

167
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,540
Your friend...

168
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,120
Neglecting a beautiful lady like this,

169
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,380
doesn't seem very gentlemanly, does it?

170
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,320
We don't know each other, do we?

171
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,850
Buy me a drink and we'll get to know each other.

172
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,850
You need a romantic encounter,

173
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,880
not sitting here with a man,

174
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
drinking in silence.

175
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm sorry,

176
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,610
but I'm not interested.

177
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,050
Excuse me, miss,

178
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,760
may I buy you a drink?

179
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Looks like she's encountered a player.

180
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,080
And she's met her match.

181
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,640
How about

182
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,920
we kill two birds with one stone?

183
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,970
We're not doing anything else anyway.

184
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,920
I didn't expect this brat to be so cooperative.

185
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,380
To get rid of Zhong Ziqing,

186
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
I'll use him as my shield.
