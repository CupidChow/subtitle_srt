00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
Photographer Sha Tang.

2
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,479
He's the boyfriend I, Lin Manyue, have chosen.

3
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,740
She's not lying to you.

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,460
I am indeed her boyfriend.

5
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,160
The weather is particularly nice today.

6
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
I have a feeling

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,130
we'll definitely get some good shots.

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,700
Manyue, you're here so early.

9
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,280
Morning.

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,079
Good morning.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
It's been a while since I've moved around.

12
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,040
Yeah,

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
I came to warm up a bit.

14
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
I wanted to ask...

15
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Could you take me up the mountain to find bears?

16
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,800
Don't misunderstand.

17
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
I don't mean to threaten you.

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
I'm asking for your help.

19
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,130
Maybe I misunderstood.

21
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm preparing to go into the mountains now.

22
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,170
Wish me luck.

23
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,160
The city has issued a yellow alert for heavy snow.

24
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,600
It is expected to start from 16:00 today

25
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
and continue until 05:00 tomorrow.

26
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,120
Strong winds in some areas.

27
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,480
Snow accumulation and icy roads are expected.

28
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Citizens are advised to limit outdoor activities.

29
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,720
Please avoid wilderness areas and forests.

30
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,380
Be prepared for emergencies.

31
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,120
Sha Tang.

32
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,440
Sha Tang.

33
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,079
Sha Tang.

34
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,960
Sha Tang.

35
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,800
Sha Tang.

36
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,600
Sha Tang.

37
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,079
Sha Tang.

38
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,280
Sha Tang.

39
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
Sha Tang.

40
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
Sha Tang.

41
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,040
Sha Tang.

42
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,640
You don't want the comfort of a studio that's warm in winter and cool in summer,

43
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,600
but insist on going to such a far and cold place.

44
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,120
You're just making things hard for yourself.

45
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,200
I really don't understand what you're thinking.

46
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Just give it a try.

47
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,200
It won't do any harm.

48
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,260
You've got ideals.

49
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,480
You're something else.

50
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
Minus twenty degrees.

51
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,200
The easternmost point of our country.

52
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,360
You're from Guangxi.

53
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Do you have any idea what that means?

54
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,370
I don't know.

55
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,980
But I just feel that this place

56
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,410
will have miracles happen.

57
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,160
Sha Tang.

58
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,880
Sha Tang.

59
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,480
Sha Tang.

60
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,720
Sha Tang.

61
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,200
Sha Tang.

62
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,560
Wake up.

63
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,560
wake up.

64
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,360
Sha Tang.

65
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,760
You're awake.

66
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,540
You still came.

67
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,810
If I hadn't come,

68
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,780
you would have frozen to death in the mountains.

69
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,320
You took them off yourself. It has nothing to do with me.

70
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,580
The pants are still on.

71
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
Hypothermia is no small matter.

72
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,930
Lie down.

73
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
What are you doing?

74
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,760
Stones.

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,600
To warm up.

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
You need to absorb heat now.

77
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,810
Tell me when they cool down.

78
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,840
How are you feeling? Any better?

79
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,020
Your clothes are dry. Put them on.

80
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,370
Why don't you...

81
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,490
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

82
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,530
Where is this place?

83
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
Cuoluozi.

84
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
What is Cuoluozi?

85
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
You don't know what Cuoluozi is?

86
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,610
Let me explain it to you.

87
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,840
Well, Cuoluozi

88
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
In the earliest times of our Hezhe people,

89
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,960
it was used to shelter hunters from wind and rain.

90
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,360
But aren't people not hunting anymore now?

91
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,360
That's exactly what I asked my grandfather.

92
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,240
This Cuoluozi was built by my grandfather.

93
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,200
My grandfather said,

94
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,720
this Cuoluozi is built here

95
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,160
to also help people who occasionally get lost

96
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
save their lives.

97
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,290
Right, lost people.

98
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
Then I should thank your grandfather.

99
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,020
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

100
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,360
If it weren't for me

101
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,960
coming here every now and then to replenish food,

102
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
you'd be starving today.

103
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,240
Thank you too.

104
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,760
Received.

105
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,360
If I had known that photo

106
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,400
would cause you so much trouble,

107
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,730
I definitely wouldn't have posted it.

108
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
I forgive you.

110
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,640
It's my fault for not understanding the weather.

111
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
rashly climbing the mountain.

112
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Now you've come to rescue me,

113
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
and ended up trapped here.

114
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,360
That's right.

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,860
Didn't I tell you earlier?

116
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,280
It's quite scary in these mountains at night.

117
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,540
it's quite dangerous.

118
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,280
Since we're here, let's make the best of it.

119
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,160
Tell me about yourself.

120
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,890
Why are you so determined to find that white bear?

121
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,160
Actually,

122
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,560
it's not an ordinary white bear.

123
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,520
I know.

124
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
It's an Asian black bear

125
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,740
with albinism.

126
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,900
A child of the moon.

127
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,240
Hold on a moment.

128
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,700
Let me show you something.

129
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,280
This is what I photographed in Inner Mongolia.

130
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,340
An albino gazelle.

131
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,460
This is an albino peacock I photographed in Yunnan.

132
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,770
This is so beautiful, isn't it?

133
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,580
You think it's beautiful too.

134
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
There are even more beautiful ones after this.

135
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,220
An albino wolf.

136
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
An albino owl.

137
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,960
This is an albino chimpanzee.

138
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,020
An albino dolphin.

139
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,040
This is an albino lobster.

140
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,360
An albino lobster.

141
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
I know about this one.

142
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
An albino monkey.

143
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,400
What's wrong?

144
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
To take this photo,

145
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
I stayed in the mountains for a whole month.

146
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,120
I missed the only chance

147
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,610
to win an award in my life so far.

148
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,010
That's quite a pity.

149
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,620
It's not a pity.

150
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
Because this is my dream.

151
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,160
Dream.

152
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,880
In my studio,

153
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,080
from this window to this door,

154
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,360
there's a wall this big.

155
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,640
I've put a map on it.

156
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,400
I've pinned all the albino animals I've photographed across the country

157
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,640
according to where they were found.

158
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,970
All of them are on there.

159
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,040
You're planning to travel all over China.

160
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,160
Of course I'm going to travel all over China.

161
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,560
I want to fill up that map.

162
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,040
Then hold an exhibition.

163
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,080
Through this exhibition,

164
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I want more people

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
to recognize these albino spirits.

166
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,180
I want to say

167
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
albino animals are not ugly.

168
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,640
I think they're pretty cool.

169
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,370
I think you're pretty cool now.

170
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,370
Sha Tang,

171
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,730
I'll definitely help you find the white bear.

172
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
After I find this albino bear,

173
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,440
I can fill in

174
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,760
the last blank spot on my map.

175
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
Then I can hold the exhibition.

176
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,600
After the exhibition,

177
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,320
I'll donate all the proceeds

178
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,880
to albinism organizations.

179
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Because I think albinism organizations

180
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,760
and what they do

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,330
are even cooler than me.

182
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,560
I think I'm pretty cool now too.

183
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm cool too.

184
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,900
We're a cool combination.

185
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,940
Cool girls.

186
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,560
Cool boys.

187
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
Let's have some soup.

188
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,970
It's delicious.

189
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
Although I previously wanted to use him as a shield,

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,760
however,

191
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,520
in my date with Bai Xiong,

192
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
having him join us

193
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,090
isn't so bad either.

194
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Didn't you say three days?

195
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,880
How many sets of three days has it been now?

196
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,280
Give me just a few more days,

197
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,880
I'll get photos of Bai Xiong and go back immediately.

198
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,440
There's no room for negotiation, Sha Tang.

199
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,200
The other party has already filed a lawsuit.

200
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
You must come back and resolve this matter yourself.

201
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
But I've already found

202
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720
the person who photographed the polar bear.

203
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,640
And she promised me

204
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,200
that she would definitely help me find the polar bear.

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Can I come back as soon as I photograph the polar bear?

206
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
Impossible.

207
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,040
The studio has already been shut down.

208
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,960
You need to come back first.

209
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,240
Let's resolve this matter.

210
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,880
After that, you can go wherever you want.

211
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,610
Is that okay?

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,890
Three more days.

213
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll come back whether I find the bear or not.

214
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
I'll trust you one last time.

215
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,440
If you can't make it back in time,

216
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,100
you'll have to face the consequences yourself.

217
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,730
Sha Tang.

218
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,920
Where are you going?

219
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,650
The brewery.

220
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,490
The brewery.

221
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,600
We've had over three thousand cases returned just this morning.

222
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,860
What are we going to do?

223
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,840
Dad,

224
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,570
what's going on?

225
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
This is all minor stuff.

226
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,000
You call this minor?

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,800
Take a look at this.

228
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
How many cases have been returned this morning?

229
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,760
Returns? What does that mean?

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,440
Someone's poaching our business.

231
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,570
Explain it clearly.

232
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,080
I heard someone's become the agent for Qianweina Beer.

233
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,200
They've even bought out several of our local breweries,

234
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,060
acquired them.

235
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,880
and opened up their sales channels.

236
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,640
They're even coming to my bar to promote their products,

237
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,160
saying they'll only sell their beer.

238
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,620
Who do they think they are?

239
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,880
You can go back first.

240
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,800
We'll...

241
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,880
We'll find a way to solve this.

242
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,400
Manyue,

243
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,800
the market conditions aren't good right now.

244
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,640
This kind of thing happens often.

245
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,280
Besides,

246
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,360
they're a big brand, a big manufacturer.

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,080
Our Liangjiang Beer is an old brand.

248
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,120
It's normal that we can't compete with them.

249
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,850
It's normal.

250
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,140
We'll keep going for as long as we can,

251
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
for as long as we can.

252
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,960
Dad.

253
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,640
Dad.

254
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,840
Sha Tang.

255
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,940
Let me help you.

256
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,360
Two heads are better than one.
