1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,240
Jun Nan.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,760
Feng Xiang.

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,040
Qiang.

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,680
Hang.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,320
Zhen Lin.

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,000
Hao Lasi Geng Lin Tong Hui Ying Le Han.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,640
Jun Tong Ming Xin.

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,520
Liang.

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Stop! What the hell are you dancing?

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,240
When can I expect to learn from you guys?

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,640
What is street god dance?

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,039
It's supposed to be soft yet strong.

13
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,880
Your hips,

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,200
your shoulders, your neck,

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,000
they're as stiff as freshly rolled steel plates.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Useless. Get out!

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,330
I'll have to rely on myself.

18
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,079
Why did you bring me here?

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,600
I've taught you so many techniques of the jaw harp.

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Today, I'll teach you something more soulful.

21
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,530
Give it a try.

22
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,040
Sha Tang,

23
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,480
are you also distracted

24
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,380
by thoughts of our future?

25
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,440
You not only know how to play the instrument,

26
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,770
but you can also make it.

27
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
Craftsmen who can make jaw harps

28
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,340
are rare nowadays.

29
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,140
I've only learned the basics.

30
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
In the past, these instruments were made from fish bones.

31
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,360
The sound was crisper and had more texture.

32
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
It's a pity. It's been a long time

33
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,200
since I've touched a jaw harp made from fish bones.

34
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Try it.

35
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,080
It's fixed.

36
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,520
Manyue.

37
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,320
That bear.

38
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,159
is gone.

39
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,400
I know.

40
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,600
I want to say,

41
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,040
bear migration is a natural law.

42
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,120
but some things

43
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,420
are more important than chasing dreams.

44
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,480
The assessment officially begins.

45
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Please welcome the first contestant,

46
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,080
Mr. Zhong Ziqing.

47
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
Mr. Zhong Ziqing.

48
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,799
May I ask, why are you dressed like this to perform the Lu Shen dance?

49
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,120
This is a grand fusion of technology and culture.

50
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,200
It's time for the Cyber Lu Shen dance performance.

51
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,440
I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore.

52
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,770
I can't take it anymore.

53
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Esteemed judges,

54
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,840
Next, I'd like to formally introduce my partner.

55
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
Stop, stop, stop!

56
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,840
The Lu Shen dance is such a sacred activity,

57
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,120
what have you turned it into?

58
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,680
This is a combination of intangible cultural heritage and technology.

59
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
What a great idea.

60
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,400
Don't be so old-fashioned.

61
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,160
I don't see any combination.

62
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,240
I only see your lack of respect.

63
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,880
For the art left by our ancestors,

64
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
you have no reverence.

65
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
I think you don't need to perform anymore.

66
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,300
Get out of here now.

67
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
I've already invested.

68
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
And I can't even get on stage?

69
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Is there no justice?

70
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,280
The organizing committee doesn't need

71
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,840
someone like you who doesn't respect art.

72
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,800
Your investment

73
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,050
Leave immediately.

74
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,810
Mr. Zhong Ziqing, please leave the premises.

75
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,920
Please exit.

76
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
Please.

77
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,290
It's rigged!

78
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,360
It's rigged!

79
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,080
The art circle is all rigged!

80
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,440
It's rigged!

81
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,360
This Zhong Ziqing

82
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,580
has too many tricks up his sleeve.

83
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,960
No, I actually admire his creativity.

84
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,120
Alright, let's welcome the next one.

85
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,850
Mr. Sha Tang, come on, let's go.

86
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,960
Please begin your performance.

87
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,000
Dongji

88
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,800
Charming East

89
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,280
Charm

90
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,160
Please allow us to perform an additional segment of the Road God Dance.

91
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,720
Although due to time constraints,

92
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,600
the Road God Dance cannot be

93
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,330
performed at the Winter Cultural Arts Festival.

94
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,200
There are some traditions

95
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
that, although not mainstream enough,

96
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,280
but

97
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
should not be buried and forgotten.

98
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,480
They say he's far away, high up in the white clouds.

99
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,360
They say he's close, right here in our hearts.

100
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,880
They say she's far, at the North and East Poles.

101
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,240
They say she's near, in my homeland.

102
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Whether she's near or far,

103
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,520
her beauty is undeniable.

104
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,400
The first note of a boat song is the most touching.

105
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,520
The first breeze of morning is the sweetest.

106
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,600
It's not far from here.

107
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,360
It's just that the evening breeze of Wusuli

108
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,880
is a bit lingering.

109
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,040
It's not far from here.

110
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,520
It's just that the stories of the birch forest

111
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,720
are a bit entangling.

112
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,960
It's not far from here.

113
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,160
It's just that the melodies of Errenzhuan

114
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,480
have a touch of romance.
