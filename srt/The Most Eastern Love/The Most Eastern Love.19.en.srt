1
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,800
Next, let's welcome

2
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Lin Manyue, the treasure of the Hezhe people,

3
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,840
and her male partner to perform

4
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,120
Imakan, the mouth harp.

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,300
What's that supposed to mean?

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,840
Don't I have a name?

7
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,170
And 'male partner'?

8
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,120
next,

10
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,880
let's give a warm round of applause

11
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,960
to welcome the great photographer Sha Tang from Guangxi

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,000
and his female partner.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,880
No, no, no.

14
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,930
You're the main act,

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,450
I'm just a guest.

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,289
Let's go, guest.

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,440
Alright, host.

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,360
Good luck.

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,960
Why?

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,680
The one who can stand beside you

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,600
has never been me.

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,840
Ladies and gentlemen,

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,079
let's give a round of applause

24
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,200
to celebrate our boss,

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
Lin Manyue, the treasure of Hezhe,

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,079
and her male companion, Sha Tang,

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,770
her boyfriend Sha Tang,

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,000
for their outstanding performance at the Dongji Cultural Arts Festival,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,120
leading our Hezhe intangible cultural heritage

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,320
to shine once again.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,280
Furthermore, furthermore, furthermore.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,240
To celebrate our boss

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,280
being awarded the title of Hezhe Folk Culture Ambassador,

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,440
Yimakan Technique Promoter,

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,880
and East Pole Tourism Image Ambassador,

36
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,280
tonight, drinks are on the house.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,740
All expenses will be covered by yours truly.

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,460
Let's get this party started!

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
The man of the hour at the celebration party.

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,920
What are you doing hiding here?

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,840
Don't say that.

42
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,420
I'm not the man of the hour.

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm your boy toy.

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,880
Try this, it's a non-alcoholic cocktail.

45
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,040
What are you?

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,840
Boyfriend.

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,460
Thank you, my male concubine.

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,490
You're welcome.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,130
I'm glad you like it.

50
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,120
From now on, it's not enough that only I like it.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,380
You have to like it too.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,400
Manyue,

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
because you like it,

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I like it too.

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,450
You've learned how to talk.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,360
Have I?

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
You've got quite a way with words.

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,360
Who taught you that?

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,760
Where did you learn that?

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,980
What are you doing?

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,000
Come on, come on.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,880
On such a happy day,

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,140
we should take a photo.

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,560
Come on,

65
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,900
look at the camera.

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,920
Three, two, one,

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,080
cheese!

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,360
What's wrong?

69
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,880
I sincerely hope you can find that bear in Siberia.

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

71
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,440
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

72
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,900
I will definitely find it.

73
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,740
I'll take you back to Guangxi.

74
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,400
Are you sure they're living together now?

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,640
I saw Sha Tang and Lin Manyue

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,800
enter Lin Manyue's house together.

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,530
They didn't come out all night.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,400
First, they fall in love,

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,260
then they get married,

80
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,200
go to the Dongji Cultural Arts Festival together,

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,980
and now they're living together.

82
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,770
Do you think I'm a love reality show observer?

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,280
Yueyue,

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,760
No.

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
Lin Manyue,

86
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,640
don't blame me.

87
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,250
You forced us to do this.

88
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,280
Remove all traces of her,

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,920
clear them all away.

90
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,800
Everything.

91
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't you understand? Get out!

92
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Okay.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,280
I never want to see her again.

94
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,540
The person I asked you to find,

95
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
has been found.

96
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,380
They're waiting outside.

97
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,370
What are we waiting for?

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,080
Bring her in.

99
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,920
It's not like only the Hezhe treasure

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,800
is worthy of Dongji's richest man.

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,080
Star of Hezhe.

102
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,520
Light of Hezhe.

103
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,240
I can have as much as I want.

104
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
as much as you want.

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,680
What's your name?

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
Lu Xiaowan.

107
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,320
Lu Xiaowan.

108
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,680
That doesn't sound good.

109
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
From now on, you'll be called Lu Manyue.

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,620
You know why I called you here, right?

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,880
To learn from the senior masters of intangible cultural heritage.

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,200
I'll do my best.

113
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,440
Tell me.

114
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
How long will it take to surpass Lin Manyue?

115
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm afraid...

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
There's nothing to be afraid of.

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,880
I'll invite the most expensive master to come out of retirement and teach you.

118
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,640
I'll build you the most luxurious team.

119
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,800
I'll promote you.

120
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
And all you need to do is defeat Lin Manyue.

121
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,920
Become the new treasure of Hezhe.

122
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,760
Manyue, whether in terms of ability or popularity,

123
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,360
is not someone I can compare to.

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Otherwise...

125
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,880
Trust me,

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,440
she'll soon become a rat crossing the street,

127
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,900
a stink bug in the rice jar.

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,400
You just need to focus on beating her.

129
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,080
I can do whatever it takes.

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,640
Isn't that a bit too...

131
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,900
Despicable, treacherous, and cunning.

132
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,040
History can be rewritten as one pleases, young lady.

133
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,000
And you just need to focus on beating her.

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,040
Only the victors get to write history.

135
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
Do you want to succeed?

136
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,680
Do you want to stand out?

137
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,060
Arrange for her to start training immediately.

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,159
Sha Tang left.

139
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,440
My life went on as usual.

140
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,480
Although the inheritance of skills is hard work,

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,440
it's worth it.

142
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,100
With Natasha as the new owner, the bar

143
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,480
is thriving.

144
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,960
Life is sweet and beautiful.

145
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,200
However,

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,930
beneath this tranquil daily life,

147
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
a premeditated crisis

148
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,360
is approaching me.

149
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
You spendthrift!

150
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,360
You run a bar to sell alcohol, to sell alcohol!

151
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,930
But you end up drinking more than you sell.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,600
What? Is it so blissful to turn your hobby into a profession?

153
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Is it really blissful?

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Isn't it so blissful?

156
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,040
At worst, I'll drink less in the future.

157
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,370
Isn't that good enough?

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
Manyue is right.

159
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,280
If not disciplined for three days, one will be up to no good.

160
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,960
Can't she teach something good?

161
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,040
What are you talking about?

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,680
Honey, I mean, well...

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
When we're alone, you can scold or hit me if you need to.

164
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,520
But when others are around, please give me a little face.

165
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,000
After all, I'm a grown man.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,600
Right?

167
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,360
Who started this rumor?

168
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
Isn't this nonsense?

169
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
What happened?

170
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,240
What's the fuss all about?

171
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Aren't these all edited?

172
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,340
Who's stirring things up?

173
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,080
My face has been cropped out.

174
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
Is that the point?

175
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,970
What are you two looking at?

176
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,160
Um, Natasha,

177
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,920
you... you should...

178
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,360
Go away, you're acting like an old woman.

179
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,220
Get out of here.

180
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,800
Go, go, go.

181
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,160
Manyue, look,

182
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,600
his face has been cropped out.
