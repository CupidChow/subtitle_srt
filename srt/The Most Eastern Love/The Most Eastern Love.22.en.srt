1
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,570
What time is it already?

2
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,320
Why haven't those two come back yet?

3
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,640
We're shipping to Guangxi today.

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,240
They're all busy at the brewery.

5
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,640
I heard from your brother

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
that they ordered 100,000 cases of cranberry beer.

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,680
Is that true?

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,400
It is.

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,760
That's two months' worth of production.

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,920
Isn't this like manna from heaven?

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't believe in such windfalls.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,770
What do you mean?

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,920
We're back.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
You've worked hard, you've worked hard.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,600
What's wrong, honey?

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,600
You've worked hard, you've worked hard.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,860
In all my years of work,

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,039
this is the first time I've received such a big order.

19
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,759
Come, come, let me give you a massage.

20
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,220
The young boss of the brewery has become a mere loading worker.

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,850
Let's stick to the plan.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,520
Boss, dinner's ready!

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,320
Coming!

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
Hurry up, daughter.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,360
Coming!

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
Manyue, dinner's ready!

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Coming!

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,920
We're just waiting for you.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,200
Coming!

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,880
Daughter.

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,080
Let me say a few words.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,330
Please go ahead.

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Our family,

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,280
it's been a while since we've been together.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,610
It's nice to have a family reunion dinner.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,680
It would be great if Xiao Sha were here.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,930
That's right, boss.

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,000
Xiao Sha has been in Siberia for some time now.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Isn't he coming back yet?

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,240
He said a couple of days ago that he found traces of the bear.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,320
I guess he's probably chased it all the way to its den by now.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,120
Manyue,

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,600
Siberia is

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,040
even colder than here.

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,920
You should call him more often when you're free,

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,250
to send him some warmth.

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,090
Sister-in-law,

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,600
aren't you afraid he might meet someone like me there,

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,160
a charming Russian girl?

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,079
Brother,

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,440
why do I feel like your conversation today

52
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
is organized and premeditated?

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
We are indeed premeditated.

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,240
Your father and I,

55
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,960
we both quite like Xiao Sha.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,480
Yes.

57
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,160
Xiao Sha is a good young man.

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,560
You're not getting any younger either.

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm not that old,

60
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,080
boss.

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,280
You should learn from your brother about this.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,760
If you love, love bravely.

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,560
Take the initiative, give it your all.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
What should I learn from you?

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
To be half-dead for love?

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,290
Sister-in-law,

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,360
you've helped a lot for me and Shanhai before.

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,480
If you want to make a move on Sha Tang,

69
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,140
I'll help you with the assist.

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,880
I guarantee it'll be a piece of cake.

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,640
Like catching a turtle in a jar.

72
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,160
Sister-in-law, your choice of words...

73
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,880
Really

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,760
fitting.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Although Natasha's wording is inappropriate,

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,920
her meaning is correct.

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,960
Regarding the matter of Xiao Sha,

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,320
we all have the same opinion.

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,440
Daughter,

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,960
as long as you're willing,

81
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,040
we will fully support you.

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
Support you.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
Support you.

84
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,240
Support you.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,200
Cheers.

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,480
Come on,

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
let's hope Xiao Sha comes back soon.

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,730
The number you have dialed is powered off.

89
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,440
Please try again later.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Where's Sha Tang?

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
He's fine.

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,020
He came to get revenge for you.

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,480
he beat me up,

94
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,840
he's tired.

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
I found a place for him to rest.

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,930
What do you mean by that?

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,659
What have you done to Sha Tang?

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,810
I'm not lying to you.

99
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,610
The evidence is right there on my face.

100
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,410
You'd better not be lying to me.

101
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,480
Give me one last chance.

102
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,640
One last time.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,320
Give me five minutes.

104
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,490
I'll return Shatang to you.

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,880
If you're lying to me,

106
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll personally send you to prison.

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
Some things

108
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
are not meant to be mine.

109
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,240
Then I have no reason

110
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
to keep them anymore.

111
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,200
I just want them to meet their true owner

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,840
before they are destroyed.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,730
I've imagined countless times

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
that one day you would agree to marry me.

115
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,220
Then I would turn everything here into gifts

116
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,860
and give them to you one by one.

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,170
I just never thought

118
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,450
that in the end, it would be a farewell.

119
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,680
Thank you for doing all this.

120
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,020
Shatang just asked me a question.

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm wondering,

122
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,040
do I really like you, Lin Manyue,

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,860
or the Hezhe treasure?

124
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,570
But what's the difference?

125
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,120
So this is the difference between you and Shatang.

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,780
How is Shatang better than me?

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
There's no comparison between you two.

128
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
You can never become him,

129
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,760
and he will never become you.

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,500
He is who he is, and you are who you are.

131
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,530
Perhaps after all these years,

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,800
I don't even know

133
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
what I truly like anymore.

134
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Maybe all I wanted was a conclusion.

135
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,540
I've fought for it,

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,640
I've tried to take it,

137
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,260
Take care of yourself from now on.

138
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,970
I won't bother you anymore.

139
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,600
Thank you.

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Where is Sha Tang?

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,680
this is the fifth time

142
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,520
I've seen his back.

143
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Are you stupid?

145
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
You want to beat up Zhong Ziqing?

146
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,690
you should have told me!

147
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,520
I've been wanting to beat him up for a long time.

148
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,080
Does it hurt?

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,640
It hurts.

150
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,040
Explain yourself.

151
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,160
Zhong Ziqing.

152
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,330
Hallucination.

153
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Isn't the one pressing the shutter in Siberia?

154
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Are you even a man?

155
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
If you have a problem, come at me.

156
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,240
What?

157
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,700
You want to avenge Lin Manyue?

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,260
I've been tolerating you for a long time.

159
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,960
Sha, you've gone mad.

160
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,600
You're going to fight me here?

161
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,240
Since I'm already here,

162
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,040
there's nothing to be afraid of.

163
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,020
Today, for Lin Manyue's sake,

164
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,080
I've been tolerating you for a long time.

165
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,760
Come on!

166
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,880
Come on!

167
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,880
If it weren't for you,

168
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,940
we would have been together long ago.

169
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,440
Even without me,

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,320
she would never like a madman like you.

171
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
You drove me to madness.

172
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,840
You drove me to it.

173
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
I first met her

174
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,200
when I was sixteen.

175
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,520
I was an ordinary high school student then.

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,400
She was already a treasure of the Hezhe people.

177
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,170
I wanted to give her better things,

178
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,040
so I studied hard

179
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,800
and worked tirelessly to start a business.

180
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Whenever I felt like giving up,

181
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,960
I told myself,

182
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,880
'Get over this hurdle,

183
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
and you'll be able to see her in a better way.'

184
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,400
When I finally had the confidence to pursue her,

185
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,360
she told me

186
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,740
that she didn't like me at all.

187
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,380
I am the richest man in Fuyuan.

188
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,280
I am the richest man in Fuyuan.

189
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
She doesn't like me.

190
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,840
What she likes has never been money

191
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,120
or material things.

192
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,600
I couldn't accept it.

193
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,740
If I didn't have opportunities, I created them.

194
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,290
I created chances for us to be alone together.

195
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,480
Don't I know

196
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,080
that I look like a madman now?

197
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,760
Don't I know that in others' eyes,

198
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
I look like a clown?

199
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,400
I just wanted to see her in a different way each time,

200
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,920
to give her some novelty.

201
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
I comforted myself,

202
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,560
saying, 'Keep going, keep going.'

203
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,160
Maybe the next performance

204
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,560
will be the one she likes.

205
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,120
Love has never been something you can perform.

206
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,320
Do you think you're great?

207
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,760
Isn't it great?

208
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,420
Hasn't she been moved after all these years?

209
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,740
From beginning to end,

210
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,050
the only one you've moved is yourself.

211
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,880
I came here to fight you today

212
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,880
for Lin Manyue.

213
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,460
And who are you doing this for?

214
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,480
Sha Tang,

215
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,640
can you do me a favor?
