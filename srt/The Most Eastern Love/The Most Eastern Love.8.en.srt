1
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,600
One, two, one.

2
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,000
Let go.

3
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm coming empty-handed.

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,360
I haven't prepared anything.

5
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,090
Maybe we should just forget it.

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
What's there to prepare?

7
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,480
A chance encounter is better than a planned meeting.

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,960
There's no better day than today.

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,440
You've been such a great help to our family's winery.

10
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,570
My mom has even said,

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,800
'If I don't bring you home, I might as well not come back at all.'

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,930
Since when did you become so obedient?

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,760
Never mind, never mind.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,080
It's not like this is your first time meeting them.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,240
Don't say anything rash later.

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,280
Follow my lead.

17
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,160
That's more like it.

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,479
Finally, you're here, Xiao Sha.

19
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,520
Your Uncle Lin has been busy in the kitchen for hours.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,560
Come in, come in quickly.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,360
Okay, Auntie.

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Daughter, let me say a few words.

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,479
Go ahead.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,759
Alright, we Northeasterners,

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,500
we don't beat around the bush.

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,479
First of all,

27
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,600
welcome to Fuyuan, Xiao Sha.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,260
As the old saying goes,

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,360
'Fate brings people together from far and wide.'

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,440
The fact that we can sit together at this table,

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,520
that's fate.

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,760
I'm happy today,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,240
so let's have a toast to our fateful meeting.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,680
Alright,

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,600
let's drink up.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Welcome.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
And for this second glass,

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,520
I thank you for your contributions to the factory.

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
Alright, let's do it.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,600
Bottoms up!

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,280
Cheers!

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,579
Aren't you going to toast with me?

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,850
Wow, southerners can drink this well too?

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,440
Not bad.

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,320
My alcohol tolerance is quite good.

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
Little Sha,

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,760
this third glass of wine,

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,700
I, your uncle, toast to you alone.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,600
My daughter,

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,880
I know her character and behavior.

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,410
Even if you get angry, I still have to say this.

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,520
When it's cold,

54
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,760
warm her hands.

55
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,360
If she's being bullied,

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,520
stand up for her.

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
If she has a headache or fever,

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,340
bring her medicine and water.

59
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
If you can do these things,

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,120
then let's finish this drink, you and I.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,040
Cheers!

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Come on, eat up.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
eat up, kids.

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
eat, eat, eat.

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,960
try this.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Xiao Sha,

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
what are your plans now?

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,560
I promised Sha Tang

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,600
to take him to find the albino bear.

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,680
There's no time like the present.

71
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
Why don't we leave tomorrow?

72
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,160
I'm leaving Fuyuan tomorrow.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,280
Tomorrow? That's so sudden.

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,640
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,600
So you're not going to look for the bear?

76
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
What about you and my sister...

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,320
No, I mean, when will you be back?

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,450
My partner has been urging me for days.

79
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,560
They booked my flight two days ago.

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,760
Shan Hai,

81
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,700
can you drive us to buy two bundles of chives?

82
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,120
We'll make dumplings tonight as a farewell meal for Xiao Sha.

83
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
You had already set a date to go back.

84
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,920
The studio has been closed for three days.

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
It's already the final deadline.

86
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,960
if I don't go back now,

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,440
Why didn't you tell me?

88
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,200
you didn't dare to say it?

89
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,730
or you didn't want to say it?

90
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,900
You're already busy enough with the winery.

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
I can't distract you any further.

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
Then you

93
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,620
spent all your remaining three days helping me.

94
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,690
Don't you regret it?

95
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,920
No regrets.

96
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,220
Haven't we already found the White Bear?

97
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,600
It's good wine.

98
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,840
What's this wine called?

99
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,090
White Painted Bear.

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,480
What time is your flight tomorrow?

101
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,410
I'll see you off.

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,240
Okay.

103
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,520
This is as far as I can go.

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,400
Actually,

105
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,540
we could chat a bit longer.

106
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
There's still

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,300
five minutes left.

108
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,100
Oh, right. I...

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,020
I think you should stop drinking from now on.

110
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,780
It's too scary when you drink.

111
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,440
I thought you were going to say something else.

112
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,880
Okay, got it.

113
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,090
I'm leaving.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,730
Are you still working on your albino version map?

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,760
Time's up.

116
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,080
Bye-bye.

117
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,080
Bye-bye.

118
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,320
This is the third time

119
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,850
I've watched his back as he leaves.

120
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
I never thought

121
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,700
it would be a farewell.

122
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,440
Hello?

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Manyue, a tour group from Guangxi has arrived.

124
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,280
We need you to guide them.

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,320
What a heavy snow.

126
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,920
It's so high.

127
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,840
This is really high.

128
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,880
Berry Bear.

129
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,840
Look, everyone!

130
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,570
There's rime frost over there.

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,240
This bridge is so high.

132
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,440
Berry Bear is so tall.

133
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,280
My life

134
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,580
seems to have returned to normal.

135
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,680
But Guangxi, photography,

136
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
sugar oranges,

137
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
these usually insignificant words

138
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,000
now constantly remind me of

139
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
the one who suddenly entered my world

140
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
and then abruptly disappeared.

141
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Sister,

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,160
Sister,

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,400
let's play house together.

144
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,560
Mom.

145
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,000
Zhong Ziqing.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
I don't want to hear it or see it.

147
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,480
I don't know and I don't want to know.

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,760
Tell me where Natasha is.

149
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,290
I've already answered you.

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,040
I'll give you one more chance.

151
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,320
Tell me where Natasha is, or else I'll...

152
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
Or else what?

153
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
Let me tell you something.

154
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,840
We live in a society governed by law now.

155
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
There are cameras everywhere here.

156
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,370
What can you do to me?

157
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,440
Besides,

158
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
even if I knew,

159
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,920
why should I tell you?

160
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,120
Unless...

161
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Don't get any ideas about my sister.

162
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,380
Unless you can help me get rid of Sha Tang.

163
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Sha Tang left yesterday.

164
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Left?

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,280
Auntie, auntie, I want this one.

166
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,410
Auntie, I want this.

167
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,280
Okay, take it, take it.

168
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,160
Put it in, alright.

169
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,080
Mommy, mommy, I want this.

170
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,200
Coming.

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
Okay, okay, okay.

172
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,820
Take it, take it, put it in.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,720
Auntie, auntie.

174
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
I want this one.

175
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,520
Auntie, auntie, I want this one.

176
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,160
Mommy, I want this, I want this.

177
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
Alright, alright, alright.

178
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,440
Take it, take it, take it.

179
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,920
Check out, take it.

180
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
Oh heavens, oh earth!

181
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,920
Which fairy sister was it

182
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,400
who avenged me like this?

183
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
This demon has finally left.

184
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,480
I can't express in words

185
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,280
how excited I am inside.

186
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm speechless.

187
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,080
Right.

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,930
It must be my love for Yueyue

189
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,650
that has moved the heavens.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,260
And touched the earth.

191
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
The final victory will surely be mine.

192
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Are you finished?

193
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,440
Have you expressed everything?

194
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Now, can you tell me

195
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
where I can find Natasha?

196
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
You've fallen in love with Natasha?

197
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,620
What's that got to do with you?

198
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,760
It didn't matter before,

199
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,360
but now it can.

200
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,450
What do you mean?

201
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm a businessman.

202
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
We can cooperate.

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,440
Cooperate?

204
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,540
I've just thought of a win-win solution.

205
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
We're on the same side now.

206
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,540
You help me pursue Yueyue.

207
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,440
I'll help you win over Natasha.

208
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,240
No problem.

209
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,280
First, help me find Natasha.

210
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,520
Hello?

211
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
Teacher Zhao, we're short one person.

212
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,810
Yes, we're missing one.

213
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,720
Jiahao.

214
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,040
Jiahao.

215
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Jiahao.

216
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,120
Jiahao.

217
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Li Jiahao.

218
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,800
Li Jiahao.

219
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,040
Li Jiahao.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Jiahao.

221
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,480
Jiahao.

222
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,200
Li Jiahao.

223
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,160
Li Jiahao.

224
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,280
Jiahao.

225
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Jiahao.

226
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,840
Jiahao.

227
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,360
Mom.
