1
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,080
Look at this.

2
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
What do you call this?

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,680
Look at this one.

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,680
Why does the internet write about everything?

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
She doesn't even take it seriously.

6
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
That's too much.

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,520
Oh my goodness.

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,200
It's chaos out there.

9
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,360
You still have the mood to drink milk here?

10
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,200
You're really calm, aren't you?

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,240
What else can I do?

12
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,680
The innocent have nothing to fear.

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,880
Besides, it's no use for me to worry.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,840
Manyue, tell us, tell us.

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,680
What are these people trying to do?

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,720
Pulling a stunt like this.

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,120
How will you hold your head up in the future?

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,880
Mom, people will say what they want to say.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,160
You can't cover people's mouths to stop them from talking, can you?

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,759
Besides, it hasn't affected my eating.

21
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,520
it hasn't affected my drinking either.

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
it hasn't affected my sleeping either.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,520
Just treat it as watching a show.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,600
Manyue,

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,960
you've just become the ambassador for folk culture promotion.

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,240
And you're also the tourism image spokesperson for Dongji.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
This identity is different from before.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,360
If this matter isn't handled well,

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,540
it's not just your image that will be tarnished.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
Yes, Manyue.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
The Dongji Cultural and Arts Festival.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,320
We've just started promoting our intangible cultural heritage.

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,560
We're at a critical moment right now.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,090
If this isn't handled well,

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,200
all our previous efforts

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
could be wasted.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,680
Manyue's thinking isn't without reason.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,040
Things without substance.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,200
If no one pays attention to them,

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,840
they'll lose interest on their own.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,079
And disperse by themselves.

42
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,240
That's really clear-headed.

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,280
Indeed, when I first saw

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,240
this news,

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
I almost lost it.

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,200
But then I thought,

47
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,560
what should I do? Should I go confront them?

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,079
Wouldn't that mean they've gotten to me?

49
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,960
Wouldn't that be playing into their hands?

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,640
Right?

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,800
Dad, evil can't overcome righteousness.

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
Let the bullets fly for a while.

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
The sun will rise as usual tomorrow.

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
Good night.

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,570
No, sweetheart.

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,680
It's a critical situation now.

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,360
How can you still be in the mood for movie mashups?

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,040
Good night, Maka Baka.

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't worry.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,360
No, she's too carefree.

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,640
Such an important matter.

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,600
What do you think about her?

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,860
Justice will prevail.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,280
Manyue, you're not resting yet?

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,240
Not yet.

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,880
I have something to tell you.

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,760
What a coincidence.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,240
I also have something to tell you.

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,000
You go first.

70
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
You go first.

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
Alright, I'll go first then.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
Manyue,

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,280
I've found that white bear.

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,000
I've been getting closer to it countless times these days.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
Now I'm back to resupply my equipment.

76
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,400
I'll set out early tomorrow morning.

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
This time, I'm sure I can photograph that white bear.

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
My albino project is finally going to be realized.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
Are you happy?

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Congratulations, congratulations.

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,780
So what did you want to tell me?

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,160
I...

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,240
I miss you.

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
I miss you too.

85
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,880
Once I photograph the white bear, I'll come back right away.

86
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,280
I'll take you to Guangxi.

87
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,770
Take care and stay safe.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
Get some rest early.

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,780
Good night.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,680
Good night.

91
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,320
In places you can't see,

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
I'm struggling hard.

93
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,880
I hope when we meet again,

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,600
everything will be settled.

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
Lin Manyue is here, Miss Lin is here.

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,520
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,450
Miss Lin Manyue,

98
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,480
can we have an interview?

99
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,160
Miss Lin, please answer us.

100
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,240
Miss Lin Manyue, please give us an answer.

101
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,720
You're accused of long-term bullying of newcomers.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,850
Please provide a reasonable explanation to the public.

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,180
My stomach is in bad shape.

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,680
It's because I drank beer from the Liangjiang Brewery.

105
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,480
We must be given an explanation.

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,240
I've had diarrhea all night.

107
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
Compensation! Compensation!

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
We've been to the hospital several times.

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
That's right.

110
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
Hello, could you please elaborate?

111
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
Is it food poisoning or excessive heavy metals?

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,200
Are you planning

113
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,120
to seek compensation from Liangjiang Distillery?

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
How many people in total

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,320
have experienced similar symptoms?

116
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,560
Do you need to take collective legal action?

117
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
If Liangjiang Distillery proposes a private settlement,

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,290
would you accept it?

119
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,200
Compensation! Compensation!

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
What's all this noise about?

121
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,960
If there's any problem with this distillery, I'll take full responsibility.

122
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,280
But if there's nothing wrong with the distillery,

123
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,920
come on,

124
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,680
if someone is deliberately slandering us,

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,010
all of this is evidence.

126
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
You like to film?

127
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,240
Come on, if you like filming, then film.

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,260
Go ahead, film.

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,040
No, no, no.

130
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,640
Keep filming, keep filming.

131
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,040
Let's go, let's go.

132
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,920
Film.

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,100
Don't run away, keep filming.

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,880
Lin Manyue.

135
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,960
Only we can save you now.

136
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,080
Zhong Ziqing.

137
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,440
I didn't want to bother with you originally.

138
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,680
You just had to cause trouble, didn't you?

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,320
Fine.

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
let's have a go at it then.

141
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,520
Mom, what's wrong?

142
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,840
Manyue.

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,940
What's this Hezhe Star all about?

144
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,080
Hezhe Star? What does that mean?

145
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,400
You don't know yet?

146
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,050
Hold on, I'll send it to you.

147
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,160
Thank you all for your likes and follows.

148
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,080
I see the people in our livestream room,

149
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,120
it's not a big deal.

150
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,080
More and more people are following.

151
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,880
Did Hezhe Star beat Hezhe Treasure?

152
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
Strongly support Hezhe Star.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,760
Support Qianweina.

154
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Hezhe Treasure's collapse really ruined my impression.

155
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,000
Continue to boycott Liangjiang Beer.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,880
I took one sip of Liangjiang Beer and threw up.

157
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,800
Qianweina still tastes better.

158
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
The fox's tail has finally been revealed.

159
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Zhong Ziqing, you're too impatient.

160
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
Mom and Dad,

161
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,480
This matter is aimed at me.

162
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
So you must be careful when you're out.

163
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,240
you must stay calm.

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,500
Don't let anyone get any leverage on you.

165
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Where's Lin Shanhai?

166
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,050
why hasn't he come back yet?

167
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,159
There are people staking out at our doorstep.

168
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,440
I've chased them all away.

169
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,120
Sister,

170
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,360
one word.

171
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going to smash up Zhong Ziqing's office right now.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,120
Brother,

173
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,240
do you have any evidence

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
to prove this is Zhong Ziqing's doing?

175
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,760
Can we think before we act?

176
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,020
Don't be so impulsive.

177
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,740
Then what do you suggest we do?

178
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,040
I think given Zhong Ziqing's personality,

179
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,400
there's definitely more to come with this matter.

180
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,320
I think the most important thing for us

181
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,040
is to find

182
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
evidence of their smear campaign and rumors.

183
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,600
Alright.

184
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
The task of investigating his whereabouts

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,280
leave it to me.

186
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
What about me?

187
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,920
You just stay put at home and wait for news.

188
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,580
Just don't cause any trouble.

189
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,400
The matter of the winery

190
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,460
will be handled by your mother and me.

191
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,720
Okay.

192
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,640
Alright.

193
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,080
Make sure you handle everything properly this time.

194
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,140
Absolutely, boss.

195
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,720
Last time didn't go well.

196
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,920
Last time was an accident.

197
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
Remember,

198
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,760
make sure you do it right this time.

199
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,820
Don't worry, boss.

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,280
Sister-in-law,

201
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,680
Manyue, you scared me to death.

202
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
Thank you for staking out.

203
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,280
Your mission ends here.

204
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,160
Leave the rest to me.

205
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,840
Why?

206
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
You're Russian,

207
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,240
it's too obvious when you're tailing someone.

208
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,700
Go find Lin Shanhai first.

209
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,200
I'll give you further instructions later.

210
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,880
Brother, you didn't tell us in advance.

211
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,159
Those reporters were arranged by our side.

212
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,440
More than a dozen people with cameras surrounded us.

213
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
Who wouldn't be scared?

214
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
And then Lin Manyue's scream on top of that.

215
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
my legs went weak.

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,580
I'm still shaking now.

217
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,740
The boss has given orders.

218
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,620
From now on, you need to go make a scene every day.

219
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,970
The more people you organize, the better.

220
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
What if we really get caught?

221
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,580
if they test us,

222
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,480
won't we be exposed completely?

223
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,530
I've already prepared something for you.

224
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,280
What's this?

225
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,760
Don't ask too many questions.

226
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,480
Mix it with a large bottle of mineral water.

227
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,720
Take a small sip before you go each time.

228
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,800
The effect

229
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,840
will be more convincing than the real thing.

230
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,200
It won't kill anyone, will it?

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,480
Don't worry, it's not lethal.

232
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
Lin Manyue
