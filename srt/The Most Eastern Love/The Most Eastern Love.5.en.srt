1
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,120
Zhong Ziqing is here.

2
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,039
We've been waiting for you for a while.

3
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,880
What's the matter?

4
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
They didn't say.

5
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,840
They said they'd talk when you got back.

6
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,500
Boss Zhong,

7
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,520
Uncle Lin.

8
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,400
Hello.

9
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,680
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,280
Today,

11
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,560
we've come to pay you a visit.

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
It's a bit abrupt.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
We've prepared a small gift for you.

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,729
You're here to see me about something?

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,880
Let's sit and talk, uncle and auntie.

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,940
Let's sit and talk.

17
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,820
Let's sit and talk.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I've seen

19
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,280
the crisis in our factory,

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,400
and it's truly heartbreaking.

21
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,479
I can't even taste my food.

22
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,440
Like a fishbone stuck in the throat.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,300
Like thorns pricking one's back.

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,820
Boss Zhong,

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
We're all businessmen here.

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,560
Please speak your mind.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,120
Alright.

28
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:56,920
First,

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,960
I'll buy up our unsold beer,

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,720
solving our sales problem.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,360
Second,

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,720
I'll facilitate cooperation with Qianweina,

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
addressing the issue of our factory's outdated equipment.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
This way, you two elders

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,660
won't have to work so hard managing the factory.

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,520
You can enjoy your retirement at home

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,800
and just collect your share of the profits.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
This sounds like a good deal.

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,840
Indeed.

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,920
Tell me your terms.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,320
I have a

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,050
unreasonable request.

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,329
Please go ahead.

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,410
Please let me marry Yueyue.

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
Mr. Zhong, please get up.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,680
Uncle Lin,

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,320
please stand up and speak.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,560
Uncle Lin, if you don't agree today,

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
I won't get up.

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,079
Get up, please.

51
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,440
Alright, alright. Stand up and talk.

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,370
get up and speak.

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,900
Uncle Lin, you've agreed?

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,200
I...

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Dad.

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,800
Mom.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,440
You're too kind, too kind.

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,120
Dad.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,400
Mom.

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,000
You're too kind.

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,320
Boss Zhong,

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,210
about your situation with Yueyue,

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,000
we

64
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,650
have heard some things.

65
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,440
Your sincerity,

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,480
both of us have seen it.

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,560
However,

68
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,920
Uncle Lin, there can't be any 'however.'

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,120
I, old Lin,

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,000
don't have much ability.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,160
I can't compare to the wealth and prestige of your Zhong family.

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,079
but I still have some dignity.

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,740
The distillery isn't doing well now.

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,000
I accept bankruptcy,

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,160
but to find a way out for the factory,

76
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,440
if you want to use my daughter as a bargaining chip,

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,040
that's something I can't do.

78
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,079
You can't do it?

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,000
Take care.

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
Old Lin,

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,320
I came today with

82
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,480
a solution for the distillery.

83
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,680
I have only one request.

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
It's to become a part of your Lin family.

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,410
Judging by this situation,

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,900
there's no room for negotiation.

87
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,840
Take care.

88
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,130
Don't bother seeing me out.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Aren't you going to pick up the coaster?

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
Courtesy.

91
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,170
This is the beer.

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,320
I even went to several supermarkets specifically.

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,040
Now, in the better positions on supermarket shelves,

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,200
it's basically all this brand of beer.

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,920
Our Liangjiang beer has been pushed to the corners.

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,380
You can't find it unless you look carefully.

97
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
It looks pretty good.

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,970
What's the use of looking good?

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
Although it's a newly acquired branch factory,

100
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,660
the quality control is still decent.

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,480
The aroma, color, and taste

102
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
are already ninety-nine percent

103
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,560
close to the original product.

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
Give him a bottle of ours.

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,210
Try this one.

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,580
Should I be honest?

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,659
Never mind, let's not say it then.

108
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,740
Is there a big difference?

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,280
Actually, there's not much difference.

110
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,320
There's just a slight difference in taste.

111
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,180
That's what I thought.

112
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Our Liangjiang beer

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,170
has also been tested by the market.

114
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
Could it be a pricing issue?

115
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,840
They're the same price. What could be the problem?

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,580
Being the same is the problem.

117
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,320
What problem?

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,960
Brand advantage.

119
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,120
Qianweina is an international brand.

120
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,520
their procurement of raw materials,

121
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,040
transportation and sales systems

122
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,600
are all more comprehensive than ours.

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,930
The most critical issue

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
is that they have strong financial backing.

125
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
If we engage in a price war,

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,880
in less than a month,

127
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,200
Liangjiang Distillery will be completely ruined.

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,480
To establish a firm foothold,

129
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,400
there's only one path we can take right now,

130
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,480
and that is to improve our flavor.

131
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
Your drinking capacity is terrifying.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,080
One drop hits the soul.

133
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,560
You just need to keep the record.

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,440
I wasn't planning to drink anyway.

135
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,900
I was pouring for you guys.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
One drop hits the soul.

137
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
You bet.

138
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Baby,

139
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm here.

140
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,800
Baby,

141
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,680
you've come at the perfect time.

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,520
You can provide us with some

143
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,720
female perspective.

144
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,840
Let me introduce you.

145
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,920
This is my friend Natasha, a bartender.

146
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,080
When it comes to drinking, no one is more professional than her.

147
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,760
Natasha,

148
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,320
this is my sister and also my boss,

149
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,960
Manyue.

150
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,600
Hello.

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,440
Hello.

152
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
Natasha, I've transferred the money to you.

153
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,920
Complete the task I've given you as soon as possible.

154
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,360
I must get Yueyue back to my side.

155
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,170
Okay.

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
These are all the craft beers

157
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
we can buy on the market.

158
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,200
We'll taste them one by one,

159
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,160
and based on our preferences,

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,640
rate them from one to three points.

161
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
We'll repeatedly compare and eliminate,

162
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,400
until we're left with the three highest-scoring beers.

163
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,680
This is too crazy!

164
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,320
But it's perfect for someone like me

165
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,800
who loves to try different kinds of alcohol.

166
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,610
Alright, let's start the game!

167
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,220
What do these three wines have in common?

168
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,570
They taste good.

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,100
They're distinctive.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
These wines

171
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,680
are all based on ensuring excellent quality,

172
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,760
with the addition of special locally produced ingredients,

173
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,520
such as fruits and spices.

174
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,640
So our current approach should be

175
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,720
to find ingredients from local specialties.

176
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,640
To create a wine that locals like,

177
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
and that people from other regions like as well.

178
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,900
A wine that we foreigners also enjoy.

179
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,840
The Dongji Cultural Tourism Exhibition

180
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,600
has already started selecting products.

181
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,080
I heard they're planning to purchase ten thousand cases of beer.

182
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
For us,

183
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,799
this is incredibly good news.

184
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,960
If we can seize this opportunity to improve the taste

185
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,559
and secure this big order with our new product,

186
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,760
then Liangjiang Brewery

187
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,960
will definitely turn the tide in our favor.

188
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,420
Only these three are left.

189
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,240
Come on.

190
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,090
Take a sniff.

191
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,180
Let me taste it.

192
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,080
Try it.

193
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,450
Can you taste it?

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,800
The fruit acidity is too strong.

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
What do you think?

196
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Indeed, the fruit acidity is a bit too strong.

197
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,400
Let's move on to the next one.

198
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,290
That's too much.

199
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,160
No good.

200
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,770
Let's try again.

201
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
One drop is all it takes.

202
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,280
Manyue.

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,060
Don't run away.

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,440
You.

205
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,040
Hello, big black bear.

206
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,280
Little Black.

207
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,170
Have you seen Little White?

208
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,680
You don't know Little White?

209
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,960
The big white bear.

210
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,680
You're both bears.

211
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,580
How could you not have seen it?

212
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,570
Tell me quietly.

213
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,040
Why aren't you making a sound? Why aren't you speaking?

214
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
That's rude.

215
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,840
What?

216
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Never seen it.

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
How come you haven't seen it?

218
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,680
You...

219
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,050
You're just talking nonsense.

220
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,500
Have you seen it or not?

221
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,480
Photo.

222
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,720
I took it.

223
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,140
Someone's looking for it.

224
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,460
Tell me where it is.

225
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,080
Your voice is too low.

226
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,160
I can't hear you.

227
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
Say something.

228
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,080
You really get drunk easily, don't you?

229
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,400
You've had too much to drink.

230
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
Let's go home.

231
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,100
Little Black just told me.

232
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,770
Said Little White is sleeping.

233
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,290
Don't you know who Little White is?

234
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,440
It's the big white bear you're looking for.

235
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,380
It's sleeping.

236
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,020
it's sleeping.

237
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,980
it's sleeping.

238
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I'll take you to find it another day.

239
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,490
It's asleep.

240
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,680
Thank you.

241
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,100
But the remaining time...

242
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,020
...is only enough to do one thing.

243
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
To the existing ingredients,

244
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,840
we add cranberry juice,

245
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,160
then use Russian linden honey

246
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,200
to neutralize the tartness.

247
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,060
The initial acidity is quite strong,

248
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,800
like-

249
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,620
Let me taste it.

250
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
Boss, this isn't wine.

251
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
This is vinegar!

252
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
The sourness is right.

253
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,720
Sourness is a characteristic of cranberries.

254
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,880
I think this wine has a unique character.

255
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,600
I agree.

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,400
All addictive things,

257
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
before the first taste,

258
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,920
are not easily accepted.

259
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,720
Like coffee,

260
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,720
or chili peppers.

261
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,650
So I think it will definitely work.

262
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,490
It's the morning mist of the Ussuri River,

263
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,490
the first ray of sunlight in the birch forest.

264
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,460
It can go national,

265
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,280
and even global.

266
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,640
The taste of the Eastern Frontier.
