1
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,160
That's great!

2
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,000
This is truly a double blessing!

3
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,200
How old are you to be so noisy?

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,920
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at by the children?

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,580
I'm just excited, that's all.

6
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,680
They're here.

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,400
Hello, uncle.

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello, uncle and auntie.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,860
Hello, auntie.

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,640
Uncle Lin, we just received

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,160
the notice for the program selection of the Dongji Cultural Arts Festival.

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,800
So we rushed over to ask Manyue

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,520
if there's anything we can help with.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,240
Manyue,

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,479
you haven't been coming to rehearse with us much lately, have you?

16
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,210
You haven't let your basic skills slip, have you?

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,960
Do you think Manyue's foundation

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,200
is made of paper?

19
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,120
The question now is

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,000
which program Manyue wants to perform in.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,930
Let's help her make a good decision

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,759
and aim for the best possible outcome.

23
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,720
Yes, yes, yes.

24
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,000
I know this Dongji Cultural Arts Festival

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
is a very good

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
opportunity to promote our Hezhe culture.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
However,

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,560
the program team only gave us

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,020
time for one performance.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,800
Manyue, don't overthink it.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,400
Cultural promotion

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,760
is a long and gradual process.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,880
No one can get fat in one bite, right?

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,680
That's right.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,079
Don't take all the pressure on yourself.

36
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,640
It makes us three look like we have nothing better to do.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,800
For this event, just choose the program you're most confident in.

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Go with your best performance.

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,200
We'll definitely give you our full support

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
and won't cause any trouble for you.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Right.

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,600
Excuse me for interrupting,

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,440
but this news came so suddenly.

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,079
Why don't we let Manyue think it over carefully?

45
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,160
Yes, Manyue, take your time to consider it.

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
After the program is finalized,

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,640
the three of us will accompany her for rehearsals.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,440
Yes.

49
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,920
Alright, alright.

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Uncle and Auntie, we'll be leaving now.

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
Take care, and good luck!

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Take care, come visit again!

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,360
Bye-bye, bye-bye!

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
Take care, take care!

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,200
Xiao Sha,

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,920
staying in hotels all the time isn't a good solution, you know.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,780
How about this,

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,040
let Manyue

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,960
go back to the hotel with you to pack up your things,

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
and you move back home to stay with us.

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,120
Shanhai and his wife have moved out,

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,450
so we have space at home.

63
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,940
It's settled then.

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
Your mom and I

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
will get the room ready for you soon.

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,460
We'll start preparing it right away.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,480
Rest assured.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
As long as the program our company submits

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
gets approved,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,280
the sponsorship funds will be fully paid immediately.

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,800
You can be even more confident about the quality of the program.

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,079
Do I need to say more about Hezhe Zhibao's capabilities?

73
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,840
As for me,

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,160
the proposal is already written.

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,200
I'll send it to the organizing committee shortly.

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
I won't let you down.

77
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,600
Okay.

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,400
Yueyue.

79
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,840
Just thinking about being on the same stage with you,

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
showcasing our talents,

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,610
I feel incredibly excited inside.

82
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,980
It will be such a beautiful scene.

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,480
Still dreaming, huh?

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
Is it that difficult?

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,280
It's not difficult. You choose one.

86
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,040
I... well, I don't really understand it either.

87
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,080
If you don't understand, then shut up.

88
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,010
Forget about it.

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,600
Come back to the hotel with me to pack up.

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,280
We haven't figured out the important matters yet.

91
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,240
What do you mean, go back to the hotel?

92
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,160
What? What do you mean by important matters?

93
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,320
Isn't me moving in an important matter?

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,640
How is that an important matter?

95
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,570
Then is me looking for Bai Xiong an important matter?

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,610
What do you mean?

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,000
I guess I'm keeping you from finding Bai Xiong, huh?

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's not what I meant.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Then what do you mean?

100
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
What do you mean by what do I mean?

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,130
Are you going or not?

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,159
You're really not going?

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,450
What did you choose?

104
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,659
The Imakan that Bai Xiong likes to listen to.

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
You've got a smart mouth.

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,960
Since you've chosen Imakan,

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
let's practice it well.

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
I'll accompany you in a moment.

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,970
Sounds good.

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,720
Yueyue,

111
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,040
what are you up to now?

112
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,920
Now, let me introduce myself.

113
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,080
I, humble as I am,

114
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,520
am the biggest sponsor

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,120
of this Dongji Cultural and Arts Festival.

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,880
And the project involving Yueyue and me

117
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,360
is the only duo performance.

118
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,560
How come I didn't know about this?

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,620
Well, now you know.

120
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,159
You mean at the Dongji Cultural and Arts Festival,

121
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,680
you want to do a duo performance with me?

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,850
To complement you, Yueyue.

123
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,280
A beautiful flower needs green leaves to set it off.

124
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,440
With my support,

125
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,760
you'll shine like a bright light,

126
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,160
dazzling everyone.

127
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
What will you be performing?

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,040
Since you've brought out your Imakan,

129
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,680
I'll have to bring out my specialty,

130
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,840
tango, to pair with you.

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,280
Yes.

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,720
That's exactly the expression I want.

133
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,880
This is the effect I'm going for.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,040
I want to work hard quietly,

135
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,200
and then surprise everyone.

136
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,240
We are indeed quite surprised.

137
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,680
Right?

138
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,800
But guess what, is there a possibility

139
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
that the performances at this Dongji Cultural and Arts Festival

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,400
need to have some ethnic characteristics?

141
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,240
Ethnic?

142
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,680
Then I can only

143
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,290
dance the Lu Shen dance.

144
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,000
Teacher.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,440
I know you're really good at Lu Shen dance.

146
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
So, you teach me.

147
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,520
You're second only to Yueyue.

148
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,650
Name your price. Just give me a figure.

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,920
You mean...

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,800
Manyue's performance...

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,760
requires two people to participate?

152
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,360
No.

153
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,640
Why are you everywhere?

154
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
This is our arts circle's business.

155
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,600
What does it have to do with you?

156
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,010
Let's make a bet.

157
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,120
Bet on what?

158
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,040
Aren't you learning Lu Shen dance?

159
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,200
I'll learn the mouth harp.

160
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,360
This way, neither of us will interfere with Manyue's rehearsal.

161
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
When it's time for the program selection,

162
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,040
we'll compete against each other for scores.

163
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
Whoever scores higher

164
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,880
will perform with Manyue.

165
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
I agree.

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,450
Just someone who presses the shutter.

167
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,420
What do you have to bet with me?

168
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,280
Master,

169
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,080
Manyue, you truly are the treasure of the Hezhe people.

170
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm so envious of your voice.

171
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,410
Why don't we switch?

172
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,900
Are you okay? You didn't lose any teeth, did you?

173
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,400
Why are you putting in so much effort?

174
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm a bit anxious because I can't make a sound.

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,600
I just want to try a different position.

176
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,130
Is this really that urgent?

177
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,799
The jaw harp has been played

178
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,600
with the same few techniques since ancient times.

179
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,799
You want to innovate?

180
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,520
Teacher, I have talent.

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,130
Look over there.

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,130
The richest man in Fuyuan. Talent.

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,440
Master, let me tell you,

184
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,000
I've already mastered the essence of the Lu Shen dance.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,720
No, no, no.

186
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,320
Don't call me master.

187
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,180
I can't teach a disciple like you.

188
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,360
As long as Yueyue and I work together,

189
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,600
we can definitely promote and develop the Lu Shen dance.

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,480
What a sin!

191
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,120
If my master finds out about this,

192
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,850
he'll expel me from the school.

193
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
Yueyue, Yueyue.

194
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,320
Look, let me tell you,

195
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,320
our teacher can't teach me anymore.

196
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,920
Man Yue.

197
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,940
Exceptionally talented.

198
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,600
Talent.

199
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Yueyue says I have talent.

200
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,280
I understand.

201
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,240
Talent.

202
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,680
You startled me.

203
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,540
I was too absorbed in practicing.

204
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,120
I didn't even notice someone coming in.

205
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,320
So diligent, aren't you?

206
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,760
I was wondering what that noise was next door.

207
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,240
It's so bizarre and chaotic.

208
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,880
The way you're playing...

209
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,640
if you keep playing like this,

210
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,120
you'll wake up my parents.

211
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,800
Well, it's not our fault we're not as talented as others.

212
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
If you're not good, you just have to practice more.

213
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Jealous?

214
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,220
Since that's the case,

215
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,580
I'll give you a little lesson.

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,080
Teacher Lin, please have a seat.

217
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,400
Play it for me once.

218
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Stop.

219
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,560
What's wrong?

220
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,370
Give it to me.

221
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,490
Open your mouth.

222
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Gently bite down.

223
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,120
Open wide.

224
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,640
Gently hold it with your upper and lower teeth.

225
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,800
Relax your lips.

226
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,080
Then use your breath to produce its sound.

227
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,240
Why are your lips so stiff?

228
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,880
Can you relax?

229
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,920
Can you relax? Can you?

230
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,920
can you relax?

231
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,160
Open your mouth, gently hold it.

232
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,640
Yes, yes, that's the feeling.

233
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,040
You try it.

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
How clumsy.

235
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,320
It's set up.

236
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
I'll teach you step by step.

237
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,570
put it in your mouth.

238
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
relax your mouth.

239
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
give me your hand.

240
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,520
Let's learn this position first.

241
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,440
this hand gesture.

242
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
Use this part of your index finger to pluck.

243
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,880
Gently, gently.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,800
One, two.

245
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,420
Have you got the feel of it?

246
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,820
That's right, keep going.

247
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,960
Yes, that's the feeling.

248
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,820
It's not my first time teaching someone.

249
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
but it's my first time...

250
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,180
Accompanied by the sound of the jaw harp,

251
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I hear the sound of my own heartbeat.

252
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,410
For the sake of standing beside me,

253
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,960
his clumsy yet earnest demeanor

254
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,320
makes me at this moment

255
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,280
incredibly smitten.
