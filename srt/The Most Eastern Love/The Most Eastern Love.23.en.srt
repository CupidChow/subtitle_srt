1
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,840
Zhong Ziqing's few punches and kicks

2
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,700
were enough to get through to him.

3
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,200
Actually, I think

4
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,360
he had already figured it out himself.

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
He just didn't want to face reality.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,500
What about you?

7
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,039
After I heard the news,

8
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,210
I rushed back immediately.

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,039
But when I arrived, I found out

10
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,300
you had already resolved the situation.

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,960
Since I'm back, I...

12
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,620
That's not what I meant to ask.

13
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,840
Xiao Jiahao's father,

14
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,479
I mean, her real father,

15
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,840
he was also very angry when he found out about this.

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,400
So...

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,460
That's not what I meant to ask either.

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,800
I only found out later

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
that day when you called,

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
you were going to tell me about this.

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,820
I'm sorry, Manyue.

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,090
I came back too late.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
Did you find that bear?

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,000
No.

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,500
Are you still going to look for it?

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,079
Yes.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
So you're actually

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,540
someone who truly yearns for freedom in your heart.

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,490
During the time I've known you,

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,130
I've also come to know myself anew.

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,700
That day at the wedding venue,

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,210
as I walked towards you,

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,840
I realized

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,960
I like flowers,

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,210
I like lively atmospheres,

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,300
I like candlelit dinners for two,

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,180
I like a sense of ceremony.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,700
Because that silhouette was you.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
But all along,

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,400
I've only seen your back.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,370
I'm an ordinary person.

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,300
We don't belong to the same world.

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,800
Go find your bear.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
I sincerely hope you can find that bear.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,760
I also hope that this time when you leave,

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,220
you won't come back again.

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Get out of the car.

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,680
If the life I want

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,740
would become a constraint for both of us,

50
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,820
perhaps letting go

51
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
is also a way of fulfillment.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,839
Sha Tang,

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,360
thank you for once showing me

54
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,130
a new world of greater freedom.

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
But this is as far as we can go.

56
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,720
Will this be the last time

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
I see your back?

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
Xiao Sha is really something,

59
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,480
such a blockhead.

60
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,240
Exactly.

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,560
When he came to see me this afternoon,

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
he had such a pitiful look on his face.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,600
If it weren't for my boss's sake,

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
I would have wanted to punch him.

65
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,800
Calm down for a bit.

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
If you ask me,

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,640
the fact that Xiao Sha can persist in photographing

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,900
animals with albinism

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
shows that

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,760
he's someone who sees things through

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,000
and has a sense of social responsibility.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,320
Manyue, so...

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,960
Dad,

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,320
you can't be won over by Sha Tang just because

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,040
he brought a big order to our family's winery.

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,120
You can't let him buy you off like that.

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,720
When it comes to matters of right and wrong,

78
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,760
our family needs to present a united front

79
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,680
and firmly stand on my boss's side.

80
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,720
I'm just worried that Manyue might make an impulsive decision

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,800
and make a choice

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,160
that she'll regret later when it's too late.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,960
Shanhai,

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,040
give Sha Tang a call and ask him to come over.

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,120
I'd like to ask him face to face

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,240
if my daughter means less to him

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,400
than a white-furred bear.

88
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
What's the use of calling?

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,159
I can just drag him over here, can't I?

90
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,120
Enough.

91
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,260
I was the one who told him to leave.

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,520
He has his own dreams.

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,920
Why should I keep him confined here with me?

94
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,240
I remember the first time

95
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,280
he told me about the albino map,

96
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,520
there was a light in his eyes.

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
It was as hot as the sun.

98
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,440
But in reality, my presence

99
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,160
has been holding him back all along.

100
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,120
As time goes by,

101
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,450
will that light still be there?

102
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,200
Let him go.

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Don't mention him again from now on.

104
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,900
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

105
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,320
The only one who can help them now

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,040
is probably God.

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,159
You must be the photographer, Sha Tang.

108
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,360
You are

109
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,520
Lin Manyue, the treasure of the Hezhe people.

110
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,240
Keep going, young man.

111
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,680
Brave bear-seeking youth.

112
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Come on.

113
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,360
Let me see your determination to find the bear.

114
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,290
Have you seen it?

115
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I took this photo.

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,180
Someone is looking for it.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,810
I think you're pretty cool now.

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,960
Sha Tang,

119
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,440
I will definitely help you find the polar bear.

120
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,440
Boss.

121
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,200
Has Sha... Sha... Shatang left?

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I suppose so.

123
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,360
I'm going to the winery.

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,620
The polar bear is back.

125
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
In Fuyuan.

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
Why would the polar bear be here at this time?

127
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,159
Back to Dongji.

128
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,120
I can't worry about all that now.

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,159
Since it's back,

130
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,970
I must capture it on camera.

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,280
How is it? Does it look stylish?

132
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,920
Folks, click on the shopping cart below.

133
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,560
It's not 199.

134
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
Today, it's only 99.

135
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,720
Take it home for just 99!

136
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,200
What a great coat, folks!

137
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
A Hezhe treasure!

138
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,840
Look here, everyone!

139
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,600
A Hezhe treasure! A Hezhe treasure!

140
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Let me show it to everyone in the livestream.

141
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,320
A Hezhe treasure!

142
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,240
Don't go!

143
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,240
Don't leave!

144
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,880
How embarrassing. It's a big misunderstanding.

145
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,680
Where on earth is the polar bear?

146
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,800
Did you see it? Did you see it?

147
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,080
Is this the same one as before?

148
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,400
The first ray of sunlight captured that polar bear.

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,280
It's amazing.

150
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,210
I can't believe I'm seeing it here.

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,360
They say bears are timid and afraid of people.

152
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,240
It must be that it can't find food in this icy wilderness.

153
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,840
It's desperate with hunger.

154
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,490
Excuse me, is this the Dongji Fish Market?

155
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,300
Yes, yes, that's the Dongji Fish Market.

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,560
Dongji Fish Market.

157
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,640
Brother,

158
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
are you here to buy fish?

159
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,140
No, I'd like to ask you something.

160
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Someone just photographed a polar bear here.

161
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,400
Did you see it?

162
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,320
Here.

163
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,640
Yes.

164
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,500
There's a bear.

165
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,680
Yes, look.

166
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,760
It was photographed over there, right?

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,800
Yes, yes.

168
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
That's nonsense.

169
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
Impossible.

170
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,040
If there were a bear here,

171
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,040
everyone in the fish market would have run away by now.

172
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,260
The bear is coming!

173
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
The bear is coming!

174
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,880
In broad daylight,

175
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,960
A polar bear has entered the city. Look!

176
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,640
It can't be real.

177
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,920
How could this be fake?

178
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,720
Look, there's even video footage.

179
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,850
It's already entered the Fish Museum.

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,730
A polar bear in the Fish Museum.

181
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,560
Dangerous.

182
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,560
Help! Someone's kidnapping a child!

183
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,320
What are you doing?

184
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,640
Where are you taking our child?

185
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
You didn't mention this was going to happen.

186
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,000
What if the child gets scared and something happens?

187
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,320
I finally convinced the child to take a photo with the bear,

188
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,400
and you've ruined it all.

189
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,160
That bear...

190
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,240
I'm sorry, it's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

191
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,100
Go ahead, take the photo, take it.

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,330
What a day this has been.

193
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,620
Aren't you charging people anymore?

194
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,880
Charge them.

195
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,240
Zhong Ziqing.

196
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,200
Is Zhong Ziqing crazy or what?

197
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,160
Did you do this?

198
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,720
You're the one who's crazy.

199
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,480
I'm watching Xiao Wan rehearse.

200
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,280
What the hell?

201
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Attention, attention. Important announcement.

202
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,600

216
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
Thank you. I'd like to ask something.

217
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,520
This envelope,

218
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,980
is it only available here?

219
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,480

220
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,340
exclusive commemorative stamp.

221
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,640
Thank you.

222
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,680
Um, I'd like to ask something else.

223
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,640
Has there been

224
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,400
anyone unusual here today?

225
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
Anyone unusual?

226
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,800
If I told you

227
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
a bear just came by, would you believe me?

228
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,760
When?

229
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,880
Just before you came in.
