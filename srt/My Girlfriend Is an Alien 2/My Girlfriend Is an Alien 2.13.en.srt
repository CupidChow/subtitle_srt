=My Girlfriend is an Alien S2=

19
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,010
Every couple has a matchmaker

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,440
who helps them in silence.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,720
Recently, there have
been a lot of bad reviews

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
that maliciously smear our company.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,410
So I hope that our company can now

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,360
set up

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,130
a research department
of our own immediately.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,440
People and matters on
this planet are really complicated.

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,800
They said it wasn't your fault

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,570
because they wanted to
take the pressure off you.

29
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,800
They didn't expect you
to feel more guilty.

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,210
I have a friend.

31
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,490
He was

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,720
kissed by a girl.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,160
If the girl who kissed your friend

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,800
suddenly turned aloof,

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,320
she must be playing hard to get.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Children on Earth

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,490
come into the world

38
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,800
through their mothers.

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,720
Mothers are for them

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
the bridge connecting them to the world.

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,290
Don't think you're alone.

42
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,370
You still have me.

43
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,760
If someone suddenly kisses you,

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,880
it means he's been intending to do it.

45
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,720
When you

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,530
like someone for the first time,

47
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,760
you subconsciously deny it.

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
It's called self-deception.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,850
Is your mood any better?

50
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,290
I was always in a good mood.

51
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,810
But ever since I met Fang Leng,

52
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,200
I've been having trouble.

How was it, Xiaoqi?

59
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,810
What did Fang Leng say?

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm sorry, Chai.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,690
I couldn't convince him.

62
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,690
We might still have to move.

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
It's okay.

64
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,250
I already expected that.

65
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,690
It was pointless to go to him.

66
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,880
It's time to let go.

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,090
Never mind.

68
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,440
Tomorrow morning,

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,570
I'll go house hunting.

70
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Chai.

71
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,920
- I...
- Chai.

72
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,530
I have searched online.

73
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,880
there are plenty of houses that can

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
accommodate the three of us.

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Really?

76
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,880
Great! Let me see.

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,320
However, we can't afford it.

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,760
It's...

79
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,200
Xiaoqi.

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,130
Shall we just go and buy a tent

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,720
and live on the streets?

82
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,760
No way!

83
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,720
You have me.

84
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,850
I will never let you two babies

85
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,160
roam the streets.

86
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,370
Fret not!

87
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,370
Chai.

88
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,850
What do you think?

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,010
Isn't it nice here, too?

90
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,200
By the way, I have a good idea.

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,880
Currently, our milk tea shop is

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,610
open only until 9.30pm.

93
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,080
If we stay here,

94
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,690
we can operate until midnight.

95
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,610
This way,

96
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,810
we can save on rent

97
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,010
and increase our turnover.

98
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,690
It's killing two birds with one stone.

99
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,400
Oh, my god!

100
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,810
Don't be afraid.

101
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,440
I'm terrified of cockroaches.

102
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,840
- Oh, my god.
- I'll take it outside.

103
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,010
It's all right.

104
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,050
There.

105
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,050
It's all right.

106
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm sorry, Chai.

107
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,960
I put you into trouble to live here.

108
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,250
It's okay.

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,690
We are a family now. Don't be sorry.

110
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
So

111
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,370
the most important thing now
is to make more money.

112
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,730
As soon as we make enough money,

113
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,080
we can move out

114
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,810
and live in a better house.

115
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,520
You're right.

116
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,960
Let's pull ourselves together.

117
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,440
Yes.

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,170
Fighting!

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,010
Fighting!

120
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,730
Tomorrow will be another good day.

121
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,610
Fighting!

122
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,170
Pretending to be strong

123
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,880
is the norm for earthlings.

124
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,200
Now that is

125
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,640
the true state.

126
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,400
If only someone could comfort Chai.

127
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,730
You're right.

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,200
You're finally here.

129
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Come here. Quick.

130
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,130
How is Chai?

131
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,050
She's inside.

132
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,810
Wait a minute.

133
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,760
Hey.

134
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,010
- You told me on the phone...
- Xiaobu.

135
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,250
Please clean it up for me.

136
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,170
Okay.

137
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,570
What brings you here?

138
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,640
- I...
- Yes, Dr. Zhang.

139
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,810
What a coincidence.

140
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,960
I remember I have work to do.

141
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,730
- Wait. You...
- Excuse me.

142
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,200
Sorry.

143
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,960
Xiaobu.

144
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,880
Why are you dragging me along?

145
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,280
Yes. I'm busy, too.

146
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,880
- Anyway, we are very busy.
- Yes.

147
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,010
We'll leave you be.

148
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,440
Hello.

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Forget it.

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,840
There is no point

151
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,810
telling you all this.

152
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,570
All these years,

153
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,170
I've read so many romance novels.

154
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,960
Still, I couldn't keep my first love.

155
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,570
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

156
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,810
No.

157
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,610
Then why do you think

158
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,170
Yunhai made me wait for him for so long?

159
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,280
Is he testing me?

160
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,640
So

161
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
did you really not get it?

162
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,570
What do you mean?

163
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,080
The last time you saw him,

164
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,880
he told you he was tired,

165
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,370
under a lot of pressure,

166
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,640
needed a little private space

167
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,050
and even told you

168
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,610
he needed to be alone for a while.

169
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,010
Wasn't that meant that
he wanted to break up with you?

170
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,250
Break up?

171
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,200
No way.

172
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,690
If so, shouldn't he have said,

173
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,570
"You're a nice girl,

174
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,320
but we're not right for each other.

175
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,690
Let's just be friends."

176
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,400
Then he would block me on WeChat.

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,760
That is women's way of saying breakup.

178
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,490
For a man,

179
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,200
if he says he's tired,

180
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,170
he's breaking up with you.

181
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,880
Why do you have to
rub salt into my wounds?

182
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,810
I've been comforting
myself all these years.

183
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,640
Do you need to tell me this?

184
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,690
Other psychiatrists
ease people's worries,

185
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,960
but you, on the other hand,

186
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,250
adding weight on their shoulders.

187
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,690
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

188
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,010
Maybe I was too blunt.

189
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,010
Do you have a public profile?

190
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,960
Yes.

191
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,440
Which one?

192
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,250
This one.

193
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,730
I'm going to give you a bad review!

194
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,010
As long as you keep going,

195
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,250
Fang Leng will be
impressed by your efforts.

196
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,250
Good morning.

197
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,250
Good morning.

198
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,090
Good morning, Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang...

199
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,010
What is he thinking now?

200
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,850
Ms. Chai.

201
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,370
Mr. Fang said if I help you again,

202
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,730
he will fire me, too.

203
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,730
Take care.

204
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,610
Xiaoqi.

205
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,800
You're on your own now.

206
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,250
When will the data
on new products be ready

207
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,160
It has been handed over
to the marketing department.

208
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,450
By the end of the day at the latest.

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,300
(Mr. Zhou)

210
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,520
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

211
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,490
Hello, Mr. Fang.

212
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,490
I have good news for you.

213
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,560
My sister is back in the country.

214
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,880
She is particularly
interested in Future Group.

215
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,850
Really?

216
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,280
Then I will visit your sister in person

217
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,800
someday when she is free.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,920
Mr. Zhou's sister?

219
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,970
So she's the number one
female investor on Wall Street.

220
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,160
No more delay.

221
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,610
You can come to
our family lunch tomorrow.

222
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,970
My sister asked me to invite you.

223
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,330
Okay, I'll be there.

224
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,850
All right. See you tomorrow.

225
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,370
Mr. Fang.

226
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,560
The first batch of grants

227
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,800
has come through.

228
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
(Chai Xiaoqi, perfumer
Han Renjie, perfumer)

229
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,400
Mr. Fang.

230
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,090
Although the first grants
are relatively small,

231
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,250
but at last

232
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,920
we can officially start
the research on pheromone perfumes.

233
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,250
Such a good project

234
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,040
- should be pushed forward quickly.
- Leave it aside first.

235
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,210
Follow up on other projects.

236
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,240
(Work hard)

237
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,010
What else is there?

238
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,040
What else can I do?

239
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,560
Why are you sighing too, Assistant Han?

240
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,330
Pheromone perfume is
such a good project,

241
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,130
but Mr. Fang doesn't
seem to be interested in it.

242
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,330
Why?

243
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,450
A man without money

244
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,920
is no man at all.

245
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,370
Mr. Fang is worried that the follow-up
funding will not be forthcoming

246
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,850
and that this will delay the project.

247
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,330
Mr. Fang has been worrying a lot

248
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,640
about the investment.

249
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,130
I wish I could pull in investment.

250
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,330
Pull in investment?

251
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,100
(Get funding)

252
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,520
Thanks, Assistant Han.

253
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,090
You gave me an idea.

254
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,250
Did I?

255
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
I'm coming in.

256
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,520
I've found a great investment

257
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,130
for you online.

258
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,610
It was not easy to find.

259
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
It only takes an hour
to get to your account.

260
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,640
No collateral.

261
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,340
(Manual of procedures regarding
loans secured against nude photos)

262
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,160
Great, right?

263
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,400
(Rules for high-interest loans)
Impressive, isn't it?

264
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,920
Here.

265
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,210
Smile.

266
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,450
It's office hours.

267
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,850
What are you trying to pull?

268
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,280
Handsome.

269
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,920
Fang Leng.

270
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,760
Fang Leng, I found another way.

271
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,640
Check this out.

272
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,760
I met a rich second generation.

273
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,330
The owner is very wealthy.

274
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,250
Look.

275
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:18,970
You...

276
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,330
So? Isn't this rich lady
super generous?

277
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
(Missing dog, with great reward)

278
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,090
Return it back.

279
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,970
Why?

280
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,560
It's adorable.

281
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,610
And its owner is very generous.

282
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,010
Fang Leng.

283
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,330
Fang Leng.

284
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,400
I have another way.

285
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,090
Hold this.

286
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,290
(Raise the box)

287
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,970
(A little love from each one,)
I know the power of the masses is great.

288

As the saying goes,

289

My time is precious.

294

I don't have time
to fool around with you.

295

(A little love from each one,
the world will become better.)

297
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,090
I did a good job at this.

298
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,560
Beautiful people,

299
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,490
please show some love.

301
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,130
Is this university famous?

302
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,970
It is the number one

university in the world

and employment rate.

306
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,880
Impressive.

307
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,640
By the way,

308
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,920
I've prepared
the admission letter for you.

309
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,640
You are amazing, Xiaobu.

310
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,680
You flatter me.

311
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,130
Thank you.

Hurry up.

Why am I turning into a turtle again?

What's going on here?

319
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,090
You were on
a hunger strike for your dream.

320

Why are you pretending to cry now?

321
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,160
Mum.

322
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,490
I'm in tears because of my studies.

323
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,160
I've thought it through.

324
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,560
I used to be

325
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,850
too willful and childish.

326
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,610
Now I know

327
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,760
that learning can make me happy.

328
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,090
If I had known it,

329
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,450
I should have studied in America

330
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,280
and get myself ready
to take over the company

331
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,450
instead of coming back to do art.

332
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,130
My son.

333
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,760
Have you really thought it through?

334
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,800
Mum.

335
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,330
Look.

336
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,680
I have received the admission letter.

337
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,040
Thinking that

338
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,490
I'm still at home
and missing out on my studies

339
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,640
makes me want to
rush over there right now.

340
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Hold on.

341
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,210
Why is this a local university?

342
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,280
You should have applied
Ivy League University in the US.

343
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,560
You're wrong to think that way.

344
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,560
Why do you fancy
the foreign universities?

345
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,610
I chose a local university

346
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,680
because I want to
take over the family business.

347
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,680
Isn't that more convenient?

348
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,850
What do you think?

349
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,730
Is this university famous?

350
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,010
Let me tell you.

351
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,640
It is the number one
university in the world

352
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,160
in terms of teaching staff
and employment rate.

353
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,970
Really?

354
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,850
How come I've never heard of it?

355
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,560
Mum.

356
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,730
How can someone as smart as me

357
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,160
go to an average university?

358
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,920
They only recruit

359
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,040
geniuses or prodigies.

360
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,640
Most people don't know
about this university.

361
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,450
Okay, fine.

362
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,560
Son.

363
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,640
As long as you stop doing arts

364
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,760
and give up your dream
of becoming an artist,

365
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,090
I will support you.

366
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,210
Okay.

367
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,920
I'll tell your dad the good news.

368
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,280
Good boy.

369
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,680
- I'll get going.
- Mum.

370
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,760
Bye.

371
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,040
Xiaobu.

372
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,370
Xiaobu.

373
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,040
Xiaobu.

374
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,020
(Closed)

375
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,040
Why is it so difficult
to pull in investment?

376
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,680
It has to be legal.
I can't seek sympathy

377
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,330
nor rely on bounties.

378
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,520
The boss is too demanding.

379
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,250
Xiaoqi.

380
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,280
Why isn't Xiaobu back yet?

381
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,680
I don't know where she went either.

382
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,560
Chai.

383
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,920
How did your conversation
with that Dr. Zhang go?

384
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,160
It was perfect.

385
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,210
He's a very sweet man,

386
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,920
very attentive, has high empathy

387
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,850
and a good listener.

388
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
I almost gave him a five-star review.

389
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,130
Really?

390
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,160
Okay, I'm done talking.

391
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,280
I'm off to get my beauty sleep.

392
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,890
Goodnight.

393
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,010
That's a relief.

394
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,520
He's a professional indeed.

395
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:19,970
Not bad.

396
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,800
Xiaoqi.

397
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,840
Xiaoqi.

398
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,210
Why did you turn into a turtle again?

399
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,730
Stop asking.

400
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,840
Find a way to cool me down.

401
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,490
Okay.

402
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,650
Why did you turn into a turtle again?

403
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,410
Xiaoqi.

404
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,890
Touch my head.

405
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,650
What's wrong?

406
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,450
This is odd.

407
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,490
I'm totally fine,

408
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,040
but why did I turn into a turtle

409
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,360
when Fang Lie touched my head?

410
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,930
Is that so?

411
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,280
Let me think.

412
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,690
Did your temperature rise,

413
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,080
your face turn red,

414
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
your heart beat faster

415
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,890
and your pupils dilate

416
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,970
when he touched your head?

417
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,970
Did you feel current
throughout your body

418
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,080
and a tingling sensation

419
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,280
when he touched your head?

420
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
Exactly!

421
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,690
I know.

422
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,600
Your head was cracked.

423
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,210
Didn't you tell me

424
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,360
that he was banging you on the head

425
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
the first time he saw you?

426
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,040
That was probably the time

427
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
you cracked the central processing unit

428
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,970
in your head.

429
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,730
That explains why
the system in your head

430
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,010
will automatically activate turtle mode

431
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,360
whenever he touches your head.

432
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
No wonder I felt lightheaded.

433
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,520
When I came to Earth, I got smart.

434
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,040
No wonder I'm getting dumber.

435
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Turns out my central
processing unit was broken.

436
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,010
Go and take a rest. Let's go.

437
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,170
By the way, how are you
and Fang Leng going?

438
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,840
He'll never find
a girlfriend with that temper.

439
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040
I don't have to worry
about having a rival.

440
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,450
I'll take my time.

441
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,520
Welcome. Come on in.

442
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,560
You didn't expect me
to see me here, did you?

443
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,080
I had no choice. My mother
insisted that I come along.

444
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,250
By the way, Uncle Fang
and the others are here.

445
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:20,970
Let's head inside.

446
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,650
Okay.

447
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,800
Fang Leng is running
the company for you.

448
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,730
You can just relax
and enjoy your life.

449
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,280
He has little experience.

450
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,840
He still needs your support.

451
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,410
Actually, my son, Fang Lie...

452
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,280
I'm sorry

453
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,650
for being late.

454
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,410
You arrived just
in the nick of the time.

455
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,320
We were talking about you.

456
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,280
Come on. Take a seat.

457
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,320
Take this away.

458
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,210
Sit down.

459
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,840
Okay.

460
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,120
Here.

461
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,800
I just told them

462
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,560
that you are very forward
thinking in running your company

463
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,890
and you're always
one step ahead of others

464
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,080
in spotting market potential.

465
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,930
You flatter me.

466
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,280
In fact, the domestic beauty market

467
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,560
is now quite mature.

468
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,560
If we want to be accepted
by the customers,

469
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,560
we need something different.

470
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,210
I heard that you had set up
a special research department

471
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,890
for the company's beauty line.

472
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,890
Aren't you worried about
the high upfront investment

473
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,970
and the impact on
profitability later on?

474
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,520
In fact, we set up
the research department

475
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,080
to achieve a complementary role,

476
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,320
mainly to gain consumer acceptance

477
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,450
of our products in the marketplace.

478
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,450
Whether the research department
can make a quick return,

479
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,490
I think it's just a matter of time

480
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,250
before it becomes profitable.

481
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,080
You're a bit bold,

482
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,690
but you've got a great vision.

483
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,970
I was hoping that Mengfei
would study finance

484
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,210
so I could pass the company to her.

485
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,650
Little did I know

486
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,600
that she had no interest

487
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,210
and talent in doing business at all.

488
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,080
Mum.

489
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,600
Why are you mentioning this again?

490
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,250
I think your mother is right.

491
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,120
Being a celebrity is not promising.

492
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,120
You'll have to stay at home eventually.

493
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,450
I think it's more important to find

494
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,970
the right person to take care of you.

495
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,760
Exactly.

496
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,520
I guess you can't just

497
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,560
learn about finance in school.

498
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
You have to talk to people

499
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,970
who have been in business before you.

500
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,600
If I'd known,

501
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,210
I'd have brought Fang Lie along today.

502
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,010
He's still young. He should study more.

503
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,170
He's not young anymore.

504
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,280
In a couple of years, he can
help out in the company.

505
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,690
When the time comes,

506
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,840
please take care of him.

507
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,010
Let's drink.

508
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,410
Cheers.

509
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,360
Cheers.

510
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,970
By the way,

511
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,520
we're having

512
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,490
a business reception tomorrow night,

513
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,650
come and join us

514
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,730
(Invitation)
if you're free.

515
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,930
I have a meeting tomorrow.

516
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
(Invitation)

517
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,930
Mengfei reserved it for you herself.

518
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,250
Don't turn her down.

519
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,410
Besides,

520
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,490
the research department

521
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,890
will need more investment in the future.

522
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,800
So think of it as a way
to meet more people

523
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,360
and expand your network.

524
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,120
Yes, that's it.

525
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,690
Come on. Let's eat while we chat.

526
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,490
Sister, don't worry.

527
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,450
Mr. Zhou and the others

528
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,250
probably not familiar with Fang Leng.

529
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,450
So they were

530
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,010
a bit courteous.

531
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,010
But they didn't have to say such things.

532
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,170
Also, Chen Mengfei's gaze

533
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,600
never left Fang Leng

534
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,930
as soon as he arrived.

535
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,250
If the two of them really get together,

536
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,730
it will be

537
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,760
a great advantage for Fang Leng.

538
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,600
Then

539
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,490
Fang Lie will really have no hope.

540
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,320
By the way,

541
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,930
there's Chai Xiaoqi.

542
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Why do you mention her now?

543
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,890
What do you mean?

544
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,040
I heard from the staff

545
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,760
that Chai Xiaoqi and Fang Leng

546
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,170
are having an ambiguous relationship.

547
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,650
All we have to do

548
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,600
is help Chai Xiaoqi

549
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,080
to take Fang Leng down.

550
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,840
Two cups of milk tea.

551
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,600
Three boxes of cakes.

552
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,690
- Thank you.
- You have

553
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,450
the biggest sweet tooth I've ever met.

554
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,650
Okay.

555
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,600
Mission accomplished. I'll be on my way.

556
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,360
Bye.

557
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,120
Xiaoqi.

558
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,570
(Invitation)

559
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,690
Invitation card?

560
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,840
There is a business reception tomorrow.

561
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,170
We are friends.

562
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,490
So I want you to go with me tomorrow.

563
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,890
Tomorrow?

564
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,760
I have to do delivery for Chai tomorrow.

565
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,360
I might not be able to make it. Sorry.

566
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,280
It's okay.

567
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,170
Next time then.

568
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,560
Too bad.

569
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,320
What do you mean?

570
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,800
I thought you want to get
investment for Research Department.

571
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,560
Tomorrow, there will be...

572
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,520
Didn't you say we were friends?

573
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,800
I can't let you go to the party alone,

574
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,520
can I?

575
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,560
That will be so cruel.

576
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,760
I'll be there on time tomorrow.

577
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,450
Bye.

578
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,040
Bye.

579
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,210
See you tomorrow.

580
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,600
Chai.

581
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,010
Why is there no customer outside?

582
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,280
She cleared the place again.

583
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,120
Why are you here again?

584
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,410
You're almost running out
of the RMB100,000, aren't you?

585
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,930
How did you know?

586
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,210
Are you going to give me more money

587
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,890
because you think
I don't have enough to spend?

588
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,490
How dare you ask me for money?

589
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,120
I asked you to keep me
informed of Fang Leng's every move,

590
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,080
yet

591
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,800
you gave me all sorts of nonsense.

592
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,520
You know how he works.

593
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,280
- He won't let others interfere.
- Stop.

594
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,250
Enough about that.

595
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,360
Let's get to business.

596
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,650
(Invitation)
Fang Leng is going to the reception tomorrow.

597
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Dress up for me.

598
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,730
Impress Fang Leng.

599
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,520
But...

600
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,840
No way.

601
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
I can't do this.

602
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
What do you mean?

603
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,170
No, you see, I usually

604
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,120
dress like this.
I don't know how to doll up,

605
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,080
let alone dressing you up.

606
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,970
And I think this colour

607
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,450
doesn't suit you.

608
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,520
I'm not asking you to dress me up.

609
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,970
I mean you yourself.

610
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,360
Me?

611
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,890
I'm going to get investment anyway

612
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,690
and I have to get
Fang Leng to forgive me.

613
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,080
So I definitely have to look good.

614
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,690
I'm good at this anyway.

615
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,450
Tomorrow's tactic against Fang Leng is

616
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,760
to charm him

617
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,450
with dangerous beauty.

618
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,210
Got it.

619
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,280
Mr. Fang.

620
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,210
Where's Ms. Chai?

621
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,560
I mean,

622
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,650
your bow tie is a little crooked.

623
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,040
Okay.

624
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,740
(Chen Mengfei: Are you here? I'm ready.)

625
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,730
Let's go.

626
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,730
So refreshing.

627
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,800
(Company profile)

628
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Xiaoqi.

629
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,490
How many times have you written this?

630
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,690
Aren't you tired?

631
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,520
I just have some new ideas

632
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,490
to add to the list.

633
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,040
(Collaboration proposal)

634
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,320
This will

635
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,970
certainly help him

636
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,760
to promote the pheromone perfume.

637
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,050
(Analysis of market data)

638
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,840
And see,

639
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,280
I dressed so beautifully today.

640
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,080
I can help him with the investment,

641
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,040
then he will forgive me.

642
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,490
That seems to make sense.

643
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,490
Xiaoqi.

644
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,970
You are brilliant!

645
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,170
Okay, done.

646
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,930
Xiaobu.

647
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,040
Wish me luck.

648
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,930
Fighting!

649
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,650
Hello. This way, please.

650
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,760
Welcome.

651
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,060
(Magnificent Night, Dance With Me)

652
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,120
Excuse me.

653
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,930
You're here.

654
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,080
Thank you.

655
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,560
Let's go.

656
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,210
Hold on.

657
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,730
Have you never been to a reception?

658
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,560
At the reception,

659
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,490
ladies will hold their partner's
arm to enter the venue.

660
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,890
This is what Fang Leng told me.

661
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,120
- Thank you.
- This way, please.

662
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,360
Wait.

663
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:25,970
See this?

664
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,280
Isn't that...

665
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,360
I saw you dropped it
at the last reception.

666
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,690
- So I picked it up.
- Good evening, sir.

667
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,360
Here, put it on.

668
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,210
Okay, thank you.

669
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,650
Isn't that the girl from last time?

670
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,250
Who is that next to her?

671
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,840
Let's go.

672
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,080
- Let's go over there.
- Okay.

673

Mr. Jiang.

- Long time no see.

Chai Xiaoqi from Future Group.

Nice to meet you.

Hello.

683
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,800
Are you a couple?

684
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,040
No wonder you look good together.

685
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
That's not it, Mr. Li.

686
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
We are just friends, not a couple.

687
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,010
We are friends.

688
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,760
You're here.

689
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,410
Hello.

690
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,410
- So...
- Long time no see.

691
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,690
I'll leave you be.

692
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,120
I'll go and get some food.

693
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,320
Okay.

694
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,210
Excuse me.

695
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:52,890
Fang Leng.

696
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,450
Fang Leng.

697
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,760
Hi, we meet again.

698
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,120
You look very good today.

699
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,280
Thanks. You, too.

700
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,490
Fang Leng. What do you think?

701
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,650
Did I fascinate you today?

702
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,080
You came with someone else.

703
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,650
What's the point?

704
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,930
I just met Mr. Li.

705
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,080
There are so many wealthy people here.

706
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,010
We can get investment for sure.

707
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:18,760
Mengfei.

708
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,930
Nana.

709
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,040
Mengfei.

710
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,690
Long time no see.

711
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,560
Hello.

712
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,120
- Hello.
- Please bear with me

713
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,360
if there is any inconvenience today.

714
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,450
This is Mr. Fang you've
been talking about, right?

715
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,080
Yes.

716
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
You're so young.

717
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,800
What a talented young man.

718
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,970
Hello, I'm Fang Leng.

719
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,120
Hello.

720
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

721
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,320
Mr. Fang is not only
successful in his career,

722
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,250
he is also good-looking.

723
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,930
You see, he's a perfect match

724
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,280
for Mengfei.

725
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,890
Indeed.

726
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Aunt, stop joking.

727
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,360
I'm serious.

728
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,930
You two are a match made in heaven.

729
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,250
Perfect for each other.

730
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,250
Mr. Fang.

731
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,840
Do you have a minute

732
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,410
to talk about
the company's investment issues?

733
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,040
Sure.

734
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,970
- Okay.
- Come with me.

735
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,600
Good.

736
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,080
Some people are made for each other,

737
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,490
while some are not.

738
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,280
Nana.

739
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,520
It's okay.

740
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,560
I remember that
Mengfei only invited Mr. Fang.

741
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
What right do you have

742
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,760
to be here?

743
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,450
It's none of your business.

744
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,250
Can you afford such an expensive dress?

745
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,730
Did you seduce another rich guy?

746
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,410
Watch your mouth, or you'll get hiccups.

747
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,170
Don't try to fool me.

748
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,040
I won't back down.

749
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,210
What's wrong?

750
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,970
Is it you?

751
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,800
Nana.

752
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,280
Are you okay?

753
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,560
- I'm fine.
- Get up.

754
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,360
Are you all right?

755
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,690
Wasn't he the one from last time?

756
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,280
Let me introduce myself.

757
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
My name is Jiang Shiyi.

758
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,650
I am the CEO

759
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,080
of The One Design.

760
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,120
President again?

761
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you obsessed with presidents?

762
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,280
Nana, stop it.

763
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,690
Are you Mr. Fang?

764
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,730
Nice to meet you.

765
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,930
No wonder your company's deal

766
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,010
came down so quickly last time.

767
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,760
It is all thanks to you, Mr. Jiang.

768
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,760
Mr. Fang, you flatter me.

769
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,730
Hello.

770
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,040
I am the CEO of Future Group.

771
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,010
My name is Fang Leng.

772
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,210
You flatter me, Mr. Fang.

773
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,080
I always keep business
and personal separate.

774
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,800
It's all thanks to Xiaoqi's own efforts

775
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,520
to get everyone's approval.

776
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,930
I really envy you, Mr. Fang,

777
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,250
for having such a good staff.

778
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,250
Since you are so appreciative,

779
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,600
I might as well be nice.

780
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,650
You don't have to come to work tomorrow.

781
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,410
Why won't he let me go to work?

782
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,210
I'll talk to him.

783
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,840
Fang Leng.

784
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,520
Fang Leng is actually jealous.

785
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,280
What...

786
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,760
What is wrong with people nowadays?

787
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,410
Instead of Michelin,

788
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,730
he insists on eating
from a roadside stall.

789
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,320
Enough, stop talking.

790
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,280
This reception is a good one.

791
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,080
- Nice setup.
- Yes.

792
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,040
Are you still angry at me?

793
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,410
You won't be angry when you see this.

794
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,040
You must be tired
after all this hard work.

795
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,800
You're trying to please me

796
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,690
and Jiang Shiyi at the same time.

797
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,280
I didn't expect you
to be such a tactful person.

798
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,890
I just want to apologise to you.

799
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,520
Don't be so rude.

800
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,490
Besides, I've apologised
to you so many times,

801
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,890
yet you're still not happy.

802
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,600
Apologise?

803
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,770
Did you know that an apology

804
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,120
is the most
hypocritical thing in the world?

805
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,640
And do you really
want to ask my forgiveness

806
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,330
or do you want to
make yourself feel better?

807
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
I have to get your forgiveness

808
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,930
before I can feel better.

809
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,330
This is not a conflict, isn't it?

810
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,160
Then your apology is too selfish.

811
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,770
Selfish?

812
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,120
I came here to help you get sponsorship,

813
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,450
but you say I'm selfish.

814
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,200
If I'm selfish,

815
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,160
I wouldn't have agreed to Shiyi,

816
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,770
let alone come here, okay?

817
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,330
Shiyi?

818
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,810
I really didn't expect

819
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,410
you two to get close so quickly.

820
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,290
So are you saying

821
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,850
you're with him because of me?

822
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,200
Yes. I'm glad you know.

823
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,970
Then you don't have to worry
about Research Department anymore.

824
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,890
I set it up because
of pheromone perfumes.

825
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,410
The idea of pheromone perfumes

826
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,680
came about because of you.

827
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,810
If that's why

828
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,160
you've been struggling,

829
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,450
then from now on,

830
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
I will officially cancel the project.

831
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,640
You don't have to get
any more financial support for it.

832
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,810
How can you just give up

833
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,930
when you've held on for so long?

834
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,930
Because I am so sick
of the sight of you.

835
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,560
I don't want to keep this going.

836
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,450
How can I put it?

837
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,010
The preceding is still reasonable.

838
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,680
Fang Leng.

839
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,200
Let me introduce to you.

840
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,410
This is Mr. Gu from Sanshu Technology.

841
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,240
Hello.

842
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,040
Listen.

843
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,290
I've got to go first.

844
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,520
Aren't you going to send me back?

845
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,490
Ms. Chen.

846
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,240
If it's not convenient for Mr. Fang,

847
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,410
I can send you home.

848
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,330
Thank you.

849
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,330
Why are you out here?

850
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,410
Shiyi, do you...

851
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,970
Do you find me annoying?

852
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,200
Then do you hate me?

853
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,010
No.

854
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,770
I think you are gentle, kind

855
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,120
and helpful.

856
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,370
Of course I don't hate you.

857
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,890
I also think you are kind,

858
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,330
cute

859
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,720
and funny.

860
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,770
If you are annoying,

861
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,410
then no one

862
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,930
in the world is worth liking.

863
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,680
Xiaoqi.

864
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,680
Look at the moon.

865
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,970
Some people find it

866
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,520
serene and beautiful,

867
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
others find it

868
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,450
indefinite.

869
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,370
It's the same for us.

870
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,970
We can't please everyone.

871
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,490
So

872
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,010
just be yourself.

873
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,120
Also,

874
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,600
According to the law
of conservation of mass,

875
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,640
if someone makes you sad,

876
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,450
someone else will make you happy.

877
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,160
Eat some candy.

878
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,290
You can have as much as you want.

879
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,450
Okay.

880
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,560
Thanks.

881
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,970
Why am I still unhappy

882
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
even though I ate candy this time?

883
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,370
Xiaoqi.

884
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,200
Do you know why

885
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,600
I carry candies with me?

886
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,770
I had no friends when I was a kid.

887
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,410
Whatever happened,
I had to take it on myself.

888
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,600
Once I was so sad

889
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,290
that I hid in the garden alone.

890
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,010
Then a little girl came
and handed me a piece of candy.

891
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,040
She told me that eating
candy would make me happy.

892
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,330
Eat one

893
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,970
and you'll be happy.

894
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,370
That was the first time
someone cared about me.

895
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,770
What happened then?

896
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,490
Then I looked at her smile

897
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,520
and I smiled back.

898
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,370
You can recall

899
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,040
your childhood events so well.

900
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,370
It seems

901
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,330
that memory is very important to you.

902
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,810
Yes.

903
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,330
So since then,

904
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,810
I've been smiling a lot.

905
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,850
I want to spread my smile

906
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,240
to all the people around me.

907
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,720
So, Xiaoqi,

908
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,240
As your friend, I have to tell you

909
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,040
that you look best when you smile.

910
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,200
That's all.

911
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,810
Do you think this party is boring?

912
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,330
Let's go. I'll take you home.

913
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,410
Okay, let's go home.

914
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,600
Okay.

915
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,680
Are you sure you don't
want me to walk you in?

916
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,040
It's fine.

917
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,770
I want to walk alone.

918
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,490
Xiaoqi.

919
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,040
Okay.

920
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,770
I'll get going.

921
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,010
Bye.
