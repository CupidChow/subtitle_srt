I have further refined the classification.

Mr. Fang, which one
do you want to see first?

23
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:45,158
Romantic relationships.

24

The women you've forgotten this time include

25
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:47,837
(Mary, 24, international model)
Mary, whom you met at the investment reception party.

26
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:49,158
She only met you once,

27
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:51,277
but she goes around claiming
you are her good brother.

Are you sure you're not
hiding anything from me?

47

Mr. Fang,

48
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,278
I'd never hide everything from you.

49
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,318
You know that.

50
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,357
What about Chai Xiaoqi?

51
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:29,598
So you found out?

52
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,438
I didn't mean

53
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,118
to leak the perfume idea.

54
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:36,197
It's because Mr. Zhou
was being sarcastic.

55
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:36,998
I got upset

56
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:38,878
and let it slip.

57
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:40,357
So,

58
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:44,477
are you telling me that
instead of Chai Xiaoqi,

59
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,038
you leaked the news?

60
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:50,598
Were you not asking about
who leaked the perfume idea?

61
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:53,357
I wouldn't have revealed it then.

62
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:54,598
What did you just say?

63
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:55,718
I said

64
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,438
I should have told you.

65
00:02:57,438 --> 00:03:00,118
My image of a loyal subordinate

66
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:00,917
is ruined.

67
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,278
I will deduct your year-end bonus
for the next three years.

68
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,598
Mr. Fang, I haven't even
worked for that long.

69
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:06,517
Mr. Fang,

70
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,318
what exactly do you want to ask me?

71
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,278
Why is there no information
about Chai Xiaoqi

72
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,598
in the memory vault?

73
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,318
Ms. Chai is neither your girlfriend

74
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:16,797
nor work partner.

75
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:18,718
Her data has never even been
keyed into the memory vault.

76
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:22,197
Wait a second.

77
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:23,077
Mr. Fang,

78
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:24,957
didn't it rain just now?

79
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:26,917
Why do you still remember Ms. Chai?

80
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:28,757
Are you sure the memory vault

81
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:30,278
isn't missing any information?

82
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:31,598
The information

83
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,957
was given to me directly by Dr. Zhang.

84
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:33,957
There shouldn't be any mistake,

85
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:36,038
unless

86
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,718
you're dating in secret.

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,040
(Chai Xiaoqi, 22, how we met)

(No information on family background)

90
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,957
You went to Los Angeles for
a three-month work trip last year.

91
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:52,197
During this time, your
heterosexual memory bank

92
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:54,038
didn't have any data update.

93
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,398
I think that's when

94
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:56,517
you met Chai Xiaoqi.

95
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:58,357
After all, you didn't
bring your assistant.

96
00:03:58,357 --> 00:03:59,438
Nor did you contact me.

97
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:00,998
That's why no one knows about it.

98
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,637
I just checked the date.

99
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:04,637
On the day before you
came back to China,

100
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:06,438
it rained heavily in Los Angeles.

101
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:09,318
I guess it's because of the rain

102
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:11,517
that you forgot about her
before you came back.

103
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:13,718
Chai Xiaoqi is the daughter
of your neighbour.

104
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:15,438
It seems that she just came
back to China not long ago.

105
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,038
It seems she's really my ex-girlfriend.

106
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:22,677
However, I'm curious.

107
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:24,677
Why do I still remember her

108
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:26,078
after it rains this time?

109
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:29,557
Human memory needs to
be deepened continuously.

110
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:32,398
Perhaps your encounter with her

111
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,557
left a lasting impression on you.

112
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:36,797
On top of it, the stimulation
of a rainy day

113
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:38,598
made you recall

114
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,078
she's your ex-girlfriend.

115
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:42,638
The memories of these moments merge.

116
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:45,029
That's why you didn't
forget her this time.

117
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,109
Why would I fall for this type of girl?

118
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,428
You'll have to ask yourself that.

119
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:52,669
I'll mark it for you.

Are you sure the content of the book

can help you to deal with Fang Leng?

127

Why do I feel that it's unreliable?

128
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,149
Chai told me to read it.

129
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,469
Then it must be useful.

130
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:13,508
Look.

131
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880

(I know what happened in the past.)

133
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:26,628
What does he know?

134
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:28,628
He must have remembered

135
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,388
that he forced me to marry him.

136
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,829
Isn't your wedding

a year later?

138
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:35,068
How could he possibly remember?

139
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,068
Then it must be

140
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,269
because the space and
time have messed up

141
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:39,548
after I arrived.

142
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,388
Think about the positive side.

143
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:43,789
Maybe

144
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:45,508
he sent it to a wrong person.

145
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,360
(Fang Leng:
Let's meet in the afternoon.)

146
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,109
Not only he did not
withdraw the message,

147
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,628
he even wants me to talk to him.

148
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,548
Does he wish to clarify things with me?

149
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:59,789
So what even if

150
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:01,589
he remembers the past?

00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:04,748

155
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:13,548
then I'll definitely help you.

156
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:16,029
Really?

157
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:17,909
We're husband and wife.

Don't you know his character?

I'll help you,

00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:44,149
provided that you'll help me, too.

168
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:46,669
What is it?

169
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,589
I heard that your blood

170
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,308
would turn into sapphire.

171
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,548
I know.

172
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,669
It seems that this is called
Hongmen Banquet on earth

173
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:09,988
or the last supper.

174
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,829
Xiaoqi, how about
this? I'll go with you.

175
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,388
If he bullies you, I'll

176
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,388
use my electric shock on him.

177
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:17,308
No.

178
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:19,149
No, Xiaobu, I can't do it.

179
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,709
I'll do something so dangerous

180
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,109
by myself.

181
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:23,229
Anyway,

182
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:25,948
remember to repair your signaller

183
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,349
and go home.

184
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:28,948
Take good care of yourself.

185
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,428
Xiaoqi,

186
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:33,029
without you,

187
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,628
no one will praise me for being smart.

188
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,229
Xiaoqi.

189
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:39,909
It's all right.

190
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,188
Don't worry.

191
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,628
Everything will be fine.

192
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,349
Don't be scared.

193
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:47,308
Mr. Fang,

194
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,789
I think it's inappropriate

195
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,188
for me to be here.

196
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:51,628
Have you got all the stuff ready?

197
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:53,508
Yes.

198
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:56,388
If Ms. Chai said, "Let's
cherish the relationship"

199
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:57,909
and she doesn't wish to break up,

200
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,508
we'll give her this car key.

201
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:00,789
If she says

202
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,469
that she can't be bought with money,

203
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,508
we'll give her this bank card.

204
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,149
If she says true love is priceless,

205
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,188
give her this checkbook

206
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:10,508
for her to write any amount.

207
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,308
However,

208
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,868
I think Ms. Chai has integrity

209
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:16,868
and a unique personality.

210
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,229
She might not even come today.

211
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:22,508
I'm here.

212
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,188
What's the matter?

213
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,868
I finally know what kind
of person you are.

214
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:34,668
(Oh no.)

215
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,668
(He knows everything.)

216
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:39,628
In fact...

217
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,189
You just want to have me again.

218
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,309
What?

219
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:45,868
Have you?

220
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:46,788
Again?

221
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,508
Ms. Chai,

222
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,908
No wonder I thought you looked like

223
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,549
my future lady boss when I saw you.

224
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:55,709
So you guys were really in love.

225
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,189
She's just my ex-girlfriend.

226
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:58,309
Your ex-girlfriend?

227
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,069
We're married, okay?

228
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,908
You forced me into the marriage.

229
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,109
Dream on.

230
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,949
Ms. Chai, all right.

231
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,908
Don't get mad at Mr. Fang.

232
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,829
Mr. Fang quarrelled
with you the other day

233
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,908
because he thought you
leaked our fragrance plan.

234
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:19,949
Sorry, Ms. Chai.

235
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:21,829
It's all my fault

236
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:24,028
that your relationship is affected.

237
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:26,788
What do you mean?

238
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:32,189
Was that why

239
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,388
you screamed at me?

240
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,628
What else?

241
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:35,949
Nothing.

242
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:37,508
Surely, there's nothing else.

243
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,349
(This is great.)

244
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:42,668
(He doesn't even know my real identity.)

245
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:44,829
Anyway,

246
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,109
nothing will ever happen between us.

247
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:48,868
No matter how hard you try,

248
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:51,109
I'll never reconcile with you.

249
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:52,388
Rest assured.

250
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:53,829
I've never even thought about trying.

251
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,748
Actually, I'm not your ex
[*also sounds like "money]...

252
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:57,229
Money can buy everything.

253
00:09:57,469 --> 00:09:58,748
I knew you would say that.

254
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,309
This is to compensate you.

255
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:06,388
What's this?

256
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:07,469
Is it worth a lot?

257
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:09,829
She thinks it's too little.

258
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:17,949
Besides these,

259
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,788
as long as you disappear from my sight,

260
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:22,229
I can compensate you with anything

261
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,109
that you want.

262
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:31,549
Really?

263
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:33,748
She's indeed a greedy person.

264
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:36,589
How about this?

265
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,429
I'll give you some time

266
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:39,469
to think about it.

267
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,469
Contact me again

268
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:42,388
when you've thought of what you want.

269
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:55,628
Compensation?

270
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,788
What should I ask for?

271
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,280
(Priceless Ex-girlfriend:
Cold President, Please Regret)

272
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:06,268
When a guy offers to make it up to you,

273
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:08,748
he's actually implying that you can

274
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:12,589
ask for more physical contact
and intimacy from him.

275
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,309
If that's how Fang Leng compensates you,

276
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,589
we'll be able to collect
Hormone Element very soon.

277
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,148
I'm so smart.

278
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,868
It's a better bargain
than that bank card.

279
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:28,388
However, why does Fang Leng think that

280
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,628
you are his ex-girlfriend?

281
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:31,508
He must be a playboy.

282
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,829
He might have mistaken
me for someone else.

283
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:35,668
Do you know how I found out?

284
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,668
He rejected me

285
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:39,589
as if he'd done it a hundred times.

286
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,189
It makes me feel that

287
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,148
I'm not his only girlfriend.

288
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:45,668
However, it's great that

289
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,469
we managed to trick Fang Leng.

290
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:52,788
Isn't it bad that I lied?

291
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,148
You shouldn't have lied,

292
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:57,868
but Fang Leng deserved it.

293
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,589
He's a bad guy who has bullied you.

294
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:00,309
That's right.

295
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,028
Deceiving bad people
is honesty to good people.

296
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:04,788
Xiaoqi, you are doing a good deed.

297
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,309
Yes, I'm doing a good deed.

298
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:08,868
Besides, when our
mission is completed,

299
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:11,189
we can go home soon.

300
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,949
We'll go home.

301
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,469
(I know how you  should compensate me.)

302
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,388
(I want you to accompany
me to eat and go shopping)

303
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,549
(and be on call 24/7.)

304
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:50,189
Ms. Chai.

305
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:54,788
Ms. Chai.

306
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:55,589
Where's Fang Leng?

307
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,388
Mr. Fang asked me to accompany
you to eat and go shopping.

308
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,949
I have everything planned.

309
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,589
Hold on.

310
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:06,628
After we eat,

311
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:07,589
we'll watch a movie

312
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,628
called The Domineering Boss
Is In Love with Me.

313
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,748
Then, we'll go shopping.

314
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,829
I booked a Michelin restaurant
for dinner.

315
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,429
I guarantee that it'll suit your taste.

316
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,549
After dinner,

317
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,868
let's go for foot treatment,
ear picking and bone setting,

318
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:20,109
on top of aromatherapy spa.

319
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,229
Ms. Chai,

320
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,788
are you satisfied with my service?

321
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,189
You're too much.

322
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,229
Don't worry.

323
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,668
All the expenses today
will be paid by Mr. Fang.

324
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,148
He's trying to brush me off.

325
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:36,429
Ms. Chai!

326
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,069
Fang Leng, what should I do?

327
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,668
I just discovered my kitchen pipe

328
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:44,148
seems to be broken.

329
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,148
I can't use the kitchen.

330
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,549
I think you have to come and repair it.

331
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,069
Come quickly, I'm waiting.

332
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:09,788
Fang Leng, I think I injured my arm

333
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:11,949
while trying to repair the kitchen pipe.

334
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:12,908
It hurts.

335
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,589
You might have to give me a massage

336
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:15,988
in person.

337
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:17,748
Thank you. Hurry up.

338
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,028
What took you so long?

339
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:25,148
I'm so tired,

340
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:26,469
I can't do the repair work.

341
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,788
Han, maintenance at your service.

342
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:31,309
What are you doing?

343
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,349
You might not know,

344
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:34,628
but I'm very good at
home appliances repair.

345
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,429
Just leave it to me.

346
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:38,148
I didn't ask you...

347
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:39,069
Ms. Chai,

348
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:40,148
where is the broken pipe?

349
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,508
You're too much.

350
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:47,949
Hold on, you two.

351
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:53,309
Mr. Han ate with me last time.

352
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:54,189
This time I need help
to repair the plumbing.

353
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,388
Again, you asked Mr. Han to come.

354
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:56,589
Who is the one compensating me?

355
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:58,309
Future Group sells makeup.

356
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,349
Do I have to try every lipstick myself?

357
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:01,028
Besides,

358
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:03,949
I have sent my best staff to you

359
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,668
and compensated you.

360
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,069
Isn't that enough?

361
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:10,469
Mr. Fang,

362
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:12,429
am I your best employee?

363
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:16,429
Fine.

364
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,268
Since Mr. Han is doing the plumbing,

365
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:21,668
meanwhile,

366
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:23,589
you can

367
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,589
give me a massage.

368
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,309
My right hand really

369
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:29,109
hurts so badly.

370
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,709
Quick, massage it for me.

371
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:32,709
Mr. Han.

372
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:58,628
Master Han, the masseur,

373
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,388
is at your service.

374
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:03,748
Ms. Chai,

375
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:05,268
which part is unwell?

376
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:14,429
Mr...

377
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:16,148
Mr. Fang, look at her.

378
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:21,028
I can only say that with
thorough understanding,

379
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,069
there is no battle you can't win.

380
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:24,589
Keep going.

381
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:42,429
You can eat mine.

382
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:45,589
Xiaoqi,

383
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:47,148
are you upset?

384
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,589
I don't understand

385
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,229
why I see him less

386
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:52,709
after becoming his ex-girlfriend.

387
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,109
Is an ex-girlfriend like a plague?

388
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:56,868
Why is he avoiding me?

389
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:59,229
Ex-girlfriend?

390
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,160
(Key word, ex-girlfriend, searching)

391
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,980
(Result)

392
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,388
(Result) (5% white lotus)
Based on data analysis on earth,

393
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:09,188
(2% borrowing money) (90% back-up)
Five percent of men think that

394
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,269
their ex-girlfriends
are like white lotus.

395
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,188
It's best not to disturb them.

396
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,789
Three percent of men think that

397
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,269
ex-girlfriends are the least
expensive flirt subjects.

398
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,789
Meanwhile, 2% of men think that

399
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,948
occasionally borrowing
money from ex-girlfriend

400
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:20,989
isn't a bad idea.

401
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:23,388
The remaining 90% of men think that

402
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:24,868
compared to their current girlfriends,

403
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:26,188
ex-girlfriends are pretty good, too.

404
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:27,109
As long as you don't
delete their WeChat,

405
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,549
there is a possibility of
getting back together.

406
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:32,269
As for avoiding an ex-girlfriend
like she's a plague,

407
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:33,509
this can only be

408
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,269
because

409
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:38,468
he owes you money.

410
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:39,789
He owes me money?

411
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:41,829
He's so rich.

412
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,269
Why would he owe me money?

413
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:45,029
You're right.

414
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
(Fang Leng)

415
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,560
(Fang Leng, continue analyzing.)

416
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,080
(System is analyzing Fang Leng.)

417
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,228
Fang Leng is too complicated

418
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,868
for the system to analyse.

419
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,668
Nevermind then.

420
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,349
Stop thinking. Forget it.

421
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:16,989
Xiaoqi,

422
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:18,388
maybe I can ask Fang Lie.

423
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,069
He must know Fang Leng better than us.

424
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,708
Don't bother.

425
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,148
They're siblings.

426
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:24,549
Of course he won't tell you.

427
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:30,269
Don't worry.

428
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:33,468
He will, as long as I grant his wishes.

429
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,980
(Fang Lie)

430
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,680
(Girlfriend)

431
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,210
(You mentioned we should help
make our loved one's dream come true.)

432
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,920
(I know what to do now!)

433
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,989
(Girlfriend, Huapai Hotel, room 625)
Teach me what to do.

434
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,388
(Girlfriend, Huapai Hotel, room 625)
Why do we have to go to a hotel?

435
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,800
(How do boys protect themselves
out there?)

436
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,380
(Self-made mustard essential oil spray)

437
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:08,789
(Self-made mustard essential oil spray)
In the society nowadays,

438
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,148
there are more and more lusty people.

439
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:13,188
Young boys have become

440
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,668
a vulnerable group.

441
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:15,948
When you're outside,

442
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,829
especially in enclosed spaces,

443
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,269
you must be careful

444
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,948
and see if the other party is
planning something against you.

445
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,908
Xiaobu won't do
anything to me, will she?

446
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:32,989
Come on, hurry.

447
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,148
Hurry up.

448
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:34,989
Stop wasting time.

449
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,309
What do you mean?

450
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,509
Of course it's to meet
your need in love.

451
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:45,829
Wait, don't get me wrong.

452
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,628
I don't have any need in particular.

453
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:55,628
Don't you want to be a painter?

454
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,309
Starting today,

455
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:58,749
I'll teach you how to paint.

456
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,029
So, that's what you meant.

457
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,628
What else did you think it was?

458
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,188
Nothing.

459
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:05,908
Nothing.

460
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,668
There's absolutely no other meaning.

461
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,708
This is my mouth spray.

462
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,789
Are you okay?

463
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:21,868
You...

464
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:27,309
Why is he moved to tears?

465
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:32,029
Did you just say you wanted
to teach me how to draw?

466
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:36,349
Are you sure you can teach me?

467
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,349
Today,

468
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:40,589
I'll be your model.

469
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:41,269
Go ahead and paint.

470
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,148
I'll take a look at your level first.

471
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:44,948
Come on.

472
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,428
(I've satisfied his needs.)

473
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:02,069
(It should be okay to ask
questions now, right?)

474
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:05,628
Fang Lie,

475
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:08,309
do you have any other sibling?

476
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:09,029
Yes.

477
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:10,668
I have an older brother.

478
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:11,908
If it wasn't him,

479
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,029
I wouldn't have been able to
paint here with peace of mind.

480
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:15,589
We have our respective roles.

481
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,708
He's in charge of making
money for the family.

482
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,829
I'm in charge of being handsome.

483
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,628
You must know your brother well.

484
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:23,468
Of course.

485
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:24,789
He's my biological brother.

486
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:25,989
Of course I know him best.

487
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:28,468
Do you know if your brother

488
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:29,948
severs ties

489
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:32,069
with his ex-girlfriends

490
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,549
or does he have
lingering feelings for them?

491
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:37,309
(Why are we talking about
my brother out of the blue?)

492
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:38,668
(No.)

493
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,188
(It's definitely not that simple.)

494
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:43,148
(It must be because Xiaobu
wants to know me better,)

495
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:44,868
(but is too shy to say it.)

496
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:50,708
No matter what my brother
thinks about his ex-girlfriends,

497
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,789
I definitely don't
have an ex-girlfriend.

498
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,029
What about your brother?

499
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:58,509
What kind of girls is he attracted to?

500
00:21:58,509 --> 00:21:59,829
(She still won't admit it.)

501
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:02,708
(Actually, she just wants
to know my type.)

502
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:04,668
I am very loyal.

503
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:06,989
No matter how others
try to please me,

504
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:08,509
I won't change my mind.

505
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,668
I'm talking about your brother.

506
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,148
Your brother.

507
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:14,789
(She's being shy.)

508
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:16,509
(Well, I'm not going to expose her.)

509
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:19,109
I know. I know you're
talking about my brother.

510
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:20,749
If you have any other
question about my brother,

511
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:21,708
just ask away.

512
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:28,668
It doesn't matter if my
brother likes the homely

513
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:29,989
or wilful type,

514
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:31,908
I only have eyes for my girlfriend.

515
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:34,708
Okay.

516
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,868
You are the best.

517
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,509
(She must be deeply impressed)

518
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:38,789
(by my perfect personality.)

519
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:40,029
I'm done.

520
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:45,589
Why is there only an apple?

521
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:47,109
What about me?

522
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,388
What do you mean by
there's only an apple?

523
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:50,668
Look.

524
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:52,668
I didn't draw the apple on the table

525
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,349
or the one in the bowl.

526
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:56,309
It's the apple on top of your head.

527
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,188
Although you're not pictured,

528
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:01,428
in fact, it has a lot to do with you.

529
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:03,509
If you don't believe me, look carefully.

530
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:04,948
See if its details

531
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,148
are a little different.

532
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,749
The perspective is wrong.

533
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,868
That's why the shadow
of the drawn object

534
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:20,989
varies in length.

535
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:23,029
Also, the altitude of the sun just now

536
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:24,589
obviously didn't change much.

537
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:26,948
However, the saturation
of the colours you used

538
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,789
are slightly lower than
the actual colours.

539
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,789
The most important thing is that

540
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:32,428
there's a blemish on the apple.

541
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,868
Where did it go?

542
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:35,789
You're an expert.

543
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:39,029
I call it reasonable
beautification process.

544
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:41,228
It allows certain
deviation from reality,

545
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:42,388
just like girls

546
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:44,428
taking selfies with the beauty filter.

547
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:45,868
There's also a slight difference

548
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:48,269
from reality.

549
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:49,989
Besides, I always paint still life.

550
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:51,269
I'm so sick of it.

551
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,628
I have no inspiration at all.

552
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:11,148
What's this?

553
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,349
Incredible glasses.

554
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,228
It can project any scene.

555
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:16,989
Is it that powerful?

556
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:19,628
What if I want to go to outer space?

557
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,188
Close your eyes.

558
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:30,349
Can I open my eyes now?

559
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:31,829
Go ahead.

560
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,109
This is too realistic.

561
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,269
It's all right. This isn't real.

562
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,749
Aren't you looking for inspiration?

563
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,989
Go ahead.

564
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:52,428
Inspiration.

565
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:55,148
Here I come.

566
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,188
Compared to the universe,

567
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:16,188
human beings are insignificant.

568
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:27,069
Xiaobu,

569
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,109
do you sometimes feel

570
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:32,549
that your existence

571
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:34,148
doesn't even matter?

572
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:41,829
Strictly speaking,

573
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:43,708
I am indeed replicable.

574
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,708
However, that doesn't mean
my existence is meaningless.

575
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:57,989
At home,

576
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:02,388
I am a child with caring parents

577
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,228
and an older brother who looks after me.

578
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,908
That makes me think that I'm

579
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:07,188
irreplaceable.

580
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:09,668
Now,

581
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:11,989
I can't even go back to my own house.

582
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:18,309
You just need to pluck up
your courage to go home.

583
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:22,148
However, I have to fix
my computer system.

584
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:27,549
By the way, Xiaobu,

585
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:32,628
I know a few places that
might be able to help you.

586
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:38,069
Sorry to keep you waiting.

587
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:38,749
Thanks.

588
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:41,829
Please come again.

589
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:44,868
Why is there no order

590
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:47,029
from Future Group at all?

591
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,269
Maybe Fang Leng won't let his staff

592
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,228
order takeout from our restaurant.

593
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:54,349
He's really trying his best to avoid me.

594
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:57,549
Han makes your life easier.

595
00:27:58,388 --> 00:27:59,428
Mr. Han,

596
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:01,948
when will your compensation be over?

597
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:03,309
Ms. Chai,

598
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,109
Mr. Fang said that

599
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,829
as long as you'd give him up,

600
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,708
then everything would be back to normal.

601
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:10,349
Back to normal?

602
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,188
So, everything has to
start from the beginning?

603
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,029
Mr. Fang,

604
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:20,589
I've sorted out

605
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,029
Ms. Chai's requests
in the past few days.

606
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,509
Mr. Fang,

607
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:31,948
you didn't date anyone
because of amnesia.

608
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:34,228
Now, finally there's someone

609
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:35,309
whom you will not forget.

610
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:36,829
Why don't you consider her?

611
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:37,628
Besides,

612
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,868
I think Ms. Chai is warm and kind.

613
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:42,589
Most importantly, she's thick-skinned.

614
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,868
She never gives up after
being rejected so many times.

615
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:47,749
She's comparable to me in that sense.

616
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:48,868
Mr. Han,

617
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,589
have you finished your resignation letter?

618
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:55,829
Why should I write a resignation...

619
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,069
I got it.

620
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:14,109
(How To Make Domineering President Love You Part Three)
When you get close with him,

621
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:18,948
you can whisper
a few words into his ear.

622
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:24,269
This will heighten the ambiguous
atmosphere between you.

623
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,188
Xiaoqi,

624
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:28,989
come and learn a few
sentences from here.

625
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:29,908
They're very useful.

626
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,668
However, even if I've learnt those,

627
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,269
I have nowhere to put it to practice.

628
00:29:39,188 --> 00:29:40,868
An Unknown Matchmaker.

629
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:42,829
Who is this man?

630
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:44,309
It's him again.

631
00:29:44,628 --> 00:29:45,989
Let's see what he has to say this time.

632
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:49,029
(An Unknown Yue Lao)
Men look cold and tough,

633
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:52,069
(but deep down they're actually
creatures full of sympathy.)

634
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,428
(If his attitude is ambiguous)

635
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:55,509
(and he even refuses to have
direct contact with you,)

636
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,109
(I suggest the method
of pretending to be sick)

637
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:00,069
(to stimulate his desire to protect.)

638
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:01,668
Why does this matchmaker

639
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:03,029
seem to know me well?

640
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,040
(An Unknown Yue Lao)

641
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:06,428
(I forgot to say just now.)

642
00:30:06,428 --> 00:30:07,549
(After you succeed,)

643
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,109
(please remember those who
have helped you along the way,)

644
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,509
(especially the right-hand man
who is silent)

645
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,866
(but always on standby.)

646
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:16,228
That makes sense.

647
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:17,549
Xiaoqi,

648
00:30:17,908 --> 00:30:19,829
when you and Mr. Fang become a couple,

649
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:22,228
you must thank me properly.

650
00:30:22,228 --> 00:30:24,509
I put in a lot of effort

651
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:26,628
to bring you together.

652
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:29,589
However, Chai,

653
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,228
pretending to be sick

654
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,309
requires acting skills, right?

655
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,628
You sat through the dinner last time.

656
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:36,228
Pretending to be sick

657
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:38,109
will be nothing to you.

658
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,840
(Sunny Apartment)

659
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:18,908
What are you doing?

660
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:20,309
I'm ill.

661
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:22,029
I know.

662
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:22,989
No,

663
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:24,388
I'm not mentally ill.

664
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,509
My body is feeling real pain.

665
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:28,908
I'm ill. I'm really ill.

666
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:30,309
Chai Xiaoqi,

667
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:32,109
what are you up to?

668
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:33,628
I'll give you anything you want,

669
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:36,549
but stop wasting time by doing this.

670
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:39,148
So this is how asthenia feels. Gosh.

671
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:41,309
When you develop this symptom,

672
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:42,989
you become weak all over,
including your limbs.

673
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:43,908
Gosh.

674
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:45,829
Look at me.

675
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:49,829
Am I really pale right now?

676
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,029
Who are you?

677
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:55,148
I even have amnesia now.

678
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:56,509
I think you're an idiot.

679
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:58,069
I'm not an idiot.

680
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:58,948
I'm really...

681
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:02,228
Fang Leng.

682
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:10,628
Stop pretending.

683
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:22,948
Did you really sprain your ankle?

684
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:01,349
When you get close to him,

685
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:05,188
you can whisper a few words into his ear

686
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:08,749
to heighten the ambiguous
atmosphere between you.

687
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,789
Do you know that the stars and I...

688
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:14,789
What are you saying?

689
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:16,989
Do you know

690
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:19,708
the difference between me and the stars?

691
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:21,908
Aren't you both primates?

692
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,628
Not king kongs, it's...

693
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:26,668
Nevermind.

694
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:33,388
(This unknown matchmaker)

695
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,749
(is really good.)

696
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:36,749
(Are all the bad guys on earth)

697
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:38,388
(so good-looking?)

698
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:41,069
(He sees that I'm ill.)

699
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:42,668
(Is he going to take care of me?)

700
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:46,829
Let go!

701
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:48,349
Let...

702
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:53,948
What are you doing?

703
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:56,589
What do you mean?

704
00:33:57,188 --> 00:33:58,109
Fang Leng.

705
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:03,708
What kind of a person is he?

706
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:21,708
The password...

707
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:23,708
Chai.

708
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:27,308
Xiaobu, are you home?

709
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,708
Chai and Xiaobu, I'm back.

710
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,869
Open the door.

711
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,589
No way, this is bad.

712
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:37,549
My foot is sprained and I can't go home.

713
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:40,469
Chai and Xiaobu ignored my messages.

714
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,228
What a miserable alien...

715
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:48,549
You're so handsome.

716
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,469
Why didn't you open the door just now?

717
00:34:58,509 --> 00:34:59,429
I need to save Xiaoqi.

718
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,589
No.

719
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:01,708
Stay still!

720
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,788
It's my first time!

721
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:05,469
- Your first time?
- Take it easy!

722
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:06,828
There's always
a first time for everyone.

723
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,228
- Xiaoqi!
- It hurts so much.

724
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:09,668
Can you be gentler?

725
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:12,228
Take it off!

726
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:13,308
Don't move.

727
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:14,549
- Be gentler!
- Take it off!

728
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:19,228
- It hurts. Do it gently.
- Xiaoqi!

729
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:20,228
Stay still.

730
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:22,549
- It really hurts.
- Xiaobu.

731
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:25,308
- She's succeeding now.
- Do it gently.

732
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:26,308
Stay still!

733
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:28,509
Don't move.

734
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:31,668
- Xiaobu!
- It really hurts.

735
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:36,869
Xiaoqi!

736
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:40,668
Don't move.

737
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,549
It hurts. Be gentle.

738
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:46,628
It's my first time!

739
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:48,148
Don't move.

740
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:50,069
It's painful to apply
medicine for the first time.

741
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:51,389
Can't you take it easy?

742
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,668
There's always a first
time for everyone.

743
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:54,589
Liar.

744
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,748
You said no one was home.

745
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,148
That's why I'll let you stay the night.

746
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:10,788
Are you asking me

747
00:36:10,788 --> 00:36:12,109
to sleep in the guest room by myself?

748
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:15,348
Aren't you feeling weak?

749
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:18,389
I am.

750
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:21,549
I just had a flashback before death.

751
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:24,389
I'm really ill.

752
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:25,828
You should believe me.

753
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:27,828
Go to bed if you are sick.

754
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:30,748
No, I can't.

755
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:31,389
Listen,

756
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,828
I get cold when I'm sick at night.

757
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:34,788
I will feel very cold.

758
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:35,589
I'll feel really, really cold.

759
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:37,989
You have to keep me company.

760
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:41,188
I'm so cold. You have
to keep me company.

761
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:45,308
Okay.

762
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:16,509
(Is he going to kiss me?)

763
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:31,268
You won't feel cold anymore, right?

764
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:32,909
Yes.

765
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:34,589
No.

766
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,469
Why are you like this?

767
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:38,469
You used to be worried
sick whenever I felt cold.

768
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:41,148
You would hug me to sleep

769
00:37:41,148 --> 00:37:42,989
like this.

770
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:45,348
You would put your arms around me.

771
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:47,549
Hug you to sleep?

772
00:37:49,509 --> 00:37:50,148
Okay.

773
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:55,069
Wait here.

774
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:04,668
You won't feel cold this way, right?

775
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:06,909
(Let's see when you are
going to stop pretending.)

776
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:09,029
It's not cold. This
temperature is perfect.

777
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:11,788
Don't take your hat off.

778
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:13,188
Aren't you feeling cold?

779
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:14,308
Don't take it off.

780
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:18,228
You're breaking out in cold sweat.

781
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:19,029
Look.

782
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,069
I'll get you another one.

783
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:20,748
No!

784
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,589
There's no need to wait.

785
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:23,628
Well,

786
00:38:23,628 --> 00:38:26,029
have you forgotten

787
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,828
that I have a habit

788
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:30,589
of kicking off the blanket when I sleep?

789
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:33,869
Then I'll catch a cold,

790
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:34,949
right?

791
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:37,909
So, I still need your company.

792
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:39,268
Got it.

793
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:50,308
It's so hot.

794
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:54,869
It's hot. It's really hot in here.

795
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:16,628
(It's just collecting Hormone Element.)

796
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,748
(Are we really doing this?)

797
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,909

798
